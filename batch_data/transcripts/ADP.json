Thomas - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division Operator : Good morning. My name is Victoria, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Q1 2014 Automatic Data Processing Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Ms. Elena Charles, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Elena Charles : Thank you. I'm here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter fiscal 2014 earnings call and webcast. Starting today, we are modifying how we conduct ADP's investors calls. We are no longer speaking to formal presentation slides; however, a slide deck containing this quarter's financial results has been posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at adp.com. As a reminder, the quarterly history of revenue and pretax earnings for our reportable segments is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website. These schedules have been updated to include the first quarter of fiscal 2014. When you review these schedules, it is important to note that we have made changes to what is included in our segment reporting to align our financial reporting with how management views the businesses. As a result, effective this quarter, we are no longer allocating a cost of capital charge to the segments and all prior periods presented have been restated to conform. Additionally, we are no longer restating prior year segment results for current year budgeted foreign exchange rates for these periods. Rather, the segment results for the current and prior periods are presented at actual foreign exchange rate. As a result of these changes, you will no longer see reconciling items on our website schedules attributable to cost of capital or foreign exchange. And as we have gotten feedback from many of you on the effect of our restatements, the effect that the restatements have had on your model, this should greatly simplify your process. I'd like to remind everyone that during today's conference call, we will make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, as such, involve some risks, and these are discussed in our earnings release and in our periodic filings with the SEC. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Carlos for his opening remarks. Carlos A. Rodriguez: Thank you, Elena. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'd like to start the discussion with an update on how we are executing against our growth strategy and focus my comments on Human Capital Management, which we refer to as HCM. I will also provide my thoughts on our results and update you on how our business is doing. Then Jan will take you through the financial highlights for the quarter and our current forecast before we take your questions. From an overall standpoint, ADP is growing its integrated suite of cloud-based HCM, benefits and payroll solutions, which is at the core of who we are. I'm pleased to state that ADP is delivering on this growth initiative by enhancing and innovating across our HCM platforms for companies of all sizes. Our RUN platform for small businesses continues to sell well. Through our deep experience in servicing this segment of the market, ADP understands that small business owners need work solutions that are as effective as those used by larger organizations. We're pleased by the continued success of RUN and have about 285,000 clients on this platform. In fact, the number of RUN clients now exceeds the number of clients on our former platform by more than 2 :1. We also recently introduced exciting enhancements to our ADP Workforce Now and ADP Vantage HCM solutions in the U.S. Today, more than 40,000 employers who use these integrated platforms can benefit from some exciting innovations. We've added analytics that support data-driven decision-making, a new digital document management solution that stores the myriad of employee records within ADP's secure ecosystem, which average about 50 documents per employee, and a new global human resources system of record for U.S.-based midsize and larger businesses that helps to manage employee populations in multiple countries. It's important to note that our global Human Resources system of record build on ADP's long-standing expertise in managing the global needs of businesses. And finally, we've enhanced ADP's mobile solutions app, which is already used by nearly 1.5 million workers and is frequently rated as a top business app in iTunes. We realize that both employers and employees are dramatically changing how they do business and mobile is a large part of that story. I'm proud that ADP is pushing the boundaries of how mobile solutions help employers and employees manage their Human Resources need, and I view this as a market differentiator. The last product innovation that I want to leave you with today is our next-generation recruiting platform that we just introduced to the public at ADP's first innovation day. This sophisticated recruiting platform is a significant enhancement that rounds out the spectrum of our HCM solutions set. Its deep integration with social media differentiates ADP in the marketplace and is an important means for employers to identify top talents and communicate with prospective employees. I also want to discuss the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as ACA. You've heard us say that compliance has always been a key part of ADP's value proposition. And we believe that the ACA creates opportunity for ADP to assist our clients in managing numerous compliance requirements. ADP is uniquely positioned at the intersection of payroll, time and attendance and benefit administration, which is the core of our HCM solutions, making our platforms ideal for employers to navigate their responsibilities under ACA. I hope you're as excited as I am about the new innovations ADP has brought to market, and I look forward to sharing more with you on future calls. Now let's move to the first quarter results. ADP reported solid results for the first quarter, starting the fiscal year with strong revenue and earnings growth. I'm pleased that revenues grew 8% and earnings per share grew 10%. Our business segments performed well and achieved solid revenue growth during the quarter with good pretax margin expansion. Jan will take you through more of the details, but before he does, I'll provide you some comments on our business segments and more detail on Employer Services and PEO Services new bookings. Overall, Employer Services delivered solid results. The integration of Payroll S.A., a small but strategic acquisition we completed in Latin America in last year's fourth quarter is going well, and the business is performing in accordance with our expectations. Worldwide client revenue retention continued at a very strong level. As you read in this morning's press release, new business bookings growth from Employer Services and PEO was 1%. I want to remind you that in our last call, we've stated that our past experiences with very strong year end finishes, as with the case with this fourth quarter, often lead to soft first quarter bookings growth. In the U.S., small business bookings were very strong. However, large multinational enterprise market bookings fell short of last year's first quarter, due in large part to a very strong finish in fiscal 2013. I also want to remind you that these larger transactions create lumpiness in bookings growth from quarter-to-quarter. In the U.S., we are actively rebuilding the pipeline for potential new transactions. For large multinational companies, I'm pleased that the pipeline for potential multinational transactions for our GlobalView platform is growing. And we're investing in our sales force and plan to increase our sales headcount by 4% for the year. Our hires will be concentrated upmarket in the U.S. and in markets outside the U.S. Having said all this, we are confirming our guidance of 8% to 10% growth in new business bookings for the year. Turning from Employer Services, the PEO continue to grow nicely. Our PEO is the largest in the U.S. in terms of worksite employees, and I'm excited that we reached a new milestone, serving 300,000 worksite employees during the quarter. Moving on to Dealer Services. The outlook for the automotive landscape in North America is good, and the market forecast for calendar year 2013 vehicle sales is strong. The automotive landscape across Continental Europe is still soft, though our International business continues to grow on strength in the Asian markets. Dealer Services is also innovating through continued investment in digital and layered applications. For example, Dealer has exciting new cloud-based workflow platforms to seamlessly join predictive digital advertising in a superior consumer experience while significantly improving dealership productivity. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jan to provide the financial highlights and a look at the full year forecast. Jan Siegmund : Thank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. ADP delivered strong revenue growth of 8% for the quarter. Over 7% of this growth was organic. We achieved 7% pretax earnings growth, 9% net earnings growth on a lower effective tax rate and 10% EPS growth on fewer shares outstanding. These are very solid results in my view, and I'm pleased that revenue growth was strong across our business segments. Employer Services grew total revenues 8%, the PEO grew 12% and Dealer grew 7%. In Employer Services, revenue growth was across-the-board. Each of our strategic pillars, Human Capital Management, our HR BPO solutions, global and adjacent solutions contributed to growth this quarter. We continue to focus on providing excellent service to our clients, and as a result, we continue to enjoy strong client revenue retention. Additionally, as we continue to successfully migrate our existing client base to ADP Workforce Now and sell more bundled HCM solutions in the mid and large markets, we believe client retention rates are higher than our older standalone solutions. Same-store pays per control in U.S. Employer Services were strong, with an increase of 2.6%. However, same-store pays per control declined 0.8% across Europe as anticipated. Although the Eurozone recession has officially ended, economic growth lags the U.S. and unemployment remains high. Average client fund balances were strong during the quarter, increasing 8%, driven by new client growth, especially in small business services and increased pays per control. The positive impact from the January 1, 2013 expiration of Social Security tax holidays also contributed to balanced growth, and once anniversaried, the year-over-year comparison for balanced growth is expected to become more difficult in the second half of the year. Additionally, the holding period for certain tax liabilities was larger in the quarter than in last year's first quarter due to certain remittance dates falling on a weekend this year, and we anticipate this will reverse on us as we progress through the fiscal year. The PEO had a solid quarter with 12% revenue growth, driven by 11% average worksite employee growth. First quarter new business bookings were strong in the PEO. Moving on to Dealer Services. The North America core business drove just over half of the revenue growth in the quarter and benefited from continued strong transactional revenues. Revenues from digital advertising, websites and search are strong and growing. ADP's overall total pretax margin declined slightly for the quarter. Margin expansion in the business segments was offset by the negative impact from the decline in high-margin client fund interest revenues due to lower interest rates. The strong pretax margin expansion in both Employer Services and in Dealer Services was driven primarily by operating leverage. The lower level of new business bookings for Employer Services resulted in slower growth in sales cost, which benefited the Employer Services margin this quarter, but is anticipated to turn around as the fiscal year progresses. As Carlos mentioned, we are confirming our full year new bookings forecast. In achieving this bookings forecast, we anticipate that next quarter's sales expense will grow faster and, therefore, not contribute to the pretax margin expansion at the same level as we saw this quarter. The success achieved by our in-house sales organization is another area of positive contribution to pretax margin expansion. We are seeing the benefit from their use of online tools to drive efficiency and to better partnering with our feet-on-the-street sales force. And before we leave the discussion on the quarter's results, I want to point out that the decline in client interest revenues resulting from low interest rates continues to be the most significant drag on ADP's result. As anticipated, ADP's revenue growth was muted, nearly 1 percentage point as the lower yield more than offset the benefit from the 8% growth in balances. Pretax margin was negatively impacted by 110 basis points, and diluted earnings per share was lower by 3% or 5 percentage points for the quarter -- by $0.03, I apologize, or 5 percentage points for the quarter. Excluding this impact, it is evident that the leverage in ADP's business model is strong and intact. The important takeaway I want to leave you with related to the client fund investment strategy is that we believe the bottom of the cycle in terms of size of the year-over-year decline was last fiscal year and the worst is behind us. Now looking ahead for the year, I am pleased to reaffirm our initial financial 2014 guidance that we provided to you on August 1. And before we take your questions, I want to remind you that ADP has continued its shareholder-friendly actions. We've repurchased 4.2 million ADP shares in the quarter for a total cost of $303 million. I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from the line of Paul Thomas with Goldman Sachs. Paul B. Thomas - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I guess, I'm starting off on the new sales growth. Was any hesitation related to the government shut down? At least, in magnitude, the drop looks similar to what we saw last year ahead of the fiscal cliff. And any update on new sales 1 month into the December quarter? Carlos A. Rodriguez: I think that when you think about the timing of when the shutdown took place, it doesn't feel like it was a major factor. I think we believe that a bigger factor was the very strong finish in the fourth quarter. When we look at our overall sales results, we had really good results that were in line with our expectations in every segment except for the upmarket, where there is a great deal more lumpiness, and we've -- this theme has been recurring for years if not decades at ADP, that it's when you have a very, very strong finish in a large market, it tends to drain the pipeline into the following quarter. So we believe that that was a -- the most significant factor was the strong finish in 2013, and then just poor execution on our part overall of not making sure that we have sufficient pipeline in going into the first quarter. We also had a difficult compare over last year's first quarter, so that also doesn't help. But I wouldn't ascribe a great deal of blame to the government shutdown, at least not on our sales results, perhaps on what you saw this morning with the employment report and maybe other factors, and our October results may have been affected by some chipping away of confidence or whatever you want to call it as a result of the government shutdown. But the quarter was basically done by the time the government shutdown issues really emerged. Paul B. Thomas - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And you spoke in the past about your new sales goals for the year, you expect to meet those roughly half from sales force productivity and half from headcount growth. The 4% increase in headcount you talked about, was that in reaction to the slow start of the year, or was that already part of your plan entering the fiscal year? Carlos A. Rodriguez: It's actually a great question. As I was reading it, I was wondering if someone would ask that question because it's a logical question, and no, we were just kind of reaffirming that we are -- we have a few other things that we're going to talk about that we're continuing to invest in on the sales cycle, like we're doing a lot of investment in search engine marketing and trying to increase the number of leads to our sales force. We're also investing in headcounts. So no, there was no -- that comment was really just to reaffirm that we're doing the same things we've always been doing, so you didn't get the impression that we had under-invested or that we were under-investing in sales. So that is in line with our plans, and we just wanted to make sure that we reaffirm that. Paul B. Thomas - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. One more from my end. On your innovation day, you highlighted some of the new document management and recruiting functions. And I just want to be clear on as part of the product refresh, were there any features added specifically for the reporting requirements of the Affordable Care Act? You talked a little bit about that in your prepared comments. Is there more to come or you're expecting those to be met with the features you already have? Jan Siegmund : No, there will be, through the reporting but also through workflow adjustments, specific use cases. They relate mostly to the management of part-time versus full-time employees and other enrollment actions in each of them. So the reporting will support, but there will be also these use cases that flow in workflow streams through the -- both the HCM applications. Carlos A. Rodriguez: We do have -- we have a dedicated group working on solutions to help with compliance of ACA. And we have had one thing that we already had that helped our clients just from a communications standpoint regarding ACA, but it didn't really require any technology. It was basically a communication to all employees about their coverage that was required as part of the ACA. Operator : Your next question is from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : This is Ashish Sabadra, calling on behalf of Bryan Keane. I just have a follow-up question on the sales bookings. So you highlighted that the bookings were strong in the small businesses, the weakness was mostly in the national accounts, I believe. How about the mid-market? If you could just provide some more color by different size, merchant sizes? And also going -- just to follow-up on that, going into your peak selling season, how do you feel about the competitive environment? And if you could just comment on that as well. Carlos A. Rodriguez: In terms of some additional color on sales, I think in the fourth quarter call, we talked about, again, just to reiterate, when we have, just voice of experience, when we have these strong finishes, and we really did have an exceptionally strong finish in the fourth quarter of '13, we always tend to struggle in terms of in the first quarter. So we had plans, and I think we signaled that in our last call that our sales growth, we don't disclose quarterly sales growth in terms of our plans, but I think we did signal that we expected the first quarter to be below the full year in terms of sales growth. And of course, that's what we've got. This was obviously even below what we expected, the 1%. We expect the weakness anyway. And so the rest of the business units outside of the upmarket basically delivered results in line with those expectations. So not in the strong double-digits because of the strong finish we had in 2013, but in, call it, the high-single digits, which we consider to be strong based on the backdrop of the strong finish in 2013. So really, the entire sales force performed as expected, and in our view, in a strong manner, except for the upmarket. In terms of going into the selling season, you heard us reaffirm our guidance. We believe we have the headcount, we believe we have the products, and we believe we need to execute in order to hit those numbers. So we don't -- at least right now, it's too early for us to say that we either can't make it or that we're going to exceed it. So that's why we kept the guidance the same in the 8% to 10% range. So I think that would tell you that we have not seen any material difference in the competitive environment, our ability to win, and we expect to have a very strong selling season. Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : And just a quick follow-up on pricing, have you changed any -- have you seen any change in pricing dynamics in the industry? Jan Siegmund : No, we have not seen any material change in the pricing dynamics in any of our markets. Operator : Your next question comes from George Mihalos from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Just to go back one final time on the new sales growth. Is there a way to think about the percentage of new sales that typically comes in through the first quarter as we go through the year? Carlos A. Rodriguez: I seriously doubt that would be the last question about sales, but we'll answer your question anyway. So Jan may be busily trying to find what that percentage is, but it's not 25% because our first quarter skew is typically lower than the third -- I'm sorry, than the second and the third quarters, so I'm confident that it is less than 25%, but I don't know the exact number. And so I think your math -- I think it's a fair question. I don't think it helps us that much. We still have a lot of work to do, so we'll have a lot of wood to chop to get back up to the 8% to 10% range. Because although it's true that the first quarter isn't as important as other quarters, it's -- we have big numbers. These are -- we have one -- I think our forecast for the year is over $1.4 billion in sales. So even if the first quarter is 20% and another quarter is 28% or 30%, it's still challenging. We have a lot of work to do. Jan Siegmund : We don't disclose our quarterly sales volumes, but the skewing is in a few percentage points, not in the double-digit changes. Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And then just a follow-up on Europe. I think you said that pays per control were down 0.8%. I think that was largely in line with what you saw last quarter, if I'm not mistaken. Do you think that Europe in aggregate is starting to bottom? Jan Siegmund : This is a question that I also discussed at length with the team. I was, last couple of weeks ago, in Europe, and I'm trying to sniff out if we see the early signs of that recovery, and it's really exactly the same number that we had in the last quarter. Notionally, we would feel it should have bottomed out and we want to see slight improvements. But -- and that's kind of what the gut feel tells you and me, but the numbers are really exactly what we expected and we have not seen an upshift. But it's almost smelling that there could spring in the air, but we have not seen it in the numbers. It continues to be that Southern Europe is struggling, and that's where most of the challenges are, and then the core countries feel like that they're kind of at the verge of getting better. Operator : Your next question is from Sara Gubins with Bank of America. Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I'll start off with an HCM question. How do you think employers are thinking about switching HCM providers as opposed to upgrading systems? And I'm wondering, because there's been some research that suggested that there would be more interest in replacement as opposed to upgrades now versus in the past, and I'm kind of wondering what you think about that and what it could mean for ADP. Carlos A. Rodriguez: We've seen, I think, a lot of different research that comes to -- everybody has different conclusions depending on who funds the research, that's why we prefer independent research. The -- I think there's no question that the changes in technologies infrastructure around cloud have created a potential opening for people to reconsider and think, not just for HCM, but other parts of their business, how they use technology and whether they want to make those infrastructure investments themselves or they want to have them reside in someone else's backyard. And so, I think it is possible that the acceptance and the growth of cloud-based solutions across multiple industries will create a greater propensity or more openness towards potentially switching versus simply just upgrading, so that's a possibility. We believe that we would be beneficiaries of that because at the end of the day, we are kind of the ultimate cloud provider and have always kind of provided our clients on a hosted basis, if you will, on an outsourced basis. So I think the willingness of people to rethink how they do things and willingness to outsource more around their infrastructure in the cloud, I think, is something that we hope will benefit us. Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Great. And then a question on RUN and EasyPay. Is the overall count of clients, when you combine RUN and EasyPay, going up? And given the shift of the pace towards RUN, do you think it will still take about 18 months to get everybody on RUN or could that actually happen faster? And if it does, if you could talk about the cost benefit of maybe not having to run EasyPay, that would be great. Carlos A. Rodriguez: Yes. The combination of EasyPay and RUN, our unit growth is in the 4% to 5% range year-over-year, which is quite strong. I'm looking for a fact check on that, but it's in the 4% to 5% range, which obviously we're extremely pleased with that because it does feel like we're gaining market share and, certainly, doing well against the competition in that space. So we are selling very little EasyPay now, so obviously, it's just a combination of what we're selling and what we have on RUN and then what is attriting, if you will, on EasyPay. But to answer your question if you combine those 2 is that we have very good growth in that part of our business. And as we disclosed our unit growth numbers overall for ADP, it is important to remember that, because of the skewing of how many clients we have in that space, which is over 400,000, it does tend to skew the growth number. In other words, i.e. most of the growth for units for us is taking place in that space, in the combination of RUN and EasyPay. And I'm sorry, the second part of your question was? Jan Siegmund : On migration. Carlos A. Rodriguez: On migration. How could I forget? That was one of my favorite topics. So we're having some internal discussions, if you will. I would almost call them fun, if they weren't so serious about how fast we can get off of EasyPay. Because we do think that it has a value financially for us, which is I think the nature of your question, but it has also much more value for us symbolically, right, in terms of our push to just overall focus more on migrations not just in small business, but really across all of ADP. So this concept of really simplifying our platforms and migrating clients is a big deal for us internally. We don't talk about it a lot externally, but we do have a lot of focus on it. So as of right now, I have a discussion last week with the leader of that business, Anish, who is -- they're working very, very hard on bringing that 18-month time horizon in closer to 12 to 15 months. But we also don't want to obviously leave clients to the competition. And so we want to make sure that we migrate those clients in an orderly fashion and that we consider what their needs are and that we make sure that we have the right level of support and service for them when we bring them onto RUN. So I would say that the short answer to your question is that 18 months at the longest, and I'm hoping that it is shorter than that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore. David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Carlos, you addressed the migration timeline from EasyPay to RUN, but could you also give us an update on the timeline to Workforce Now? Carlos A. Rodriguez: I know Jan is going to give you some of the specifics. But again, anecdotally, I also happen to speak with the other -- the leader of that business, Regina, last week as well, and very, very pleased with the progress in our mid-market in terms of client migrations as well there. So heard some -- seen some really great results in terms of some older versions, if you will, of Workforce Now, our previous platform, PCPW, and another one, Pay eXpert, that have been -- a couple of which have been retired. So we still have work to do to get all of our mid-market clients onto Workforce Now. But I think it's another place where I think we're ahead of our plans, and I'm really pleased with the focus of the organization and the pace that we're going. So I don't know, Jan, if you have... Jan Siegmund : No, I believe we have approximately 15,000 clients left on PCPW. And both in RUN, for the first quarter, as well as for PCPW, we're ahead of our plans. So the migration teams are working well, and migration's accelerating in pace basically overall. So that gives us that comfort that the timeframe is -- the range that we gave you is probably more comfort towards the earlier than the later finish at this point in time. Carlos A. Rodriguez: And we're very -- part of the strategy behind migration is first of all, it's the right to do because the clients should be on our best platforms because we believe they really help them run their businesses. But it also, as a side benefit, reduces the size of the pond in which our competitors fish. So we believe that head-to-head competition, our platforms today sell very well and compete very well, and we need to really get those clients on those platforms to really keep the competition from getting to them first. David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Second question. If we add back the impact from lower interest rates on your earnings, it looks like you would have posted 15% earnings per share growth x the lower interest rate, which is a rate of earnings growth I don't think we've seen since before the financial crisis. And even then, you still have the brokerage business, at least up until about a year before the financial crisis. So more of a longer-term question, based on the results you've recently seen and some of the new products that you've introduced, is it possible we could be looking at a higher earnings growth rate than we've seen historically once we get past the negative impact from lower interest rate on slowed income? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Let me start answering the question by focusing on revenues. Some of the times that you're mentioning in terms of periods back where we had slower earnings growth, we also had lower revenue growth. And so our model really does benefit quite a lot from a margin and profitability standpoint when we can accelerate revenues, which is why we've been so focused on this concept of net new business and the difference between sales, or the business we start versus the business that we lose. In the last 2 or 3 years, we've gotten decent traction in terms of that net new business contributing to our revenue growth. So when you combine that with pays per control growth and a little bit of price increase, we're getting, as you can see, into the 7% to 8% growth range, revenue-wise, and that's with the 1% drag from interest income. Because interest income doesn't only drag the bottom line, but because of the way we report interest revenue, because it's part of our core business, it also affects our revenue growth. So getting solidly into the 8% to 10% revenue growth range really provides us with a lot of opportunity to drive margin improvement, and also to invest in the business, whether it's in some of our technology and product or in the sales force. And so we feel extremely good about the progress on margins in the quarter. I think your statement was accurate, but I just want to make sure that I added context in terms of 2 or 3 years ago, it would have been hard to generate the kind of earnings growth that we just delivered this quarter just because the revenue growth wasn't there. And some of that was the backdrop of the economy coming out of a difficult recession in terms of sales and losses and so forth. So we had the benefit, I think, of the economy recovering. I think we've had good execution from sales with 2 years now of double-digit sales growth. And I think we're really getting that top line revenue growth that allows us -- provides us a lot of flexibility in terms of generating resources both to give back to shareholders in the form of earnings growth, but also to reinvest in the business. So I'm not going to get into the math. The math that you, I think, laid out is accurate, and it is the math. Jan Siegmund : Maybe to be the conservative CFO for a tiny bit, David, consider also that we had slight help on the NFE because of our weaker sales results in the quarter that helped a little bit. Not much, actually, not as much as the degree we talked about in the fourth quarter. But -- so there's a little bit of quarter-specific items in here that make the margin expansion really nice for the quarter. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Can you just remind us where you delineate in terms of number of employees between small, mid and large enterprise? I don't know if that's changed at all. I feel like we haven't discussed that in a while. Carlos A. Rodriguez: It's actually a great question because we're trying to delineate less and less in the sense that, again, I think we said this in a couple of calls and it's worth reiterating, that we are selling our platforms across market segments. And so the bright lines that we had 5, 10 years ago, I think, are fading for the right reasons because those bright lines are not market-oriented. And so as an example, we sell our RUN platform into the mid-market and we sell Workforce Now into the national accounts market. But to give you specifics on the answer to your question, internally, we have a business leader responsible for 0 to 50 employees. We have another business leader responsible for 50 to 999 or to 1,000. And then above 1,000, we have a different business leader, and we consider that to be national accounts or upmarket. But all these leaders are part of the same team. They're part of my team. And one of the things we've been focused on a lot in the last several years, and this goes back probably 3 or 4 years, is figuring out how we sell the right platforms to the right client, irrespective of the segment. And we've actually executed quite well against that in the sense that we're selling a lot of RUN into our major accounts segment and we're selling a lot of Workforce Now down into the small business market when it's a complex client or a client that has complex needs. And just this last quarter, we had really robust sales of Workforce Now in our national accounts space, where that platform is a good solution for many clients where the Vantage platform may not necessarily be the right fit. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay, understood. And just going back to your comments earlier around rebuilding the pipeline for the large enterprise. I mean, I just want to get a sense because I know the sale cycles are obviously long in that segment. So as you sit here with, I guess, what do we have, 8 months left in the fiscal year, I mean, is there enough time to rebuild the pipeline and then actually convert the pipeline into sales to make sure that you get to that 8% to 10%? Or do you think it's really just going to come down to how a few deals break either way in Q4? Carlos A. Rodriguez: It's actually both things. You're quite correct about the few deals breaking things. This is one of the things that's been -- this has been true for years, whether in GlobalView and in national accounts, a few deals do make a difference, particularly in 1 quarter. And so we probably need a couple of deals to break our way over the course of the next 8 months, and then we also need to rebuild that pipeline and close some of that business. And just remember that, for us, again from a revenue standpoint, we want to close the business and then get it started. And so right now, we are actually benefiting from all the strong sales we've had over the last couple of years, including the last quarter, and we need to kind of rebuild that. But from a revenue standpoint, it doesn't have a huge impact on us in the short term. This is all about getting the signature on the deal. We still have to then start the deal after that. So as we rebuild these pipelines and execute and close the business and get the sales, there's still a 6- to 12-month lag for that business to become revenue. So I know you all know that, but I just want to kind of put that reminder out. But you heard our guidance. We believe that we can rebuild those pipelines, we can get enough business closed to help us get to that 8% to 10%. But I think you also hear us being somewhat cautious in the sense that we would have preferred to have ended up in the mid single-digits growth for the quarter in sales and not low single-digits. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Yes, that's fair. And just last question for me. You made a brief reference to the national employment report you guys put out this morning. And it looked like the job number was somewhat below consensus. I think it's declined for 4 straight months or so now. I mean, is this turning into a potential pattern that we should be concerned at all about in terms of possibly reversing the trend of improving U.S. employment that we had been witnessing for a while? Carlos A. Rodriguez: I think when you listen to the economist Mark Zandi, who really helps and kind of has the real data behind the numbers that we report, we do believe, in this case, unlike in our sales results, that the government shutdown did have an impact. And so, if you listen to him this morning describe kind of where he is, he believes that that number probably had a 20,000 to 30,000 impact, if you will, from the government shutdown. But even excluding that, that gets you back to, call it around 150,000, which is really below the trend back 6 months ago. So when I look at these numbers, I try to look at more than just 1 month. And if you look at, excluding October, the previous 2 quarters, the last quarter was down sequentially about 20,000 per month on average than the previous quarter. So the trend was definitely down, but it feels like 150,000 is where Zandi would say we are right now, which is not where we were before at 170,000 or 190,000. But right now, it doesn't seem like it's the number that's -- there is no clear indication yet that, that's going to break even lower than that kind of 150,000 trend. Because this month had some noise in it because of the government shutdown. Operator : The next question is from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research : Carlos, as you look at the payroll business, do you see competition changing at all, especially now that you have more cloud-based products? Is that allowing others to maybe enter the industry that you didn't see previously? Carlos A. Rodriguez: I mean, I think that we've had a lot of competition forever. So as long as I've been around at ADP and I, obviously, have the benefit of talking to a lot of people who've been around even longer than I have. So we have had a lot of good competitors for a very long time, there's been multiple changes in technology. And so we've been around, as you know, more than 60 years. And so we have gone all the way from punch cards to PCs to the cloud, and we've had competition all along the way, that's just the nature of the beast both in the U.S. and globally. But I think, as Jan said, we haven't seen any indications yet from a pricing standpoint that there's any issues around pricing. And in terms of the amount of competition or the fierceness, if you will, of the competition, I think our sales results, notwithstanding the first quarter, speak for themselves. We had 2 very, very strong years, even the year before that, we just missed being double digits. So we have almost 3 years of double-digit sales growth and 2 years of solid double-digits sales growth. And I think that is the best indication of all of kind of your competitive position, whether you're winning market share or whether you're not winning market share. And we feel pretty good about our position and the pivots we've made to really address the changes in technology around cloud. So we feel comfortable where we are, but we understand very well more than anyone else that there's a lot of competition, because everyone is obviously aiming at us, and we have lots of people to aim at. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research : And then just to go back on your comment, you said you see less delineation in your customer segments. Is that the result of just all your customers wanting technology or almost the same level of technology? Is that the primary reason, or are there other reasons for your comment? Carlos A. Rodriguez: I think, frankly, the reason for my comment was really more around internal issues around the blurring of our silos and our segments. We've been -- again, my observation of my tenure at ADP is that we've made a lot of progress now on being able to focus on the client and not on the business unit leader, and that their specific segment is their responsibility. So I think we've worked really hard over the last 5 to 10 years to blur those lines, and I think it helps us because it makes it harder for the competition, and I think it gets the clients the right solutions that they need to get the job done. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Carlos, you talked about the addition to headcount on the sales force side being up about 4% this year. Can you remind us how that compares to prior years? And I'm also curious, has that already happened this year or is it going to be more kind of smooth throughout the entire year this year? Carlos A. Rodriguez: I think that that is pretty close to last year's headcount growth because we had, obviously, very strong sales results. And so we had more than double, if you will, the number of headcount growth from a productivity standpoint, which we're very pleased by, but we haven't planned on and we weren't counting on. And we're certainly not counting on for this year. So last year, we had around the same headcount growth, but had just some amazing productivity gains that ended up giving us double-digit results at the end of the year. I believe our plan for this year is to be around that 4%. And I think right now, we are in that range, around 4%. Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay, great. And then I'm shifting back to the bookings number, I'm sorry about this. But you've talked about past experience having a strong fourth quarter and then potentially a softer first quarter. How long does it take to get back to a more normalized trend? Will we see it in the second quarter or it will be more back-end loaded? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Sorry. Could you repeat the question one more time? We're checking on your headcount growth number, which is 4% this year and I'm just looking at last year was 3%. Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay, great. That's helpful. My question was on bookings. You mentioned the strong fourth quarter leading to the softer first quarter. I'm just curious, historically, how that -- how long it takes to get back to normal. Will we see it bounce back in the second quarter or it would be more gradual throughout the year? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Well, I think, unfortunately, there's more moving parts in terms of the comparison to the previous second quarter also matters. So last year's second quarter versus this second quarter will have some impact as well. As you can imagine, there are potential, other moving parts like -- we're not seeing anything yet in our sales results. But the government shutdown, and the hit to confidence, if you will, or people delaying decisions could have had an impact on our results in the October or in the second quarter. So there's a lot of other moving parts in terms of how quickly that number comes back. The real key to focus on is the pipeline, is do you have the headcount and do you have the pipeline. And we believe we do. Notwithstanding that, there will be noise along the way, whether it's fiscal cliffs or government shutdowns or other factors, strong fourth quarters and strong compares or difficult compares. So all those things are factors. But fundamentally, you have to have the headcount and you have to have the pipeline. And those are the numbers that Jan and I spent some time looking at. And that's why we believe that we can reaffirm our guidance. Operator : The next question is from Mark Marcon with Robert W. Baird. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : One more just on the bookings side. When I was over at HR Tech, it looked like there've been some nice product improvements in terms of Vantage, and it sounds like the number of clients on that has been growing. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing there? You did mention that the bookings were softer on the upper end of the market. What are you seeing in terms of the win rates that are currently going in terms of the actual engagements that you're going through or the RFPs that you're going through at this point? And is it more a question of pipeline build as opposed to improving win rates? Carlos A. Rodriguez: I think that in the upmarket for us, besides Vantage, just to be clear, the Vantage sales themselves are one, frankly, relatively small part of the overall sales results in the upmarket. So in addition to Vantage, we have our multinational sales, which were, I think, weak could be an understatement for the first quarter because we had none in GlobalView. We usually don't disclose that, but we -- that's a very, very lumpy business. So whether or not you get 1 or 2 deals in a quarter in GlobalView is very normal. So sometimes, we'll have 2 or 3 in a quarter and they help us a lot, and this quarter we had none, so that hurt us in terms of that growth rate in the upmarket. We also have our upmarket BPO solution in those results, which also tends to be a very large sales number when we sell those, what we call COS deals. And this quarter also happen to be weak from an upmarket BPO standpoint. By the way, we had a very strong year and a very strong fourth quarter in BPO, so there is no -- I don't think there's any negative news to report there other than the pipeline having been emptied. And then you come back to we have a lot of other products that we sell in our national accounts space in addition to Vantage such as standalone benefit solutions and other solutions for the benefit space. And unfortunately, it was weak across-the-board, but it really wasn't a Vantage issue. Vantage is still selling well. We had a good first quarter in terms of the number of new clients that we sold. We actually increased our starts by 50%, so we have -- we've doubled the number of clients that we have actually already -- that actually started, not just sold, in Vantage. So we really don't -- it's not really an issue of Vantage, singling out Vantage as a problem for the quarter. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Great. So it sounds like it's a little bit broader based, but just in terms of the general question in terms of pipeline versus win rates, was there any change in terms of the win rates and in terms of the ERPs that went through? Jan Siegmund : No. Number one, of course, the deal volume was a little bit lower overall, so it's a little bit -- probably not a material change. Now we're talking here statistical numbers on percentage rates switch one way or the other, but nothing that has changed really relating to the competitiveness of Vantage that we can see. Carlos A. Rodriguez: I think some of it is just the nature of the large account market in terms of the lumpiness as part of it. And I think we believe also we have some execution issues, where I think we have -- all of us put an enormous amount of pressure on each other to make sure that we get the sales results every quarter. But there's also an expectation as from a leadership standpoint that you maintain your platforms that you have, for the next quarter and the quarter after that. And we dropped the ball and we didn't execute, I think, is at the end of the day part of the challenge. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Great. And then with regards to the migration, I didn't get the migration schedule for both RUN and for Workplace. Can you talk a little bit more about -- I mean for Workforce. Can you talk a little bit about how we should think about that, and then what the implications would be for the margins? Jan Siegmund : Yes. We talked, I think, in the last fiscal year, RUN, we migrated approximately 24,000 RUN clients over. And about half of them were migrated in the last quarter. So we had a very steep ramping of the migration pace. And now, in the first quarter, migrations accelerated another 50% above that rate in the last quarter. So we're still ramping, although that's not going to continue; it's going to level at some point in time. So we're getting close to that level that we anticipated is good and sustainable, but we have still a rapid acceleration and pace for migrations in this quarter, it seems. So we want to get out of this accounting for the quarter here, but the general guidance that within -- now we have quarter, we said 18 months. So the game here is really how fast in fiscal '15 are we going to be off the platform or not. And as Carlos indicated, that's moving more towards the beginning of FY '15 than the end of it, if you want guidance. So the pace of migrations in RUN is really nice and ahead of our plan and scaling well and so forth. The same thing in Workforce Now, we increased the number of migrations quarter-over-quarter, but they kind of have the teams going, they go fairly stable. Last year, we migrated approximately 10,000 clients. Now I said we have about 15,000 clients, I think, at PCPW. So clearly now, we're going to come into more tricky client situations, clients that were highly satisfied with the PCPW environment and so forth, and we want to treat them right. So as you get a smaller base to convert, there could be slowing in pace, more indicating just that the bowl to fish in is getting smaller. But same thing, the Workforce Now team is really doing a great job and they finished also ahead of their goals for the quarter. Carlos A. Rodriguez: I think just in terms of, again, general dates, I think, we think that RUN may be able to get done in -- earlier in calendar '15 than what we previously anticipated because we, I think, previously thought it would take us kind of towards the middle of calendar '15. We think we can pull that in a little sooner. And I think Workforce Now and PCPW migrations are probably somewhere in the same time frame. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Great. And can you talk -- I know you're going to continue to invest for innovation, but can you talk about just the -- what that would free up in terms of funds to invest for innovation? Carlos A. Rodriguez: I don't know that we have that level of detail to be able to share yet. I think it's a fair question as we get closer to the time and we're able to quantify more the numbers. Because the pure R&D dollars, for example, that we spent on EasyPay, that alone is nothing to write home about, frankly. And it's -- we'll take it, and we'll reinvest it in innovation. But I think there are ancillary costs related to friction around having multiple platforms, around having multiple service people, multiple implementation methodology. So I think it is broader than just the R&D. And so I think it's fair to do for us because we're doing some of it internally. But I think finding a way to communicate with all of you what we think might be the outcomes of that, I think, is a fair question. So we'll work on that, but it's not as simple as just the R&D cost because we know what those dollars are, but we think it's a broader benefit to us. Jan Siegmund : As we have stated before, I think the increased focus on innovation will result effectively, but at this point, we are aiming to keep the ratio of R&D spend relative to revenue growth in line. So that's the area that we're not planning to scale significantly. Within that R&D budget, we fund portfolio of initiatives and innovation that we allocate, so this will give us effectively more room to invest into our strategic platforms, accelerate the pace of innovation, to make even further difference for our product. And then the operational scale that the reduction of complexity would yield will, in my point of view, support our general guidance of gaining operational leverage that we need to and want to provide to our shareholders, as we have done successfully in this quarter in particular. So if you think about it, those are the by [ph] part of our plans for the long run, to feel comfortable that the operational scale will be maintained at a good pace. Operator : Your next question is from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Just a couple of follow-up questions. First on the ES margins. Obviously, really nice, 160 basis points year-over-year. And I think you sort of called out partly the benefit of the lower sales commissions, you're sort of tied to the bookings trends we've all been talking about. Is there any way to sort of quantify directionally how much the margin benefit year-over-year was from the lower than kind of expected sales commissions? And I think you sort of were suggesting that that could conversely be a drag into 2Q. And just kind of like looking at your sales comparison, it looks like 2Q is your easiest comp of the year. So it kind of implies that you should see a nice acceleration in bookings into 2Q. So there's kind of 2 questions there. Jan Siegmund : All right, that's 2 quick questions. The -- I'll take the margin question. It's less than 50 basis points on the ES margins that helped, so it's less than $0.01 and so forth, so it's really smaller on the sales cost line. But it did help us a little bit. In the second quarter compare, I think you're an astute observer that the second quarter last year was hampered by Sandy impact and also another government friction that we experienced, which gave us that quarter. So your observance is correct, but we're not even closing October yet. We're just in the process of closing October. So yes, that will be our quarter that we have to grow over. Carlos A. Rodriguez: And if I can just add. So I think, as Jan described, the margin issue, I just want to make sure that it does not come easily, the margin improvement. So I just want to compliment our field operations groups who were able to kind of deliver this kind of -- there's been a lot of hard work around, driving productivity and efficiency in the field to basically deliver the results we want to deliver to all of you, but also to be able to reinvest in the business. And they certainly have come through in the first quarter, and we expect that they're going to continue to come through. And so I just want to make sure that I got that out here. This does not come easily because your observation is correct, that it was -- that's an impressive margin improvement. And even backing out the benefit of lower sales cost, it's still pretty impressive. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then a little bit different direction. The RUN product, obviously, has been -- you continue to put up good numbers there, good unit growth, and it seems to me gaining nice market share at that end of the market, and maybe just sort of color or commentary on that, I don't know, I doubt you'd have any specifics on it. But is there any way to sort of think about the market share you gained, you've had with RUN since you've rolled it out? Carlos A. Rodriguez: It feels -- again, back to the research, if you look at research reports, and you look at the growth of the market itself, new business formations, there's a bunch of things you could look at that would lead you to believe that we're gaining some market share. But those numbers are so big and so squishy in terms of the range of error in terms of like every time I look at some of these numbers, it makes me uncomfortable. The only thing that I want to see is for us to continue to grow. And it feels great when it feels like we're gaining market share, but we need to focus on ourselves and we obviously need to focus on what the competition is doing to win. But this is about us, not about competitors. And we think we're doing well and we're executing, and that's where we're going to continue to focus on. Operator : And your final question is from David Grossman with Stifel. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : I jumped on a little bit late, so if any of this has been already asked and answered, we can take it offline. But the first thing I wanted to ask is just, could you give us some updated thoughts on the Affordable Care Act and what impact, if any, you're thinking it may have on the PEO business, whether that be positive or negative? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Yes, we had actually quite strong sales results in the PEO in this first quarter. And so, obviously, it doesn't seem like it's having an effect yet. We think that the position of the PEO is quite strong in terms of providing an alternative. Because when you really get down to it, the PEO is an exchange. It's a very large employer option for small companies. So we -- this is the way the business has always been managed and it's just the nature of the business that you're creating scale in what we call the PEO for small companies, not just for health care, but also for workers' compensation, for technology, for HR services, for a number of things. In other words, giving small companies things that typically are only accessible to large companies. And health care plans are in that category. So the quality of our health plans and the price of our health plans, we believe, has always been a differentiator for us in the marketplace. And we believe that's what's allowing us to be successful through what is now other options. So there are other options being created for individuals and for small companies as a result of the ACA. But we believe that the PEO is one of those options, and it's very viable, and in fact, it's executing quite well and growing quite nicely. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then in terms of the alternatives and the alternative would be, at least on the health care side, right, the private exchanges that emerged. Any thoughts on how we should think about the scale of your business versus potentially what these other exchanges could look like? Or is it just too early to really kind of make that assessment? Carlos A. Rodriguez: I can give you a little bit of color in the sense that not every PEO will be the same in terms of how it handles the ACA changes. So as an example, our average wage, the pools of our clients tend to be more white-collar, higher average pay, greater participation and benefits and a greater percentage of contribution to those benefits by the employers themselves, by the small business clients that are part of our PEO. So that is a fundamentally important issue to keep in mind because, where there is potentially the biggest risk is from an exchange is where you have low average wage, low benefits participation and an exchange may provide a very attractive alternative. So this is not to say that it won't be an attractive alternative to some small business clients, but the types of small business clients that we target in our PEO, we don't believe will be immediately tempted to move to an exchange. Although some, I'm sure will. But we don't -- we believe that we have some advantage in dealing with the change because of the nature of the types of clients that we attract and that we actually have in our PEO. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Okay, got it. And then just a second question, just gets back to -- on the products side. Obviously, one of the great benefits of the new platform is the ability to sell a suite of different ADP products. And again, perhaps given where we are in the migration, it's a little early to kind of provide an update on some of the anecdotal data points that you provided in the past. But is there anything new you can share now that we're 3 or 4 months further into this? What the take rates look in terms of your ability to sell suite and how the sales force is gearing up to do that, the changes you've made to incent them to do that? Jan Siegmund : There are 2 questions. So in the migration, we mentioned in the past that we up-sell certain product components because clients learned about the product and immediately buy some more. And we have seen up-sell activity, I think I disclosed it's about 20% higher revenue in the migration that happens in Workforce Now as we do it. That's really where this is relevant. And we have not seen any change in that momentum. So we should anticipate that that continues. Those are new sales to us, only the 20% up-sell component that flows into our new business bookings, and it's reflected in the thing. So as migrations, too. That has been part of the last year's new business bookings numbers and will be this. So there's no change in that. I think that's now fairly stable on it. And secondly, selling of bundled solutions, the attach rates remain very high in Vantage on the deals that we have sold. No change, really, to the rates that we have reported back, slight, slight error of statistics here and there, but they're really essentially the same. So I think we have -- we are delighted with the high attach rates that our upmarket products achieved and the up-sell opportunity that we had in Workforce Now. The incentives have been the same. Our sales force gets only incented on generating new return revenue that has been historic model for ADP and we didn't have to change that for this process. So the incentive structure is supportive of the overall strategy. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos A. Rodriguez: Great. Thank you, all, for joining us today. As you could tell, we're very pleased with our results. We continue to do the right things from a shareholder standpoint, paying our dividends, executing our share buybacks when the market allows. You've heard a lot of our discussion and our focus on innovation, which I think you're going to continue to hear about. I think that it's really developing a set of products where we have, I think, offerings that are both deep, but also broad in terms of back to this issue around attach rates and the number of additional platforms that we sell along with our payroll solutions. So all of that, I think, is better positioning us to meet the needs of our clients and actually around the entire globe, not just in the U.S. And so we look forward to sharing more of these thoughts with you about our HCM strategy in future calls. And we thank you, again, for joining us today. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

Inc., Research Division Operator : Good morning. My name is Victoria, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Second Quarter Fiscal 2014 Earnings Webcast. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Ms. Elena Charles, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Elena Charles : Thank you, and good morning. I'm here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter fiscal 2014 earnings call and webcast. As a reminder, the quarterly history of revenue and pretax earnings for our reportable segments is also available in the Investor Relations portion of our website. Please be aware that we recently launched an updated Investor Relations website accessible at adp.com. Current quarter results, as well as the reportable segment schedules, can be found in the financial section of the new website and have been updated to include the second quarter of fiscal 2014. I'd like to remind everyone that during today's conference call, we will make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, as such, involve some risks, and these are discussed in our earnings release and in our periodic filings with the SEC. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Carlos for his opening remarks. Carlos A. Rodriguez: Thank you, Elena. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. There are a couple of things I'd like to cover today. First, I'll provide you perspective on our strategic initiatives to help you understand the strides we are making to drive our future growth. Second, I'll give you my thoughts on our results for the quarter. Then, Jan will take you through the details of the second quarter financial results and guidance for the year. After Jan's commentary, we'll be happy to take your questions. Before I give you an update on the business, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on calendar year 2013. I have some interesting statistics that remind me of how ADP solutions make a difference for our clients. For example, our solutions enabled more than 15 million employees and their dependents to enroll in medical benefits here in the U.S. for the 2014 benefits year. In addition, our Tax Credit Services clients realized about $1 billion in tax credits and, of course, in recent weeks, ADP produced more than 50 million year-end tax statements for our clients' employees: W2s in the U.S., as we know them, and T4s in Canada. Our ability to help clients succeed is based on our Human Capital Management strategy, or HCM, as it's known in the industry. Deeply rooted in our culture and before the term cloud was part of anyone's vocabulary, ADP's one-to-many solutions offered clients the benefit of an application hosted in a secure, remote data center. By having cloud-based solutions embedded early on in our innovation culture, ADP is able to say that today more than 360,000 client companies are using ADP cloud-based solution, a number that grows with each new client and migration. However, what differentiates ADP from pure software and technology offerings is our ability to provide fully outsourced service solutions along with comprehensive technology. Our solutions span the full HCM life cycle, from the early recruitment of prospective employees through employee retirement, ADP provides organizations of all sizes and the human resources professional with a proven service model, strong history of compliance management and insightful expertise from our decades of experience in the industry, an industry that ADP had a large part in creating and shaping. We continue to execute against our HCM strategy, emphasizing innovative cloud-based solutions, complementing technology with compliance and service. As we continue to expand the functionality of our integrated platforms and focus on stellar service, migrating clients to our newest platforms remains an important initiative. I'm pleased to report that migrations to ADP RUN are progressing well. We migrated about 25,000 clients during the quarter, and now have about 315,000 clients on this platform. We expect to be complete with all small business migrations in fiscal 2015. In addition to ADP RUN migrations, we are also executing on our plan to move all our midsized clients to ADP Workforce Now. We currently have more than 45,000 clients on this platform and expect to complete these migrations in fiscal 2015 as well. These migrations are an important part of our growth strategy as they allow for up-sell opportunities. As you may already know, just about half of the clients we migrate to Workforce Now from a standalone payroll platform sign up for one or more additional solutions such as time and attendance, HR and benefits administration or talent. Overall, we are executing well on our migration strategy and our new platform is providing more streamlined, integrated experience for our clients, as well as a better service experience. Another important item to touch on is the level of product integration ADP offers. ADP sits at the intersection of benefits administration, payroll and time and attendance. Within this intersection, human resources professionals manage regulatory requirements, such as the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, and other compliance issues. Having an integrated solution is essential to helping our clients minimize compliance risks. For instance, we recently introduced additional innovative tools and resources to help our ADP RUN platform -- to our ADP RUN platform that allow our small business clients to comply with ACA. Among them, the new simple-to-use full-time-equivalent calculator is essential in helping employers determine their status under the ACA's shared responsibility provisions. As the regulatory environment becomes even more complex, be it as a result of ACA or other compliance matters, our clients take comfort in knowing that we have helped businesses manage all kinds of change for more than 6 decades. When you combine our expertise in compliance matters with our service strength and innovative HCM solutions, you get a powerful platform that is second to none. Before we turn to the quarter's results, you may be interested to know that we held our annual meeting called ReThink in Paris this year. This is a great networking event, where ADP management and multinational clients and prospects have the opportunity to exchange ideas and discuss global HR needs. We are quite pleased with the high level of interest in our multinational service offerings. And now for the quarter results. ADP reported strong revenue growth of 9%, 8% organic, driven by solid starts of previously sold business. New business bookings growth for the quarter in Employer Services and PEO was 7%. Our momentum of bookings growth increased from the first quarter, but we are still behind our expectations for the first half of the fiscal year. I'm pleased that bookings growth in the U.S. in both the small and midmarkets were quite strong, which we believe is a testament to the strength of our RUN and Workforce Now offerings. Additionally, we saw strength in bookings growth from the PEO, in large part because ADP's value proposition in compliance surrounding the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, is resonating with small employers. Moving upmarket. As we discussed on our last call, we are rebuilding the pipeline in the U.S., which was drained as a result of the strong fiscal '13 fourth quarter. Our bookings results in this space were better than in the first quarter but are still behind our expectations in terms of closed contracts. In the multinational space, we closed 3 GlobalView deals during the quarter, and as you can probably tell from my earlier comments about the success of our meeting in Paris, the pipeline is solid. However, given where we are in the first half of the year, it will be difficult to make up enough of the shortfall to obtain the high end of our 8% to 10% forecast range. As a result, we are now expecting new business bookings growth to finish at approximately 8% for the year, which is the low end of our previous guidance range despite expectations for a strong second half. Now switching to the PEO. We continue to see positive momentum in this business. As I mentioned a moment ago, new business bookings were strong and growth in average worksite employees paid was a strong 12% for the quarter. Moving on to Dealer Services. The global outlook for the automotive industry continues to be positive. While we still see softness in Continental Europe, U.S. auto sales continue to advance towards pre-recessionary levels. Dealer Services performed well in the quarter as they continue to grow their client base through strong, competitive win rates while also benefiting from increased transactions in the U.S. I recently attended the NADA conference in New Orleans with the Dealer Services team. Organized by the National Automobile Dealers Association, it is the largest automotive trade show in North America, with thousands of attendees representing manufacturers, dealers and suppliers. We showcased a number of our product innovations that were very well received by our clients and prospects. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jan for a look at the quarter's financial highlights and the full-year forecast. Jan Siegmund : Thank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. ADP delivered strong revenue growth of 9% for the quarter. 8% of this growth was organic and included certain nonrecurring items that I will discuss in a moment. Focusing on continuing operations, we achieved 6% pretax earnings growth, 7% net earnings growth on a lower effective tax rate and 8% EPS growth on fewer shares outstanding compared with the year ago. The quarter's results were solid, with each of our business segments performing well. Employer Services grew total revenues 9%, the PEO grew 14% and Dealer Services grew 7%. In Employer Services, I'm happy that overall our revenue growth has been widespread, with the small business market contributing particularly well. We are quite pleased with this strong revenue growth, but I do want to point out that this growth benefited about a point from certain items where the year-over-year comparables were easier this quarter and become more difficult in the second half of the year. For example, you have heard us talk about the revenues we received from administering certain employee tax credits for our clients here in the U.S. As these tax credit programs expire, they are not always immediately replaced with new programs, which creates lumpiness in quarterly revenue growth. We had such -- one such program that began last year's fiscal third quarter, and now that program has expired. We are pleased to see continued growth and strength in our same-store pays per control in Employer Services in the U.S., with an increase of 2.9%. However, in Europe, the same-store pays per control declined by 0.7%, as anticipated. Although the economic situation in Europe has stabilized, we have not seen a meaningful improvement. Average client fund balances were strong during the quarter, increasing 9%, driven by growth in standalone tax filings, an increase from new business growth, especially in the small business services, as well as increased pays per control. The PEO had a strong quarter, with 14% revenue growth, driven by 12% average worksite employee growth. Second quarter new business bookings were strong in the PEO, and, as Carlos mentioned, small and midsized businesses look to be in compliance with the ACA were the primary drivers of this growth. Moving on to Dealer Services. Revenue growth of 7% benefited from strong transaction revenues and was driven by new businesses installed, improved client retention and digital advertising. ADP's total pretax earnings and margin were impacted by the following : the negative impact from the decline in high-margin client fund interest revenues due to lower interest rates; and there was also a higher level of expenses outside the business segments of about $20 million to $25 million, primarily relating to higher stock compensation expense as a result of the higher share price, as well as certain severance charges recorded in the quarter. Also, as you may have seen in this morning's earnings release, we had an increase of 12% in our systems development and programming expense, which is ahead of our revenue growth. This increase is a result of our continued focus on innovation. On the positive note, I would like to point out that Employer Services posted strong pretax margin expansion year-over-year, primarily driven by increased operating efficiencies. Expenses related through the second quarter new business bookings increased compared to the first quarter as anticipated from the acceleration in new bookings growth, but I'm pleased that the expenses increased at a slower rate compared with revenue growth. And before we leave the discussion on the quarter's results, I want to point out that the decline in client interest revenues resulting from low interest rates continues to be the most significant drag on ADP's results. As anticipated, ADP's revenue growth was muted about half of a percentage point as the lower yield more than offset the benefit from the 9% growth in balances. Pretax margin was negatively impacted 90 basis points, and diluted earnings per share were lower by $0.02, or 3 percentage points, for the quarter. Excluding this impact, it is evident that the leverage in ADP's business model is strong and intact. Now I will give you our full-year forecast, which we have updated to reflect the solid results achieved during the first half of the fiscal year. We are now anticipating revenue growth of about 7% to 8% for a total ADP. I want to make -- I want to take a moment and remind you that although ADP's revenue growth was 8% for the first half of the year, we're anticipating some tougher comps in the second half, as I mentioned a few moments ago. We anticipate slight pretax margin improvement for a total ADP from 18.8% last year, which excludes the goodwill impairment charge we recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. We expect the effective tax rate will be about flat with fiscal year 2013's effective tax rate of 33.9%. I want to point out that although the full year effective tax rate forecast is unchanged, the year-to-date effective tax rate is 33.3%, which means that the effective tax rate during the second half of the year will be higher. We anticipate 8% to 10% growth in diluted earnings per share compared with $2.89 in fiscal year 2013, which excluded the goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. As is it our normal practice, no further share buybacks are contemplated in the forecast beyond anticipated dilutions related to employee equity comp plans, although it's clearly our intent to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders depending, obviously, on market conditions. And now for the segments. In Employer Services, we continue to forecast revenue growth of about 7%, but we believe we will now attain pretax margin expansion of about 100 basis points. Consistent with our prior forecast, we're still anticipating an increase in our pays per control metric in the U.S. of 2 to 3 percentage points. For PEO Services, we are forecasting 12% to 13% revenue growth, with slight pretax margin expansion. We are forecasting about 8% growth in the annual dollar value of ES and PEO worldwide new bookings -- new business bookings from the $1.35 billion sold in fiscal year 2013. And for Dealer Services, we continue to forecast about 8% revenue growth, with about 100 basis points of pretax margin expansion. There is no change to our previous forecast related to the client funds investment strategy, and the detail is available both in the press release and in the supplemental slides on our website. And before we take your questions, I want to remind you that ADP has continued its shareholder-friendly actions. We repurchased 1.4 million ADP shares in the quarter for a total cost of $109 million. And as you know, in November 2013, the board approved a 10% increase in the tax cash dividend, our 39th consecutive year of dividend increases. Now I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from the line of David Togut with Evercore. David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Carlos, you highlighted weakness upmarket in bookings in the December quarter. Can you give us a little bit more detail and perspective around client traction that you're seeing with Vantage HCM? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Sure. I think I'm not sure that we said that we had weakness. I think that it really was an improvement from the first quarter, so I think we're heading in the right direction from a trend standpoint. But mathematically, we still, obviously, came short of where we had our plans. So I think it's fair to say we had weakness, but I just want to make sure that we clarify that it was much better than in the first quarter. And we do have a little bit of visibility now, with January results in, and January, I think, was also even more promising from a trend standpoint than the second quarter. So we're actually feeling better about our comments last quarter that this is really a pipeline issue, that we needed to rebuild the pipeline and that we felt that the second half of the year was going to be better. So again, I think in my comments I talked about an expectation for a strong second half, which, obviously, to get us into the 8% to 10% range would be necessary. And I think January gives us some confidence of that, specifically in the upmarket business that we have, which really includes not just national accounts and Vantage, but also includes multinational benefits administration. There are a number of products that comprise our upmarket business globally. And I think Jan may have some additional information on Vantage, in terms of where we stand there. Jan Siegmund : David, we don't really disclose the actual quarterly numbers of units sold, but we saw a significant increase in Vantage sales quarter-over-quarter, and we're tracking in line with last year and feeling good about the progress we're making with Vantage. Also, as Carlos said, we are upmarket, and particularly in the national account space, we see in addition to the demand for Vantage, also a demand for Workforce Now in the lower end of national accounts. So overall, the momentum is really increasing in national accounts. David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : That's very encouraging. And just to follow-up on a comment you made, Jan, 12% increase in systems development and programming costs year-over-year in the quarter. What do you have in the innovation pipeline? Is this enhancements to existing products or new products? Jan Siegmund : Well, as you know, we have a product strategy that focuses really very much on strategic platforms in ADP, migrating clients from our legacy platform and focusing all our R&D and engineering efforts onto our core platform. And so it's a mix of highly innovative solutions for the next-generation that will really benefit most of our platforms, but in particular upmarket. Vantage was released just last year, so we'll continue to invest and make it better every quarter with new releases. So it is really our making real our promise on innovation. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Carlos, I wonder if you could go back to the PEO for a minute. Obviously, a good quarter in PEO, and it sounds like with the changes that are going on with the ACA that, that service offering is becoming even more relevant. Can you give us any thoughts on whether you think that -- how sustainable that may be, given how things may play out? Is it the initial confusion that then runs off, or is this something that you think continues for a multiyear period? Carlos A. Rodriguez: It's a good question because we obviously over the last 2 or 3 years has -- the law has evolved, and eventually went to -- or parts of it were implemented, we were trying to assess both the upsides and the downsides for not just our PEO, but other parts of our business. So all I can tell you is that it looks right now like it's mostly positive. And based on the January results, which are an outsized proportion of the total sales of the PEO for the year, just because of the way that PEO works with tax restarts and other issues that's probably not worth getting into, a significant portion of our annual sales take place in the actual month of January or start in the month of January because we count, in the PEO, our sales and our clients started the same or in equivalent. And again, we did look at our January results and they were, I would say, even stronger than the first half. And so it really does feel like that business has quite a lot of momentum. And when we look at the factors that are driving that momentum, they do feel like multiyear or that they are not just 1 or 2 quarters. Now, whether multiyear means 5 or 10 years, that's a different story because it's hard to see that far out. But we don't see this momentum letting up in the near future. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : And if you look at -- well, I guess, just a quick follow-on to that, so is that pretty much concentrated in the small business segment? Or are you seeing it overflow into other segments, like in the midmarket, for example, as well, even though it may not be tied to the PEO? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Well, our think our sales force is I think using the Affordable Care Act and changes in regulation and compliance and so forth as, I think, one of the reasons why we think prospects should be talking to us. And particularly the fact that we have integrated products in Workforce Now and in Vantage, I think, really help with that conversation. The ability to have time and attendance, benefits and payroll and HR all in one integrated database is a very, very strong value proposition. So I think it is providing a door-opening opportunity for all segments of ADP. But the PEO, I think, has -- is in a unique position, where they are benefiting, I think, in an outsized manner. I think I'd hasten to say that they're also just executing very well, so we have really great sales leadership there and great salespeople. So I don't want to take anything away from them because when I look back, I just happened to glance as we were talking about the PEO at our historical results in PEO in terms of sales, and this is really the fourth year of very good sales results. So I think we're benefiting somewhat from the wind at our back from ACA, but we've got to give credit where credit is due. They've done just a fabulous job execution-wise. Jan Siegmund : David, just a quick reminder, the size of employees that we serve in the PEO ranges really from 10 to 250 employees, so it really stands a little bit different than our historical segments. So it does cover small- as well as midsized clients in there. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then just quickly on the bookings and the characteristic of those bookings relative to your revenue growth. Obviously, you're coming in a little bit stronger on the revenue growth -- and, sorry, I got dropped from the call, so perhaps this was covered. But is there something -- because of the relative strength of the small business segment and perhaps the midmarket, does that impact the conversion of the bookings to revenue in a different way than maybe what you've seen historically because of that relative strength? Or are we pretty much on kind of a trajectory that we typically are on in terms of the conversion of bookings to revenue? Carlos A. Rodriguez: I'll let Jan give a scientific answer. But I think the short answer is, yes, it helps. A shortfall in our upmarket business in bookings, I think, doesn't affect us as much in the short term as, obviously, a shortfall in our low end of our business because of just how fast those clients start. So I think we've done some modeling. And I think maybe Jan can talk about it a little bit in terms of the potential impact of shortfall in the high-end. But I think you're correct that it tends to be a more muted impact in the short run. It tends to be spread out more over time. And again, you should also keep in mind that our business is quite diversified. So we have a midmarket business, we have a low-end business and we have an upmarket business, we have international, we have global, we have dealer. So this shortfall in sales in the upmarket does not have a significant impact on our revenue growth, either in any of the ensuing quarters or, frankly, even in the long-term, as long as we recover as we expect in the second half. Jan Siegmund : I think I have little to add. I think I just want to moderate that we have, of course, upped our revenue guidance for the year and you saw the strength in our revenues in the quarter. Some of it came due to this help of expiring tax credit programs, but then you saw we had strong balanced growth, we had strong pays per control growth, we had solid retention in the quarter. So all those factors together really helped to drive the organic revenue growth in ES. And the strength in the downmarket, where the conversion is a little bit faster to revenue than in the upmarket, obviously, helps. But as Carlos said, the misses on the upmarket are not impacting our revenue forecast in a meaningful way. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Mihalos with Credit Suisse. Ryan Davis - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : This is Ryan Davis, filling in for George. I want to start with the new bookings growth and kind of the new guidance. Could you give us maybe the puts and takes of what you were seeing when you gave the original guidance, the 8% to 10%, and kind of what differs now? I guess, the first quarter came in a little lower, so it's a little further to overcome. Carlos A. Rodriguez: Well, let me start by saying that we give guidance based on our plan. So we put together a budget or what we call our operating plan, obviously, well before the fiscal year started, that contemplated sales in that range. And then we had just what I would call a blowout finish in the fourth quarter that happened after we put those operating plans together. And clearly, we could have adjusted our guidance in our plans, but we felt that given the momentum we had in that fourth quarter, that we would go forward with the original plan that we had. I did mention in the fourth quarter conference call that based on our experience or my experience personally, even though we weren't trying to change our guidance, that, that fourth quarter strong finish presents some challenges for the first quarter just because of the way our incentive system works and just based on mathematics, just because of how large ADP's sales results are in terms of laws of large numbers. And so I think the 8% to 10% guidance was, I think, what we thought we could do. And that was our objective, and we weren't ready to come off of it. And then the first quarter, as you know, was 1% growth. And the math for us on making a comeback from 1% growth is not easy, again, just because of the laws of large numbers. But again, we thought because of what we had in our pipeline and the fact that we thought that our challenge is really more execution-related in the high end of our business, that we had a shot at still making somewhere in the middle of that range, which is what our intention would be when we gave 8% to 10%. And I think now we've moderated that to 8%, and it could be a little bit higher than 8%, frankly, or it could be a little lower than 8%. But I think prudence, I think, called for mathematically looking at the -- taking a hard look at the numbers and being transparent saying it's harder. It's harder to get to 10% now and it's harder to get to 9%, but we feel very comfortable getting to 8%. Ryan Davis - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And just one more, and sorry to follow-up, I don't want to hit on the bad things, but could you just give a little commentary around the retention in the quarter. I see it's down year-over-year? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Happy to do that, although I wouldn't call it a bad thing. And again, I recognize the numbers are the numbers. But our retention rates are still at historically high levels. Again, we have the benefit of having seen our January results, and for those of you who follow us closely, you know that January is a very important month for us in sale -- or new bookings, but it's also very important for us in terms of retention. Obviously, many clients who decide to take their business in-house or look for another alternative do so December 31, and so those losses will show up in our results at year end, as well as in January. So now we have the benefit of both our December and January period, and I would tell you that coming out of January, we feel very good about our retention, which, again, when I look at it over the last 4 years is, I believe -- I don't have the number in front of me, but it's 20 to 30 basis points up or down each year, still at record levels. And so although we, from an operating plan standpoint, try to put additional pressure on the organization to drive that up a little more, and I think we can because our client migrations in some respects might help us longer term in our retention rates, but the fact of the matter is that they are very, very good right now, and we're very happy with our retention rates. And I think having looked now at the January results, I would say that the quarterly comparison is the same story that we've been sharing for many years, which is we have fluctuations because we have a few large losses here and there, and then it affects the quarter, and then the next quarter, we have, I think, a recovery. So we see nothing in either the quarter or in the January results to lead us to believe that there's any issues with our service or with our retention rates. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : I just wanted to ask quickly about -- you mentioned some severance in the quarter. How much exactly was that? And where are you reducing heads, anywhere in particular, or was it pretty minor? Jan Siegmund : Gary, I mentioned it only because it happened in the quarter to be a little bit higher than normal. We had very low restructuring charges in the first quarter, so the difference popped up a little bit higher. And it's really broad-based and just regular business operations. So it just aggregated in this quarter, drilled a little bit higher, so it made it the second highest item. Nothing to worry about. Really nothing to point out and isolate in there. Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay. I was wondering if you're going to say due to the migrations, you need fewer people supporting the legacy systems or something, but I guess, that's still the future... Jan Siegmund : Not quite yet. I understand the interpretation toward the operational efficiencies due to migration that Carlos and I share the excitement for you, but as you know, the migrations require a big deal of resources actually to be invested themselves in the migrations and then also require the training of our associates on the new platforms, and that takes a little bit of time for them to gain full productivity. So that's kind of the fundamental reason why the efficiencies will trickle down a little bit later. Carlos A. Rodriguez: And I think to -- just to make sure that our level's set and people understand our business model from that perspective, ADP's business is, as you know, quite stable and predictable in terms of recurring revenues. And so there's no question we expect to become more productive and more efficient over time as a result of migrations, but also as a result of other initiatives that we have around productivity. That's been shared very widely internally with our associates and our leadership. Having said that, we hire approximately 4,000 to 5,000 new associates each year because of our size, just because of retirements and turnover. And by the way, we have a very low turnover rate. But that's a lot of people. So this process of us becoming more productive and more efficient will happen in an organized fashion. And you are unlikely to see a multi-hundred-million-dollar restructuring charge, which is not what this is. This is relatively small. But again, just because of who we are, we give you all the details. In the grand scheme of things it's a relatively small number, it just happens to affect the quarter and the results, and we thought you should know that the number was in there. But historically, some of our restructuring charges have been -- and I'm not saying that this one is, but as an example, if we do anything in Europe, even a restructuring that involves 5 to 10 people can add up to $10 million to $12 million. So it's not the case in this example. I just want to put perspective around -- when you do the math, around the size of this restructuring charge. This is not hundreds or thousands of people, and it's not a major shift. And I just want to level set that you are unlikely -- we will manage our way into productivity and efficiency without large-scale disruption to our associates. Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Fair enough. And then just one other quick one. I haven't got an update in a while on the trend towards profitability with the GlobalView product. And just maybe a little more color on -- you talk every once in a while about the contracts you sign. But how many people have actually been -- are up and running in the product? And is that really the key to achieving that profitability and targets unchanged? Any update there. Jan Siegmund : I appreciate that. I'll take this question, I appreciate it. As you know, our multinational offerings are a key part of our global growth strategy. And just for level setting, when this discussion a number of years started, we focused on GlobalView. But today, we're really selling a combined solution between GlobalView and a product that is called Streamline. And almost all GlobalView deals now include also components of Streamline. So we internally really focus on our multinational solutions and, of course, they are profitable and continue to gain margin and growing very nicely. As a matter of fact, they are accretive to our revenue growth and our earnings growth overall ADP. So it's a very nice business that we really like and to do so. But in order to satisfy the academic question background about is GlobalView profitability? Yes, we're pursuing the plan. We indicated I think last year that we would achieve profitability, which we did. And of course, we'll continue to in the second half, and we continue to improve upon that business. We had more sales, as Carlos has reported, on GlobalView, so the product is doing fine, and we're very satisfied with it. But again, it is important to think -- better to think about our multinational offerings, and that's now more than a $300 million business for us, and it's growing very nicely. About 1 million employees are processing on GlobalView right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : This is Ashish, calling on behalf of Bryan Keane. Looks like you had a pretty solid quarter for small- and medium-business bookings. And as you said, coming out of the selling season, that was pretty strong as well. Now the small-business formation overall, that has been pretty weak. So obviously, you're gaining share. So I was wondering if you could just provide some details on the competitive dynamics, like, are you gaining share from regional or national players, or is it mostly in-house moving over? I was just wondering if you could give some more color on that. And as well as talk about pricing and discounting, how that has trended during the selling season. Carlos A. Rodriguez: We haven't heard anything different about pricing or discounting. I think, obviously, we keep track -- very close track of those dynamics. And I'm not aware of any changes in the market in terms of pricing or discounting. In terms of the success in that business, I think, again, like the PEO, I think the first order of business is to give credit to the management team and to the organizations that have been working multiple years on making sure they have the right products, the right leadership, the right service because you do have to execute in this business and I'm sure in any other business, and they are executing quite well. I think that our success there, I think, is broad-based. Again, we do look on an annual basis and then in our strategic planning process at shifts in the marketplace in terms of in-house versus regional versus national competitors, and then we track obviously monthly and then quarterly where sales are coming from and where losses are going to. And I wish there was something exciting to report or something that jumps out, but it's just broad-based success, I think, across the board. And so it's not any particular category or size range, it's just across the board. And I think it's related to the very strong products and very strong execution, both in sales, implementation and in service. Jan Siegmund : Just to answer your question regarding the discounting level, I did actually, prior to this call, review and anticipated your question and looked out across our business, and we have not seen any significant changes in trend relative to discounting level. As a reminder, approximately 1% of our revenue growth is driven by price increases. Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : That's good, good to know. And one much more broader question about the industry trend. We've seen some increase in charter around private exchanges, large employers contemplating moving to private health-care exchanges. I was just wondering if you have seen similar trends, and if you can comment on what that means, would it have any impact on PEO or any other business, any impact on ADP? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Well, there really would be no impact on the PEO, at least not for the next, I believe, it's 3 or 4 years, because the exchanges are really not right now open to small companies. They're really, I think, really for large companies. And so, the -- I'm sorry, I think that's correct. I don't know if it's the public or the private exchanges. But my information is that this is really -- the exchanges are really not an issue for the PEO until I believe it's 2017. And then we have to -- as we get closer to that, we would, obviously, keep you informed in terms of whether we think there is going to be an issue or not. Because as of -- when we first started this process 3 years ago, I think it just doesn't help to -- the lesson learned is that we have to get a little closer, based on what you've seen around all the changes that the government has made to the original laws and regulations, I think it's just better for us to wait until we get closer to have that discussion. So I think no impact on the PEO. The only, I think, impact that I think we need to talk about and think about is our benefits administration business, which, again, in relative terms, it's an important business, as all of our businesses are important, but it's relatively small in the overall scheme of ADP's total revenues. But that business, we are hearing prospects and clients asking us about private exchanges. And so we are looking at alternatives, including partnerships and other options, building our own private exchange. There's a lot of ways you could go in terms of creating a solution. Some of which are easier to implement, for example, a partnership. And others, whether it's an acquisition or doing something organically, are probably a little bit harder to do. But we are hearing, I think, from some of our larger clients, specifically the ones that have a lot of hourly employees who are highly sensitive to employee benefit costs, we're hearing a lot of questions about private exchanges. Having said that, a lot of clients are not even bringing it up because they are very comfortable with the benefit plans that they have and the approach that they're taking with their current health-care carriers and their current health-care plans. I think we all read the papers, I think you tend to see restaurant chains and there are certain industries that are very sensitive to employee benefit costs that are very interested in private exchanges. And we, I think, are currently looking at how to fulfill that need for our benefits administration business. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jim MacDonald with First Analysis. James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division : Going back to the PEO, could you tease out for me the strengths there between converting some of your existing customers and selling new customers? And as a follow-up in advance, are either of those particularly impacted by ACA uncertainties or trying to escape the impact of the ACA? Carlos A. Rodriguez: That's a great question, because I think it's a really good example of, I think, the improvements we've had over the last several years, starting 5, 6, 7 years ago when we started focusing on this kind of OneADP strategy. One of the important, I think, benefits that we thought we could get is more synergies from cross-selling, among other synergies in our business. And the last -- certainly, this last quarter showed, and I think the last several quarters, and even for 2 or 3 years, an improving trend in terms of the amount of business that the ADP is -- I'm sorry, that the PEO is getting from some of the sister divisions within ADP. Specifically, I want to point out that the -- our mid-market business and major accounts, which, as you know, goes all the way from 50 up to 999, so in the low end of that major accounts business, there's been a really nice improvement in the amount of leads being given over to the PEO that have been converted into PEO clients. Very, very happy to see that, and I think that goes back to a lot of hard work over multiple years of aligning incentives and people working together to make that happen. Other than that, I'm not sure that we have a lot to report because I think in our low-end of the business, we've always had a very good exchange of leads between our SBS business and the PEO. I think where there's been the noticeable improvement is in the mid market and in major accounts, and we're very pleased with it. James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division : And just my second part of the question, were new customers kind of frozen by some of the ACA implementation issues or existing customers impacted, thinking about those -- some of those implementation issues? Carlos A. Rodriguez: So I think it's a great question. I think what -- the way I would say it is that, we've always believed, whether it was in Y2K or ACA or other major compliance issues, that you get more at bats. There's just a lot more activity, because people are looking for help and they're looking for solutions. And we have a more-than-5,000-person direct sales force, and it is a huge advantage in terms of being able to take advantage of these disruptions, if you will, to the average small business, midsized business or large business. And so we spent the last 2 or 3 years gearing up our sales force to be able to talk about ACA, and the day has arrived where there are a lot of people who have a lot of questions. And we're there to answer those questions and at the same time, hopefully, sell them solutions to help them address those questions. So I think that's what's happening in some parts of our business, that we're just getting a lot more -- there's a lot more activity and a lot more at bats, and we're converting some of that, obviously, into new bookings and eventually into revenue. So I think it just provides a nice opportunity for us and for our direct sales force to go out and help our clients solve -- or address the uncertainties that they're facing. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Paul Thomas with Goldman Sachs. Paul B. Thomas - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : It sounds like pays per control is still lagging in Europe. Is there any expectation that it will improve in the back half of fiscal '14? Jan Siegmund : Paul, I've studied the pays per control metrics in detail for each of the European countries, and I wish I could report that I see an improvement. It is at the rounding error, a slight improvement, and you see a couple of countries slightly improving. Of course, Germany and France would be those. But overall, Europe is kind of flattish on the pays per control. I just -- as a point of clarification, that does not translate in declining revenue growth. Europe is still growing for us as a revenue contributor and, of course, nicely expanding also its margin. So while we see the economic environment impacting sales are difficult in some countries, but, overall, we continue to grow our revenues based on new business that we could do good retention rates and a little bit mitigated by these pays per control weakness. Paul B. Thomas - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. Just one more from my end. Could you talk about the increase in margin expectations from Employer Services, how much of the improvement was lower sales compensation versus specific actions you took in the quarter? Jan Siegmund : It's not specific actions I would describe. I think you see some of the organic revenue growth acceleration is helping us on the margins. We have good control on our operating expenses. So we have FTE for employee growth is slower than revenue growth. So we're kind of carefully executing on the program of driving productivity in the business unit in an organic way that Carlos just described. And so there could be a little bit of improvement on the margin due to the sales expense, but it's a mix, as sales get more productive as we have achieved higher sales productivity and a little bit of slightly lower sales growth. But that's probably not even fully factored into our forecast. So it's kind of really mostly these operational efficiencies that we mentioned to you. Carlos A. Rodriguez: I think just to be specific on the -- because we mentioned in the first quarter that we benefited from lower sales costs and that helps us a little bit in the margin. It is not the case in the second quarter because even though we do have good sales productivity still, as you know, our sales results were 7% increase in the second quarter versus the first quarter growth rate of 1%. And some portion of our sales cost is variable, obviously, related to commission expense. And so on a sequential basis, the second quarter compared to the first quarter, we did not have the kind of, I guess, wind at our back. In fact, sequentially, our sales cost not only increased in absolute terms, but increased in relative terms as a percent of revenue. So I just want to make sure that, that was clear. We are -- continue to invest in sales, we continue to add headcount and, obviously, we're also expecting, I think, some level of productivity. So I think the numbers that we shared with you in terms of the mix of headcount versus productivity, I think, still stands for the year and for our forecast. And this benefit that we had in the first quarter, which was an unfortunate benefit because of the low growth rate, we did not experience in the second quarter. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Smitti with Morgan Stanley. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : This is Danyal Hussain, calling in for Smitti. I just wanted to touch back on PEO. So as you guys raised growth expectations, is that a function of growing popularity of the PEO model as a whole, or is this something that's more TotalSource specific? Jan Siegmund : If you look at the market and you have now a number of competitors public or going public, you see that ADP has the strongest organic growth number. And for a number of years, really, our business model, at least since its inception 13 years ago, 15 years ago, we have really grown exclusively through organic growth. So the ADP sales model and our success in distribution and executing well is the main source of our success. And I think, organic growth rates in our competitors are more muted, and that's certainly a standout for ADP's model. Carlos A. Rodriguez: I think I would just add, again, since I came from that business, that the popularity of the PEO ebbs and flows for a variety of reasons, but ADP's PEO continues steadily along. I think it's 4x the size it was when ADP first started in the business through a couple of acquisitions and it's almost doubled just in the last 4 years. So it's really quite an impressive performance by that team. But it is fair to say that, that industry or that category does ebb and flow for a variety of reasons, depending on external factors around insurance markets. And -- but the business, it's in an industry we have to be cautious in terms of your expectations. We happen to be the beneficiaries of having a captive sales force that provides lead to our PEO sales organization, we have good leadership, we have good technology, so we, I think, are in a very good position. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And then on international, I recognize Europe is still floating [ph], can you maybe talk about revenue growth in international as a whole, and maybe how it's different in your multinational clients versus the local international? Carlos A. Rodriguez: I think our international business still has quite respectable growth, frankly because we have really great retention rates there. And so even though, as Jan said, sales are difficult or have been difficult in the first half, and I'd hasten to add that last year, we had actually pretty good sales, even in a very bad environment, we had good sales. But when you add all those ingredients together, the very strong retention rate with really a minor decrease in pays per control because it just not -- doesn't drive that much in terms of revenue drag, and then just the size of the sales not, if you will, as a total sales in relation to how much we lose because of retention being so strong, I think, leaves us with a very decent organic growth rate in international. And then we, on top of that, benefited a little bit from the acquisition that we made in South America to expand our presence in Latin America. That's giving us a little bit of a lift in our international business. But our organic growth rate there is still quite strong. Jan Siegmund : Actually, in an interesting way, the organic growth rates between U.S. and international are about the same, and the weakness or softer revenue growth in Europe is offset by strength in Latin America and strength in our multinational business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research : Carlos, you talked a lot about Workforce Now and RUN, and it seems as though you're getting some benefit as clients are migrating, or at least that's what it looks like as your margins are improving in ES. But is there a way for you to size what the eventual benefit will be once you get all your clients migrated? Because I know you've also said there's some additional costs right now because you do have 2 platforms. Carlos A. Rodriguez: I think that it's a good question. And I think it's a risk of having you get out in front of us from a margin standpoint in the future. I think it's important -- more important for you to understand in the short run kind of what is happening. In the short run, I think Jan said it best that our margin improvement in Employer Services is not related to client migration. Our client migrations activities are putting pressure on our margins. We are investing very, very heavily both in our -- in all 3 of our segments, in the low end, on midmarket and our high-end, because it's a strategic imperative for us to get our clients on a new platforms. I was looking at some statistics over the quarter where the number of clients that are left on our nonstrategic platform on midmarket have declined fairly significantly and, simultaneously, our retention rate has improved quite a bit. So it just feels like the right thing to do to continue to spend at whatever level we need to spend in order to accelerate those client migrations. And by the way, that will not always be the case. We had one example in our time and attendance business where we shut down a platform, and so it was not an organized, orderly transition. And that had a negative impact on retention. So those -- it's really a mixed story. That's a long way of saying that you should not interpret our margin improvement as coming from already benefits of our client migration. The benefits of our client migrations are yet to occur. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research : And then just as a follow-up, and maybe there isn't a relationship, but we're seeing more clients migrate to these new platforms, more clients interested in mobile applications. As a result, on the small business side, have you seen any change at all in how your customers are buying your services, as in are more customers today than 2 years ago are using the Internet? So in relation, do you need to change maybe the way you sell your products? Carlos A. Rodriguez: It's absolutely changed. And again, visually, I'll give you one, and I'll give you a factual. Visual is our sales force are out doing demos with iPads now. Two years ago, they weren't doing that. Our old EasyPay platform, I don't believe we had a demo, forget about doing it on an iPad, it's just not -- it wasn't even a possibility. So the factual numbers are that 4, 5 years ago, the majority of our clients were on what we call either call-in or fax, so they would basically send us their information. They would call us in and tell us, \"This is how many hours for this person and this is how many hours for that.\" This is in small business is what I'm describing. That now with RUN, new sales in RUN has completely flipped over where more than 70% of our new sales are basically web-based sales, where they're using our -- where they're not calling in their payroll, they're not having any interaction other than service interactions if they have questions or if they have issues with their payroll. Obviously, that's what we are about, is a full-service outsourcing solutions. So we do take questions and phone calls or chats or emails. But the fact of the matter is there's been a tremendous change in the last 3 years in how we sell our business and how our clients receive the service that we provide or receive the technology, specifically in RUN, which I think was your question. Jan Siegmund : If I may add on the distribution side, in a down market, we sell through our sales force. But we have also channel relationships in the bank and the accounting channel, and the good deal of our businesses are now also generated through certain marketing and web-based leads. The actual sale, I think, is still going mostly through either our inside sales force or field salespeople, but the lead generation through these channels all have changed and have contributed to the growth. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research : So should that translate to lower selling costs as we move forward? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Well, it has. So I think our SBS sales force is one of the, I think, one of the highlights in terms of our sales productivity improvement over the last several years. And so I believe we have gotten, I think, some benefit from what you are describing. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Ryan Cary - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : This is Ryan Cary, calling in for Jason. Just a quick one. Are you expecting acquisitions to contribute any material amount in near-term revenue growth? I know you mentioned in the past couple of quarters LatAm acquisition, but I just wasn't sure how big that's going to be, and maybe you'd give us some sort of idea on when we should see some benefit. Carlos A. Rodriguez: We continue to be out there looking at stuff, and we've recently looked at some things and, I mean, I think our normal practice, as you know, is we can't comment. So we can't really say specifically what we're looking at and what we are not looking at. But we are, contrary to popular belief, because I probably have developed a reputation, we are open, we have capital, and we are open to acquisitions if they fit our long-term strategy. And our long-term strategy has been laid out very clearly. And so we're not looking to just cobble things together and add additional platforms that are not going to be integrated into our strategic platform. But if we find things that either fit or can be fitted in relatively quickly that accelerate our sales growth and, hence, our revenue growth, we will use our capital to get that done. Ryan Cary - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay. And forgive me if you already mentioned this, I might have just missed it. Did you announce the -- your expectation for the increase in the sales force headcount for the year? Is that still at about 4%? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Yes. And I think we are right now running 3%. Jan Siegmund : 3%. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America. Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : HR analytics is a hot area right now, and I wanted to get your take on how you're positioned in it and what you think perhaps you're differentiating points are in the areas that you might want to focus on to add more? Carlos A. Rodriguez: That's a good question because actually when Jan was answering the question about the 12% increase in our R&D expense, one of the things that I can mention about that is that analytics specifically is one of the categories where we are -- and I think Jan mentioned some exciting things that we're working on to enhance our current platform but also to provide kind of new solutions to our clients to help them more with their business needs. I think analytics is an area where we've been investing quite a lot of time and money, specifically our -- what we've been calling our innovation labs, the ADP Innovation Labs, which, by the way, we've now opened an office in Chelsea, New York, and we're really attracting some incredible talents. And so part of what those folks are doing is working on those types of solutions and specifically, some of the business intelligence and analytics solutions that we think are kind of the next step in helping businesses really manage their human capital assets better. So we are -- we've seen some previews. Jan and I, I think, have seen some examples of the things we're working on, and we're quite excited about what, hopefully, is to come here in the near future. Jan Siegmund : Actually, we released in the second quarter and we talked in our last call, I think, about our HR analytics tool that's now in pilot with a number of clients. We have shown it at several industry fairs, received tremendous amount of feedback. And the fundamental differentiator is, of course, not only the functionality and the thought process that we engineered into the product, but it can rely and base its insight on an unparalleled amount of data, with 600,000 clients at our fingertips and information that is really deep and with a broad history of it, will allow clients really just better understand how to run the HR business and put ADP in a position to be truly a strategic partner for our clients. So it is really an opportunity that we are looking forward to fully leverage. And if you follow out national success of our national employment success -- National Employment Report, we anticipate similar type of credibility and power in our HR analytics product. Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : And then as a follow-up, the focus on Vantage or the strategy so far has been more to sell to new clients as opposed to migrations. And I'm wondering if there is some point in the future when perhaps you'd consider turning more to trying to convert the existing client base. Jan Siegmund : We migrated also clients in Vantage. But as -- you're right, as we scale and build our implementation organization and optimize the implementation processes of Vantage, we are focused on leveraging that capacity for market shares, competitive market, we like our product, and that's the focus, I think, what you see us more is open Vantage up to a variety of bundles, from standalone payroll Vantage to a full suite of Vantage as we build it out. But medium run, you should expect us to convert clients onto the Vantage platform. So it is just a matter of timing, and Vantage will be following a similar path over time as Workforce Now did. Carlos A. Rodriguez: Yes, and I think just to emphasize, I think Jan mentioned this, I think, especially earlier in the call in answer to a question, that we continue to invest in Vantage. So I just want to kind of reiterate that, that the days are over of us kind of building a platform and then spending the next 5 or 10 years, and it's not because that was the wrong thing to do, it's because times have changed. And so we -- you should hear that we are making -- continuing significant investments in our upmarket products, including Vantage, not just around analytics, but around usability, around the product itself, feature, functionality. And so we are making significant investments in Vantage and in the upmarket products as we speak. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin with JPMorgan. Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Just a couple of follow-up questions to past questions. Just first on the upper end of the market and replenishing the pipeline, just curious how the visibility and predictability of the new sales look now versus, whatever, a quarter ago or a year ago. I caught some of the 3 deals you talked about. But just in general, the replenishing of the pipeline is what I was curious about. Carlos A. Rodriguez: I think the place where we feel the most positive about the pipeline is the MNC business. But it also happens to be the most lumpy of our businesses. So I personally went on a sales call for a multinational client that was a $15 million annual deal, and so we feel pretty good that we're going to that deal, but whether we get it in February or we get in March, I think, is in the grand scheme of things, not the only important thing. And, hence, we have to be careful. So I think historically, our multinational business, I told you specifically, have been our most volatile and most lumpy business. But right now, it feels pretty good. This meeting in Paris, like we had the Who's Who of the Global 100. I mean, I'm not going to mention names, obviously, but these are all names that are household names, and these were prospects. Some clients, but many, many prospects, as well, and I think we even closed one right there at the meeting. So we're feeling pretty good about that pipeline. I think in our upmarket core national accounts business, by that I mean payroll, HR, kind of the core business, I think that pipeline also feels pretty good, and our January results, frankly, were good from a growth standpoint. And there's a couple of other categories in national accounts, frankly, that are not performing as well. And I mentioned some of the other categories that make up our upmarket. But in that core business, we're actually feeling pretty good, too, about what's happening with the pipeline and also the conversion of that pipeline into contracts. Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Understood. So the upper, upper end, is really just the timing issue, you feel good about the pipeline? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Yes. Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. Just on the -- just I know retention was asked about and I know we're nitpicking here about whether it's less than 50 bps. But any areas stand out in terms of surprising attrition, focused on major and national specifically? Jan Siegmund : If you look at our losses, the second quarter losses on an absolute dollar value also are not that meaningful to us, so it's a lower-loss quarter. And we did see it's not focused on one business unit. We had, really, a number of business units coming a little bit down also. It may play, if you look a quarter, a year over back, we had a very strong retention quarter. So I wouldn't over read, again, the 30 bps or so into anything here. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Robert W. Baird. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : With regards to the sales target for the year of 8% growth, given what the performance was in the first half, you do have some tough comps coming up in the second half, particularly fourth quarter of '13, how comfortable are you with that, with the 8% target? I mean, I know it's your best estimate, but... Carlos A. Rodriguez: I think it's a very fair question, I'll just use history as my -- to help me. Last year, I think we entered into the fourth quarter -- and I'm not sure this necessarily helps me or hurts me, because as you've said, in some ways a strong fourth quarter creates a tougher comparison. But last year, we entered the fourth quarter with 9% growth and we ended up with 11%. And so we do have the ability to execute in our sales force, and that's what we're going to do. And so I think we obviously are very -- we are constantly scrubbing our forecast, looking at our pipeline and, again, there are a few large deals that can go one way or the other, but we have 5 months to get those done and get the contracts signed. So again, our best information is that we feel pretty good about the 8%, and being the optimist, I always hope it could be 9%. And could it be also a little bit short of 8%? Yes, but I'm focused more on the 9% than I am on the 8%. So I think we're pretty comfortable, when we see the January results and we see the size of the January results and how much quota has been extended through the end of January, I think that our level of confidence is good. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Great. And it also sounds like the pipeline on the upper end has been rebuilt since the changes that you put in place. Is that a correct read? Carlos A. Rodriguez: I think that it's a correct read, but you're maybe reading too much into it. Changes that are made in a large account mature sales force do not necessarily translate into results in 1 or 2 quarters. I think what you're seeing is just regular -- the cycle working its way through, which is the pipeline was drained in the fourth quarter and it's being rebuilt. So I don't think it's fair to attribute it to any specific actions we took, although we did take actions, and we think those actions will, over the course of multiple years, make them stronger and better national account. I don't think that we can take credit for the short-term results. Jan Siegmund : Can I add one more comment to it while we're focusing a lot on the upmarket? It should not be underestimated that we have reported strength in our mid- and small-market segments and PEO separately. And as you might imagine, that's going to also add comfort to our full-year forecast. And that consistency has been strong for both quarters throughout this fiscal year. So I think it would be also important to look at the entirety of our new business bookings volume and not focus on just a segment in the marketplace. Carlos A. Rodriguez: And I think it's important, again, even though we don't disclose business by business, back to the diversification of our business, none of the categories that we are talking about or mentioned are disproportionately large. They are all large, and they all make up the $1.4 billion, is it, that we are forecasting for our sales for the year. And so, again, fortunately, we have the benefit of being in many categories and being global. And I think Jan is right that we clearly would like to have better results in the upper end in the first half of the year. But as you saw, we delivered 7% either in the face of what I would call historically unprecedented headwinds from an execution standpoint. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Fully appreciate the strength in both majors and SBS, and I was taking for granted that, that was going to continue to be strong. With regards to the nice performance, with regards to the margins on the ES side, you mentioned that you're actually spending as you're making the conversions going through. What would you attribute -- what would be the biggest single contribution to the really strong margin performance that we're seeing on an incremental basis, particularly when we strip out the interest impact? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Well, I think at the business segment level, again, we have this quirky issue with the way interest is calculated at the ADP level. It drags our revenue growth. You don't see the operating leverage as clearly, but when you look in the segments, I think Jan said it well, which is really operating leverage. So it's really growing our expenses slower than our revenues. And again, just because of the nature of our business model, this is not -- we don't have a business model where we go and cut $100 million in expense and then 2, 3 years later, we have to put back $300 million. The trick for us is to grow our expenses at half the rate of our revenue growth or slower. That means that our expenses are still growing, but they're growing at a slower rate. So that still allows us to invest in things. It allows us to more focus on migration, but it does create scarcity of resources because we have to decide where to put those resources. But we're not cutting cost. We're reducing the growth rate of cost and achieving operating scale and operating efficiency, which is a very organized and very methodical and very good way to run a business. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Great. And then last question. Since last time I saw you, rates have changed. How should we think about when we hit the inflection point as it relates to the float income, assuming that rates stabilize around these levels? Jan Siegmund : We've just reconfirmed our guidance about the impact of our -- the net impact of the client funds strategy and the guidance stays impact -- in tact. So the forward rates move a little bit up and down, and I think we are speaking with Carlos' first quarter comment that in FY '15, we should see an even or slightly up on interest rate. We're going to give more visibility to all of that for you traditionally at third quarter. We're planning to do so also this year. Carlos A. Rodriguez: But again, I think, I don't know if we mentioned the balances growth. So we had -- and, again, trying to focus on both the positive and the negative, so our balance growth was quite good. And I think some of it is a reflection of a decent economic backdrop. Some of that is also related to growth in units, starting new business, et cetera. But the overall balance growth is quite good and helps offset some of the negatives in terms of some of the interest rate drag. I think as Jan was alluding to, as we get to '15, '16 and beyond, when interest rates become -- if they become a positive, this balance growth combined with a better interest rate environment is something that we look forward to. Operator : And we have 2 more questions in queue. Your next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery. Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : We talked a couple -- well, at an Analyst Day that you had obviously in the distant future -- or, I'm sorry, in the distant past, and you mentioned that as you continue to move to more of a technology platform, that the structure of the company may start to look a little bit different. I was wondering, is there any association here between some of the restructuring and what the new look ADP would look like now that it's more technology-focused? And maybe you can just give us an update on where we stand with that. Carlos A. Rodriguez: So based on your comment about the distant past, it sounds like you missed us and you want to have another Analyst Day. Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : Yes, sure, why not. Carlos A. Rodriguez: I think on your comment -- I'll let Jan make a comment also, but I think we are -- the restructuring discussion, again, just to reemphasize, is not related to any broad strategic issue. It was housekeeping, if you will, in terms of the size of it. Having said that, over the last couple of years, and I think we continue -- it'll continue into the next few years. We are trying to invest more in R&D, and you see it creeping up, and creeping is the typical ADP way of doing things. It's not a dramatic change, but rather than R&D becoming a lower and lower percent of revenue, it's actually now reversed and has become -- it's actually grown as a percent of revenue, only slightly, but it has grown as a percent of revenue. And even if it grows at the same rate of revenue, that would be, in my estimation, an investment, because in other places, we're gaining operating efficiency. So there's no question that we are investing more in our R&D, and that changes the face of ADP, if you will. The opening of this office in Chelsea, New York is a fairly significant change for us in terms of our way of doing things, in terms of the types of people we're trying to attract and the place that we're doing business. And there's a few other examples of that as well. So there is change under way, but I think you would be -- it would not be right to read into these -- some of these numbers or try to find it in the numbers because we have, on an annualized basis, $12 billion of revenue and approximately $10 billion in expense. And the way we look at things is we've got a lot in that $10 billion that we can move around to really focus on our strategic priorities and imperatives without creating any big problems for you guys, for us or for our shareholders. And that's what we're doing. Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : Got it. Okay. And then with the move to technology, I guess maybe my focus here, where I wanted to ask my question, was on the smaller business side. With the focus on technology there, are you seeing any change in any of the price points for any of your products? If you could talk about the small business or the medium to large. I'm just wondering if there's any kind of structural change in pricing. Carlos A. Rodriguez: I think Jan was right that -- or correct in pointing out that we have different channels that we use that actually allow us to compete in different places from a price standpoint. For example, the banking channel would be slightly different from our traditional channel, and we have a few places but there's really nothing to report over the last 2 or 3 years. There's been no major shift in any of those channels or any of those price points. We do keep our eye on it because for the last 15 years, we've been told that the technology is going to replace -- technology by itself is going to replace ADP, frankly, in every one of our segment. And all we see is the opposite, because with the Affordable Care Act or more complexity in compliance or the trend towards outsourcing, whatever the factors are, they drive people towards our solutions, which are to have technology paired with compliance and service. And now with analytics and other tools, we're elevating our purpose to really helping our clients make their businesses successful. And I think when you package all of that together, I think we're pretty confident that we have a highly differentiated business model that continues to win and continues to win at the prices that we've been able to charge historically. So we have nothing to report other than, I think, the fact that things are all on track or in the same place from a pricing standpoint in all of our segments. Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then just lastly for me, how do you feel -- have you seen any change in the competitive environment at the small business level? And maybe you could just talk about how you feel like you'd progressed on the technology front. Carlos A. Rodriguez: In the small business level, again, you know some of our national competitors -- you might not know that we have hundreds of regional and local competitors everywhere. And so, again, my hats off to the field sales organization, to the field service organization, the people who run these businesses on the low-end because it is hand-to-hand combat and it's a fight every day. So they are just out-executing the competition in a lot of ways and a lot of respect. Some of it is product, some of it is technology and some of it is just good people and good execution and good focus. And so again, I wish I had a more exciting story, but I think it's just great people executing very well. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Just one quick question. Just sort of looking at your new sort of sales growth expectation, the 8%, and I think you alluded to last year was 11%, and then sort of just coupling that with call retention, say, flat to maybe modestly down year-to-date, is it a reasonable inference to expect your revenue growth in '15 to decelerate relative to the '14 growth rate? Because I've always thought about sales growth and retention being the key factors driving your revenue growth. Carlos A. Rodriguez: They are the key factors to driving revenue growth, and I would just tell you that, again, the retention rate is one quarter, and it's not our expectation for retention for the full year, and our retention results in January would give me a good degree of confidence that we can achieve our annual objective for retention. Caveat that by saying that things could change. We have an economic calamity, some sort of issue. But based on our year-to-date January results, we don't expect retention to be a drag on revenue growth in '15. The difference between 8% sales growth and 9% sales growth also is not a material impact on our revenue growth in '15. So I think it's hard to -- the math is the math. It has an impact. And you can the math yourself in terms of what 1% translates into of sales growth. And I believe it's somewhere around $13 million, $10 million or $13 million of revenue growth. But I would not call that a significant impact to ADP's revenue growth, and -- because we can all do the math ourselves. I don't know that, that has a material impact on our growth rate in '15. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos A. Rodriguez: Thank you very much for joining us today. As you probably could tell from our tone, we're once again very pleased with our results for the quarter and appreciate the contributions from all our associates and our leaders globally. We continue to be, I think, committed to our shareholder-friendly actions around returning cash to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. And I think you are seeing that in our actions, and we, obviously, as you can tell, also remain very focused on delivering against the HCM strategy that we have laid out. So I thank you again for joining us, and we look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets Canada Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Automatic Data Processing Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Elena Charles, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please, begin. Elena Charles : Thank you. Good morning. I'm here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our Third Quarter Fiscal 2014 Earnings Call and Webcast. Before discussing our financial results, Carlos and Jan will talk about the planned spinoff of Dealer Services announced on April 10 and our latest Human Capital Management technology innovations. Finally, after Jan discusses the quarterly results and the full year forecast, he will provide his thoughts about the expected impact of our client funds investment strategy for fiscal 2015. I'd like to remind everyone that during today's conference call, we will make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events, and as such, involve some risks. And these are discussed in our earnings release and in our periodic filings with the SEC. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Carlos. Carlos A. Rodriguez: Thank you, Elena. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. As Elena mentioned, we have several exciting topics to cover on our call. I'll begin with our strategic decision to spin off the Dealer Services business, a decision which we believe will benefit ADP shareholders by allowing each management team to focus on its respective industry. For ADP, this deepens our commitment to being a global leader in Human Capital Management and positions us well for future growth. For Dealer Services, it allows them to focus on expanding their leadership position in the global automotive retail industry. You might ask, why spin off Dealer Services now? The global retail automotive market is evolving at a fast pace, fueled by digital marketing and other innovations where Dealer Services currently enjoys a market-leading position. In addition, this industry is the strongest it has been since 2007 with U.S. vehicle sales continuing to recover to pre-crisis levels. In separating the 2 companies, we expect Dealer Services to be a strong, independent company with solid growth prospects, a strong competitive market position, an experienced management team, and an aligned capital structure. We fully believe that this is the right decision at the right time for both companies and for the shareholders. And now I'll turn the call over to Jan for his comments regarding the transaction. Jan Siegmund : Good morning, everyone. As Carlos mentioned, we believe this transaction will better enable both ADP and Dealer Services to pursue their respective growth strategies and drive long-term shareholder value. The structure of the transaction will be a 100% spinoff of the Dealer Services business into a separate, independent publicly traded company. This will be a tax-free transaction for our shareholders, and we anticipate its completion in early October, subject, of course, to applicable regulatory requirements. We expect to file the initial Form 10 in early June, and plan to have an investor roadshow with the management team of the new Dealer Services company as we get closer to the spin date. Additionally, we will be looking carefully at costs as we create the appropriate public company infrastructure for Dealer Services. Although we will offset some of these costs within ADP's existing infrastructure, we expect there will be a moderate increase in expenses when looking across both companies. As previously disclosed, we anticipate that ADP will receive at least $700 million from the Dealer Services business at the completion of this transaction. And our intent is to use this cash to repurchase shares of ADP stock, subject to market conditions. Regarding ADP's dividend, our intent following the spinoff is to increase the dividend annually subject to board approval, keeping intact our 39-year track record of dividend increases. However, we expect to grow the dividend at a slower rate than earnings to allow us to return to our pre-separation target dividend payout ratio of 55% to 60% in about 2 years. Any dividend to be paid by the new Dealer Services public company will be determined by the Dealer Services Board of Directors and will be incremental to the ADP dividend. Another area I would like to discuss with you is ADP's credit ratings, which were updated as a result of the announcement to spin off Dealer Services. We anticipated this change in ADP's credit ratings and fully contemplated it as part of our analysis. We are proud of our exceptionally strong AA credit ratings with a stable outlook from both Moody's and Standard & Poor's. In fact, you should note our ratings are still the best in our industry. The changed ratings are not expected to have any direct financial impact on our business. In addition, neither the spinoff of Dealer Services nor our updated credit ratings will change our disciplined approach to how we move more than $1 trillion in client funds each year. And I now will turn back the call over to Carlos. Carlos A. Rodriguez: Thank you, Jan. We'll provide updates on future calls about the progress we're making towards separating the Dealer Services business from ADP. But once again, I believe that this is the right decision at the right time for both companies and for our shareholders. I'm excited for the future of both companies and especially pleased about the investments we are making in Employer Services to further establish ourselves as a leading global provider of Human Capital Management solutions. So with that, let me share some highlights of how these investments are translating into our latest technology innovation. Earlier this month, we held our annual ADP Meeting of the Minds conference for our upmarket clients. I'm pleased to say that we hosted more than 1,000 participants, where we previewed exciting works coming out of our ADP Innovation Labs. Our next-generation user experience will transform the way our clients' employees manage their work life through a host of new features that fully leverage tablet and smartphone capabilities. Today's employees expect easy-to-use technology that is similar to how they bank, use social media, book travel, and so much more. As a result, ADP's new user experience will set the industry standard, enabling employees and their managers to collaborate, perform key business functions more effectively, and in short, fully utilize the power of our HCM solutions in an intuitive yet powerful way. What we previewed at our Annual Meeting of the Minds provided a glimpse into innovations that increase the ability for employees to manage their work life, ranging from creating powerful pre- and onboarding solutions that welcome new employees and leverage social media to get them productive more quickly; to finding the healthcare plan that best fits themselves and their families; easily viewing and managing their schedules, including social shift swapping; and transforming the traditional paystub into a financial planning tool through realtime paycheck modeling that allows employees to immediately see how changes to withholdings impact their pay. Of course, all these offerings will be device agnostic and available on tablets, mobile devices, PCs, and so forth. We built these innovations to be predictive by guiding employees through suggested HR selections based on choices made by similar employees from within ADP's data-rich ecosystem. And we view this as just the beginning of how we can use data to help our clients and their employees make better decisions. Our Meeting of the Minds participants were very excited about the product demos and also excited to know the first rollout of this next-generation experience will be available in the early fall. And now, for some highlights on the quarter. ADP reported solid revenue growth of 7%. I'm especially pleased with the 14% growth in worldwide new business bookings for the quarter in Employer Services and PEO combined. This acceleration during the quarter was led by double-digit growth in the PEO, the mid-market and our multinational solutions. We believe these results are evidence of our strong value proposition relating to ACA and compliance in the PEO as well as the competitive strength of our Workforce Now and multinational offerings. Our upmarket teams also experienced a good quarter with new business bookings improving sequentially through the first 3 quarters. Vantage sales were also good this quarter, and we also sold a good number of Workforce Now deals in the lower end of National Accounts. We are on track to achieve our new business bookings growth forecast for Employer Services and PEO combined of approximately 8% for the year, but we do have hard work ahead of us due to a tough global comparison in the final quarter of the fiscal year. Now moving on to PEO. As I mentioned a moment ago, new business bookings in the PEO were strong, and we continue to see positive momentum in this business. Growth in average worksite employees paid was a strong 18% for the quarter. Moving on to Dealer Services, the global outlook for the automotive industry continues to be positive. Continental Europe is showing some signs of slow and gradual improvement, and the U.S. auto sales continue to advance towards pre-recessionary levels. Dealer Services performed well in the quarter as it continues to grow its client base with solid competitive win rates while also benefiting from increased digital advertising revenues. And before I turn the call over to Jan, I want to update you on the progress we're making with migrating clients from our legacy platforms to our new cloud solution. I'm pleased to report that migrations to ADP RUN continue to progress quite well. We have migrated over 20,000 clients during the quarter, and now have almost 350,000 clients on this platform. We're on target to complete all small business migrations in fiscal 2015. We are also executing on our plan to move all of our mid-sized clients to ADP Workforce Now. We currently have more than 47,000 clients on this platform. We are on our way to complete these migrations in fiscal 2015 as well. We've been pleased with the upsell opportunities as a result of these migrations. Many of the clients we migrate to Workforce Now from a legacy standalone payroll platform sign up for one or more additional solutions, such as time and attendance, HR and benefits administration, or talent. Additionally, we're seeing notable improvement in retention rates for our clients on our newest platforms. And with that, I will now give the call back to Jan for a look at the quarter's financial highlights and the full year forecast. Jan Siegmund : Thank you, Carlos. ADP reported 7% revenue growth for the quarter, which was nearly all organic. Focusing on continuing operations, we achieved 6% growth in both pretax and net earnings and 7% earnings per share growth on fewer shares outstanding compared with 1 year ago. The quarter's results were as anticipated, and each of our business segments performing well. Employer Services grew total revenue 6%, PEO grew 15%, and Dealer grew 7%. In Employer Services, overall growth was good across-the-board. I do want to remind you that we anticipate a slower revenue growth in Employer Services as we entered into the second half of fiscal year, of this fiscal year, as a result of lower revenues from our tax credit services business that helps our clients receive certain employment-related tax credits. These revenues were lower than 1 year ago because a program that began in last year's third fiscal quarter has expired and has not been reviewed yet. As many of you know, our third fiscal quarter is an important retention period in our business, and I'm pleased that Employer Services' worldwide client revenue retention increased 80 basis points, bringing us to a 10 basis points improvement on a year-to-date basis on top of historically high retention rates. We are pleased to see continued strength in our same-store pays per control with Employer Services in the U.S., with an increase of 2.8%. However, in Europe, same-store pays per control declined 0.6% as anticipated. Although the decline has lessened throughout the fiscal year, the economy across Europe is still mixed. Average client fund balances were stronger than anticipated during the quarter, increasing 9%. Lower state unemployment tax rates were offset by increases from wage growth, including bonus payments by our clients; standalone tax filing; new business growth, especially in the small and mid-sized markets; as well as pays per control. The PEO had a strong quarter with 15% revenue growth, driven by 18% average worksite employee growth and strong revenue retention. Moving on to Dealer Services. Revenue growth was 7%, driven by new business installed and digital advertising revenues. Margin improvement benefited from nonrecurring items. I would now like to take you through a few of the items that negatively impacted ADP's earnings growth and margin expansion in the quarter. The decrease in high-margin revenues I spoke about a moment ago relating to certain employment tax credit programs we administer for our clients -- for our Employer Services clients, also created a year-over-year margin pressures. New bookings expense increased as anticipated from the strong bookings growth in the quarter. High-margin client fund interest revenues declined more than we anticipated due to lower interest rates, and the 10% increase in systems development and programming expense was higher than revenue growth and in line with our expectation. This increase is a result of our continued focus on innovation. Carlos gave some examples of these innovations in his opening remarks. And before we leave the discussion on the quarter's results, I want to point out that the decline in client interest revenues resulting from low-interest rates continues to be the most significant drag on ADP's result. ADP's revenue growth was muted almost 0.5 percentage points as the lower yields more than offset the benefit from the 9% growth in balances. Pretax margin was negatively impacted 60 basis points, and diluted earnings per share was lower by almost $0.02, or 2 percentage points, for the quarter Excluding this impact, it is evident that the leverage in ADP's business model is strong and intact. Now I will give you our updated full year forecast, which excludes any onetime expenses in connection with the Dealer Services spinoff and the results of discontinued operations as shown in this morning's press release. We are now anticipating revenue growth of about 8% for total ADP. We continue to anticipate slight pretax margin improvement for total ADP from 18.8% last year, which excludes the goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. We expect the effective tax rate will be about flat with fiscal year 2013's effective tax rate of 33.9%. We anticipate about 9% growth in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations compared with the $2.88 in fiscal year 2013, which excluded the goodwill impairment charge reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. As it is our normal practice, no further share buybacks are contemplated in the forecast beyond anticipated dilution related to employee equity comp plans, though it is clearly our intent to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders, depending on market conditions. And for all segments, in Employer Services, we continue to forecast revenue growth of about 7%, with pretax margin expansion of about 100 basis points. Consistent with our prior forecast, we are still anticipating an increase in our pays per control metric in the U.S. between 2% and 3%. For PEO Services, we are now forecasting about 14% revenue growth with slight pretax margin expansion. We continue to forecast about 8% growth in the dollar value of ES and PEO worldwide new business bookings from the $1.35 billion sold in fiscal year 2013. And for Dealer Services, we continue to forecast about 8% revenue growth with about 100 basis points of pretax margin expansion. We have narrowed our forecast for the client funds investment strategy, and the detail is available both in the press release and in the supplemental slides on our website, but I will provide the highlights. We anticipate client fund balances for fiscal year 2014 will be about $20.7 billion, which was -- represents about 8% growth. We anticipate a yield on the client funds portfolio of about 1.8%, down about 40 basis points from fiscal year 2013. We anticipate a year-over-year decline in client funds interest of $45 million to $50 million, and a decline of $55 million to $60 million for the total impact of the client funds investment strategy. And now, we also wanted to take a few minutes on the call today to talk with you about the expected impact of our client funds investment strategy on fiscal year 2015. Keeping in mind that we are still in our operating plan cycle and that these numbers are preliminary, our expectation is that the impact of the strategy to earnings will be about flat through fiscal year 2014, that is, these are adding to or subtracting from earnings. Let me walk you through the slide to provide a way for you to think about this for the purposes of your model. The chart on the left side of the slide should be familiar to most of you. Here, we show the detail of our client funds available for sale portfolios as of March 31, 2014, including the balances and the embedded interest yields for the remainder of fiscal year '14 and beyond. We included full year fiscal year '14 on this chart to give you some perspective on the rate pressure we continued to experience this year with an average embedded yield of 4% for the maturing balances compared with this year's average reinvestment rate of about 1.8%. For fiscal year 2015, based on current yield curves, we anticipate an average reinvestment rate of about 1.9%, which is still below the embedded rate of 2.7% for the securities that will mature during this fiscal year. This delta between the rates is not as wide as we have experienced over the past several years, and we believe that balance growth will help offset the rate pressure that we anticipate for fiscal year 2015. For illustrative purposes, because our forecasts for next year are not yet completed, we are assuming an increase in average client fund balances of about 5%, which at this point, in our operating plan process, is reasonable. We therefore, anticipate that the overall year-over-year impact in fiscal year 2015 from the client funds investment strategy will be about flat compared to the $55 million to $60 million drag we expect to experience this year. And remember, the interest earned in our investment portfolio flows into 2 separate lines of the earnings statement. The chart on the left represents ADP's client funds available for sale portfolio. The interest we earn on these portfolios is recorded as revenues on our earnings statement as interest on funds held for clients. With the exception of the interest earned from the extended portfolio on borrowing days, which is recorded as a portion of interest income on corporate funds within other income net. This is illustrated on the right-hand side of the slide. I hope this slide helps to make the point that both revenues and other income net are impacted by the client fund investment strategy for your modeling. And before we take your questions, I want to state that although our share repurchases in the quarter were less then you may have anticipated, ADP remains committed to returning cash to shareholders. We repurchased 0.5 million ADP shares in the quarter for a total cost of $42 million because we did not repurchase shares for a period of time prior to the announcement of the Dealer Services spinoff. Our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders has not lessened as a result of the spinoff. And I now turn it over to the operator to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question is from David Togut of Evercore. David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : It looks like ADP had its best quarter in quite some time. If I look at all of the leading metrics combined between client retention, new sales in ES and PEO and pays per control growth in the U.S., and you also seemed to be on track for this transition to run for small business and Workforce Now for mid-market by year end '15. So my question is, putting all these factors together, are you setting the stage for meaningful acceleration in revenue growth in ES once we get beyond FY '14? Carlos A. Rodriguez: So I think that -- I think, first of all, the first part of your comments, I think, are correct. We -- when you look at all the key metrics of our business, we're pretty pleased with the performance in the quarter. We obviously had some noise around this tax credit business and a couple of other items. But when you really look at the key metrics around retention, sales and all the kind of leading indicators, they really are very positive. Having said that, in terms of acceleration of revenue growth, I will just remind -- and I think you know this well that in a recurring revenue model, our ability to accelerate is really driven by the size of our sales number, and when we're able to start from that sales number, we're then subtracting what we lost for the year. So this improvement in retention and the acceleration in sales certainly accelerates our revenue growth. But, person's definition of meaningful acceleration in one business model versus in ours might be different. So just put in perspective, if you look at all the components that drive our revenue growth over multiple years -- I think we've given you these charts before -- we have things like price increase, which is a small item around 1%; we have pays per control growth, which is between 0.5% and 1%; we'll have some other noise factors. But the real key metric is what we call net new business, which is the difference between sales/starts and our losses. And we disclosed both of those numbers, so you can back into what our lost number is, and you can back into what our sales/starts number is. And I think if you roll that sales number forward and apply a reasonable growth rate of, call it, 8% to 10%, which is what we've been guiding to over several years, then you assume that retention will improve slightly as it has been, which we're very happy with. You do see acceleration in revenue growth, but I just want to temper the, I guess, the expectations with the sense that, that math is very, very clear in terms of how it works. And what we've been doing for the last 3-or-so years is adding anywhere between $50 million to $100 million in incremental net new business. And so now, the difference between that start number and that loss number is somewhere around, let's just say, it's between $500 million and $600 million. Right now, it's hovering around $600 million. You assume a $10 billion business in Employer Services, post-Dealer spin, then that gives you a sense of what's been happening to our organic growth rate. So it's been accelerating by somewhere between 0.5% and 1% over the last 3 years. And I think if you roll through that math, I think it gives you some sense of the sensitivity around what we need to do in terms of sales results and loss results and retention in order to kind of maintain that momentum with accelerating revenue growth. I hope that helps because I think it should be a positive message that we have been accelerating revenue growth, we're bullish about continuing to do that based on what we're seeing around retention and sales, but I just want to make sure that we temper expectations. David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : That was very helpful. Just a quick follow-up on that point. Given your comment about rising client retention around the transition to RUN and Workforce Now and the message you had today on more innovation on the way, would you expect client retention to continue to increase over the next couple years and sort of bolster this gradual acceleration, if you will, in ES organic revenue growth? Carlos A. Rodriguez: I happen to take a look at a chart of our retention last night over the last 10 years. And you always have to have the caveat of the economy because, in our small business division in particular, it is -- the retention rate there is somewhat sensitive to economic changes. So I believe that during the last downturn, our retention rates decreased by about 1%, mostly driven by economic factors, by the economic cycle. And then those retention rates came back by roughly 1% -- 1%, 1.2%, but close enough. And then the last 2 or 3 years, we bounced around a little bit and now have had what appears to be 2 years of 10 to 20 basis point improvements. When you look at our historical retention rates and how high they are across all the individual businesses and collectively, I would not factor in more than those types of modest improvements in retention. Because, even though, as the clients have been migrated, we've shown very good improvements in retention rates on those clients, again, just the way the math works, in of itself isn't alone to generate a, call it, 50 basis points improvement in retention year-over-year. And some of that is just related to the fact that some of our businesses are more sensitive to economic conditions, as an example, and we can't change economic conditions. So we expect the retention improvements to continue to help in this growth rate and in our net new business. But I think prudence will dictate that we're very, very careful because these retention rates that we're at now are at record levels through multiple economic cycles, although, obviously, we're doing things through innovation, through migrations and other things to hopefully continue to strengthen that retention. So that is clearly our hope and our expectation, but I would not be modeling more than what I would consider to be modest improvements in retention rates. Operator : The next question is from Smitti of Morgan Stanley. Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Your SG&A looked very good this quarter, and looked like it actually declined sequentially and on an absolute basis. Does that have to do with this discontinued business that you sold off, or is there something else there? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Well, if you break down -- because we typically look at it in categories, so if you look at our sales expense, it was quite strong this quarter because of our good sales. But our sales results vary from quarter-to-quarter, where there's some seasonality in sales and sales results, and hence our sales expense will vary with that seasonality. If you look at our investments in R&D, as Jan mentioned, they were up about 10%. So that category was strong. So really, in our core, call it, overhead expenses, is I think where we have fairly good cost controls. But I think some of what you're seeing is really seasonality around sales expense and other factors. Because if you look at our expenses as a percent of revenue, they're pretty in line with what we've been trending at and we're happy with. So we're, to be clear, trying to get operating leverage on our business through a variety of ways, including the migrations of our clients, which hopefully eventually, will add operating leverage. We're adopting some continuous improvement initiatives to try to drive operating leverage as well. But our goal, I think, long term has been to grow our pretax operating earnings at a slightly faster rate, call it, 2 to 3 percentage points faster than our revenue growth, which I think reflects slower growth in an operating expense than in revenue. And that's, of course, holding all other things constant because the pressure that we've had from interest rate has made that difficult when you look at it at ADP's bottom line. But excluding the pressure from interest rates and other noise, that's really our objective. And I think the quarter is reflective of that. Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Great. And maybe just a quick follow-up regarding the 14% growth in new business bookings. Can you help us parse it out, the growth in upmarket versus down market? Carlos A. Rodriguez: So I think, as we mentioned in our opening comments, we had really good improvement sequentially in our -- in what we call our National Accounts biz, let's call it. Upmarket for us includes National Accounts but also include some of our multinational solutions that we consider in that bucket of MNC. But -- so the overall category has shown really good sequential improvement. But, unfortunately, as we've been very clear and transparent about, we had a very difficult first quarter on the heels of a blowout fourth quarter last fiscal year. And so we see improvement both in terms of units, in terms of dollars, against previous year and against plans. So on every metric, we see what we expected, which is a recovery as we rebuilt our pipelines and we resolved some of our execution issues in our upmarket business. Having said that, the reason we're being cautious is that -- I just mentioned that part of our problem in the first quarter was our blowout fourth quarter last year, particularly in National Accounts, that we're about -- we're now actually in the middle of the fourth quarter that now has to grow over that blowout fourth quarter. So we had a very, very difficult grow over, but on a normalized basis, we feel that we've recovered in our upmarket business and that the momentum is good. We mentioned in our comments that our Vantage sales were up over the previous year, and I think we're pleased with. We sold a number of Workforce Now deals in the low end of National Accounts, large increase over the previous year. That's a strong competitive offering against some competitors in the low end of our National Accounts business. So we think things are, I think, progressing as we expected and as we mentioned, which was a recovery that would take a couple of quarters as a result of rebuilding our pipelines and addressing our execution issues. But unfortunately, now we face this very difficult fourth quarter grow-over. Operator : The next question is from Jim MacDonald of First Analysis. James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division : You talked about how Dealer would be free to pursue their new strategies as a standalone company. How about core ADP? What new strategies might you be able to do now that -- once you're a separate company and just focused on employer-type services? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Well, I think that -- this was really not about changing ADP's strategy but about creating more focus on it. And so it really -- we don't really have any ulterior motives or any other secret weapons at our disposal, other than, obviously, we have now more financial flexibility post spinoff. But we -- our desire, I think, the board's view was that focusing my attention and my entire management team's attention on what we believe is a very large global opportunity in Human Capital Management was the appropriate thing to do. And by the way, they thought the same thing about Dealer because they have a very capable, very experienced team there that has the same views about the retail automotive market that we have about Human Capital Management. And so, I think, this is really about focus and about freeing up, I think, energy and attention of the 2 management teams. There really isn't any other -- we don't -- you shouldn't anticipate or expect a shift in direction here with the post-spin ADP. If anything, you're going to see a much more focused and, I think, determined competitor in the HCM world. Because this is -- ADP will be Employer Services, and we will be HCM. James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division : And for my technical followup, PEO grew dramatically in the quarter, although it looks like you put on a lot of those employees late in the quarter. Could you talk a little bit about how that's panning out and if that had an impact on margins in the quarter, things like that? Carlos A. Rodriguez: It did have an impact on margins because the -- and I think the item you mentioned about the works [ph] employees coming on towards the end of the quarter, that happens every year, such a seasonal issue just because of what's called tax restarts and other factors in the PEO. So that a large number of the new starts, and sales of starts are actually equal to each other in the PEO business. That is very typical in that business. The margin impact on the business was as a result of the PEO having those strong sales results. Obviously, our commission expense and our sales expense increase when we have very strong sales results. And the sales results were, to say strong is an understatement in the quarter for the PEO. And, hence, our sales expense was quite strong as well or high, so that created a decrease in the PEO's margin versus the prior year, which obviously had some negative impacts on ADP's margins for the quarter as well overall. But we're happy with that. Just let me add, we love all of our businesses to have that much growth in sales because back to the very first question we got, it actually would accelerate this revenue growth. Jan Siegmund : And just a friendly reminder, of course, the accelerated growth of the PEO has also growing at a good clip. Our pass-through revenues in the PEO that are part of this PO revenues and those on low-margin revenues that as a mechanical consequence, also, put margin pressure onto our overall ADP results. Carlos A. Rodriguez: That's a great point. That's why, I think to Jan's point, we -- as you look at our 10-Q and you look at the comments we make to you, I think it's prudent to really look at the segment reporting as well as the overall ADP results for that very reason. Operator : The next question is from Sara Gubins of Bank of America. Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Could you talk about how you're thinking about potential client migration for existing clients onto the Vantage platform? I know this hasn't been an area of focus, but I'm wondering if it might become more so? Carlos A. Rodriguez: So it's a great question because we were with 1,000 clients just a few weeks ago at our Meeting of the Minds event, and we had the same question from a number of clients. So we're doing 2 things to address that. One is we're increasing our investment to increase our capacity to be able to do migrations, and we've done a few already. But, clearly, in theory, we have probably demand for hundreds of those types of migration. So we're doing 2 things. One is investing in that capacity to make sure that we can do migrations at a pace that's responsive to our clients' needs or our clients' desires. And also to block competitors from trying to take business from us, which has been a very effective part of our migration strategy in the low end and in mid market. The second thing that we're doing besides adding capacity for migrations is we are making some, what I would call modest investments from a technology innovation standpoint on our existing enterprise platform, which we gave a preview of at ADP -- at the Meeting of the Minds gathering. That was extremely well received because, frankly, in the upmarket space, there are many clients who aren't necessarily -- there are some that are lining up to migrate, and there's many that aren't because transitions can be disruptive, expensive, et cetera, to their own business, and it may just not be one of their business priorities. So them seeing that we're willing to invest in the short to medium term in our enterprise platform to give them a lot of the same capabilities from a look and feel and experience standpoint that we're providing on Vantage, which is very, very well received. So we're, we're frankly excited about that, and we think that it -- I guess, to put it bluntly, buys us time to be able to execute on these migrations to Vantage over the next several years. Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : And then just as a follow-up, are you seeing any change in the pricing environment? And I'm wondering, when you lose clients to competitors, has pricing ever been given as the reason? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Yes. It definitely -- we track, obviously, our -- very carefully, where our clients go in terms of losses and then the reason codes, whether they're related to service or product issues in terms of feature functionality or price, et cetera. And again, we look at those numbers literally every month very, very carefully. And we really haven't seen other than right after the economic downturn -- so going into the economic downturn, was a very large increase in price reasons for clients terminating. And then once we came out of the economic downturn, that went down as a reason. And now it's been stable. We really don't see any major -- and part of this is probably just because of our size because it's a large sample. But there's really nothing exciting to report. We really don't -- and I don't know if Jan has anything to add, but it just doesn't seem like there's anything there in terms of changes. Jan Siegmund : No. Carlos is exactly right. The mix of factors that clients indicate when they leave ADP has been stable, and also our discounting in new sales has been stable. So the pricing environment has been, overall, kind of stable for a number of quarters and a couple of years, I would even say. The net impact is that we are realizing about 1% of revenue growth for price increases on prices overall and new businesses coming in at bigger rates and really very stable pricing environment. Carlos A. Rodriguez: And part of our -- let me just add, a part of our approach around HCM is not necessarily to try to drive price at the individual payroll level, but it's really to add additional solutions that we think help our clients solve business problems and help them manage their people better, but also, frankly, create more revenue for us. So we gave you examples of, for example, as we migrate clients, and even as we sell new clients, the typical attach rates in terms of the number of modules that we sell is definitely higher than in our legacy client base. I think that helps us a lot from a \"pricing standpoint\" if you consider pricing to be unit based. But it's not really pricing, per se, and it's not a competitive issue in terms of making us uncompetitive because what we're doing is we're selling more things and more solutions and just getting higher dollars per client or per unit. So that's our preference from a pricing standpoint rather than trying to drive price increase, if you will. Operator : And the next question is from Gary Bisbee of Royal Bank of Canada. Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : And I should say, congratulations on the decision to spin those -- the Dealer business. I guess, on that topic, can you give us an update within the Dealer business, what's the mix of the core DMS software offering versus digital marketing? And how should we think about what's been going on in terms of growth rates in those 2 parts of the business and how the profitability differs from one to the other? Jan Siegmund : Yes. Gary, at this point in time, we're really not updating more and publicizing more detail about the revenue mix and growth rates. We leave that to the filing and then the roadshow as we prepare at Dealer Services. You're aware that Dealer Services has 3 components, or 2 components, really, of major businesses, that's the traditional dealer management systems business, that's the core Dealer Services. And we added, through the acquisition of Cobalt, a meaningful business to the Digital Marketing capabilities. Those are the 2 major businesses that one should think about Dealer Services. And you will see probably end of May, beginning of June, when we file, you will see the segment reporting. Carlos A. Rodriguez: And I think just to help a little bit, we -- I think there were some public comments or filings about the revenues of Cobalt at the time of the acquisition. I think if you apply a reasonable growth rate to those, you'll get close to what you're looking for in terms of the mix. But I think, as Jan said, we're obviously going to be providing a lot more detail. Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : How about just sort of a higher-level commentary. When we try to think about the cash flow generation of the HR businesses relative to dealer capital spending levels or tax rate, but it's probably too early on that one. But can you give us just a high-level thought the business is similar, is one much better, one worse on capital efficiency, cash flow generation? Any other commentary, that would be great. Carlos A. Rodriguez: I think that those businesses are exceptional in terms of their profile around capital usage on a normal ongoing basis, if you will. So the only factor that would change that equation is really what I would call voluntary decisions about acquisitions. But if you look at the businesses in terms of their need for capital, they're very, very similar even though the Dealer Services business has some nuances in a couple of areas in terms of our international business having a little bit more licensing fees versus recurring revenues. But when you would put it all together, the businesses are very, very similar, which is why we held this business for so long and why it's been so good to us. It's -- we share a lot of DNA. This was not -- even though they're different industries and one is very focused on automotive retail and the other one is HCM, which is part of why we're making the separation, the separation is not because of the underlying dynamics or performance of either business because the Dealer business has been performing quite well. So to put it, I guess, in plain English, I think the cash flow generation capability of Dealer on a relative basis is almost the same as Employer Services : very low capital expenditure requirement; very good margin, which by the way is very similar to the ADP -- overall ADP margins. So if you start off with \"net income\" and you add back depreciation and amortization and you go through all the normal working capital changes, I know you're going to see, on a smaller scale obviously adjusted for size, a very, very similar picture in terms of cash flow generation capability. Then the decision comes down to, do you do other things like capital expenditures that can utilize, I think, capital, more or less. And again, over the years, we've had times where Dealer has been -- has made a number of acquisitions. There's other times where Employer Services have made a number of acquisitions. So that part is a little bit harder to pin down. But that's going to be up to the Dealer Services management team and their Board of Directors. Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Great. And then the follow-up question, you talked an awful lot about the new platforms across RUN and Workforce Now and Vantage. You haven't talked a lot about changes in technology and platform within the PEO business. Obviously, that continues to be a terrific grower. But can you give us just sort of a high-level sense of how that's evolved over time, and if the offerings within the bundled solution there have changed a lot in recent years? And ultimately, I'm just trying to think through the continued competitiveness of that business? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Very good question that Jan asked me about a year ago about -- as we talked about modernizing and migrating and so forth, the PEO has really been using the same underlying platform for a while now. The difference with the PEO or perhaps why it may not be -- it's important, but why we are in a slightly different place is the co-employment model creates a much different level of touch point with the client in the sense that we're highly engaged in the clients' HR decisions. We're highly engaged in their benefits decisions, not just the technology, but in the decisions themselves. We actually provide them the insurance products around workers' compensation and healthcare. So it's just a much broader, bigger relationship. Having said all that, the employees of the clients in the PEO, which are now, obviously, over 300,000, have the same desire to have the same experience they had with their online banking. We mentioned that in our opening comments that the consumer experience at the employee level is still important and even at the practitioner level. So in response to that, even though we haven't change the fundamental underlying platform itself, we have made some fairly significant improvements and investments in the user experience, both at the employee level -- worksite employee level and at the practitioner level. And we saw a demo of that in one of my staff meetings just a few months ago, and it was quite impressive. And particularly around items related to healthcare reform and ACA, they're probably on a leading edge of providing tools to both the clients and to the employees to deal with kind of the new regulations and to actually comply with those regulations. Operator : The next question is from David Grossman of Stifel Financial. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Carlos, if you look back over time, that AAA rating has been an important element, maybe important is an overstatement, but an element of ADP's branding. And I assume there were both advantages and constraints imposed on your business as a result of that. Can you help us better understand what the tradeoff, if any, as you move forward, as you think about the change in rating in terms of both positive and negative that may be an outcome of that? Carlos A. Rodriguez: I'll give you a couple of thoughts there, and I'll let Jan take a crack at it because he's done a very effective job in communicating with our external constituents about that topic, so he's given a lot of thought and talked to a lot of people about it as well. But to be clear, and I think Jan has made this clear as well, we were obviously -- we were aware that we were going to have a potential change in our rating as a result of what we consider to be a strategic decision. Over the years, we have come across other strategic opportunities, for example, whether they be acquisitions that -- and we've never looked at large multi-year dilutive acquisitions. But when you look at a larger acquisition, even if it's in the HCM space, if it requires taking on a modest amount of debt, that would've also led to a change in rating. So we've had those discussions over the course of several years and always came to the conclusion, and the board, I think, recommended that we not discard our credit rating for the sake of discarding it because we were proud of it, and we enjoyed the publicity, if you will, of being 1 of 4 AAA-rated companies. Having said that, the board and my predecessor and his predecessor were always very clear with you and with everyone that for the right strategic transaction, we didn't believe that it was worth not doing a strategic transaction in order to preserve AAA rating because it was largely a source of pride and not a source of financial advantage. So those there's no change in our -- we obviously don't have any debt, so it doesn't change our borrowing costs. And even if we do borrow at some point in the future, at least today, the debt cost of between AAA and AA is nonexistent. And so when you look at the full picture together, it was not a decision that we took lightly. It was a decision that we obviously thought about a lot, spoke with the board about, Jan and I spent a lot of time discussing, but this was the right thing to do because we think it's the right thing to do long term for ADP and for Dealer Services. And at least so far, our expectation has been proven out, which is that we're managing really a public relations issue rather than a financial or real issue because it has no impact on our business when you really get down to it other than potentially a positive impact of creating more financial flexibility for us down the road. So Jan, I don't know if you have any... Jan Siegmund : I think you covered really the vast majority of it. After the spin, we did survey, of course, our sales force and inquired about the potential client reaction, the impact, and there was none. So really, even the public relations impact from being \"downgraded\" was nonexistent from what our sales force experienced. So I think, overall, the outcome for ADP is a better place, more financial flexibility for us strategically in the future and our business model being intact. But for all the things that we need to do relative to the client fund and Money Movement operations where credit rating does play a role and the AA is perfectly wonderful rating for that is we monetized our opportunities here I think in a good way. Carlos A. Rodriguez: And I think you also -- well, you should hear that -- as you have seen that our commitment to our fortress balance sheet has not changed. And so even though we have more financial flexibility going forward, part of what we represent in terms of our industry is really we're still highly differentiated in terms of our ability to move more than $1.4 trillion through our Money Movement systems. The importance of credibility, the importance of the relationships we have with tax agencies and with the IRS, these are all very, very important things to us that we're never going to compromise on. So the credit rating is one thing, but I think our commitment to our financial principles and how we run our company in order to be able to make good on all these commitments to both our clients and also to all the agencies that we work with has obviously not changed. And again, competitively, if I were one of our competitors, this would not be one of the items I would focus on in the sales call because, obviously, we would -- we welcome those discussions either in a AAA or a AA any day. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Understood. And I know that this has come up in a couple of other questions, but the PEO obviously saw significant growth in both revenue and worksite employees. And you've talked about the Affordable Care Act in the past and that potential impact on the business and weren't quite sure how that would exactly play out. But do you have any better insight into what are some of the specific drivers right now that are creating some acceleration in growth in that business? Carlos A. Rodriguez: The PEO really acts as a -- and always has, so this is nothing different, acts as a large employer for the purposes of healthcare and workers' compensation, and that's part of the value proposition is that you create scale in purchasing, in distribution, in administration of a lot of services. So not just HR services and benefits administration payroll but also on the products themselves, the healthcare and the workers' compensation. So that has been the formula since ADP has been in the PEO business. So that has not changed. Acting as a large employer of providing healthcare benefits to what are really client employees, if you will, at a sub-level, we have thousands of clients, obviously, that are part of our PEO business, creates an advantage, if you will, from a purchasing standpoint because our cost of healthcare we're purchasing on a large scale. And as a large employer, these are the small businesses we're having to purchase individual small business policies. So there has always been some theoretical advantage because there's also other drivers that drive cost of healthcare like your experience. Like do you have high losses, do you have low losses, the demographics of the age and makeup of the workforce. So there are lots of other factors that drive the cost of healthcare as well. But this issue around buying either as a large employer or a small employer has always been a factor, but it's been magnified by healthcare reform as new regulations and new rules have been imposed and new price controls have been imposed on small business policies and small business pricing. So that's really where some of the competitive differentiation for the PEO, I think, has come from, where it has improved. But again, we're very proud and we're very happy with the acceleration. And there's no question it's an acceleration. But I just want to point out that this business has been performing well for a decade and has had double-digit worksite employee growth in the past as a result of the same factors that we're talking about today. But clearly, they've been amplified as a result of healthcare reform. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : I see. And perhaps if I could just get one more in. You brought up this -- the idea that you were working on expanding capacity for conversions. Could you just, perhaps, elaborate on how that impacts the competitive dynamic in retention? I think you mentioned that. I was just hoping to clarify that quickly. Carlos A. Rodriguez: I think I was speaking really about the upmarket space, and I think it was in reaction to a question about we're making progress on low end, on the mid market, and I think someone was asking about what about the upmarket since we were not talking about that a lot. And so as a reaction really to the question about the upmarket, we have very large investments in our upmarket migrations already as we've been for several years moving clients from one version of enterprise to our latest version of enterprise. And I was really only alluding to the fact that we, as a result of demand, that we've heard from clients, both at Meeting of Minds but otherwise, that we feel we need to expand that capacity to be able to migrate clients not just to new versions of enterprise but also to Vantage. So wish I had more detail to report on that, but there's really -- I don't think you should expect any -- this was not intended as a major announcement competitively. This was about just kind of moderate, modest increases that are already significant capacity to National Accounts to migrate clients, and we can also migrate some Vantage clients as well. Operator : And the next question is from George Mihalos of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Carlos, you mentioned an opportunity to upsell or cross-sell clients as you convert them to the newer platforms and sort of increase the revenue per client. Is there a way we can sort of think about that across the different segments? Is it x number of modules that you generally have on the legacy platform and now with the transition it's increased by 2 or 3 modules or maybe a 3% or 4% or 5% increase in revenue per client. Any sort of color you can provide there? Jan Siegmund : Yes, I'll answer this. The newest example we can give is for our mid-market migrations that clients migrating onto Workforce Now platform. And I think I talked about in prior calls about it. We have seen really 2 sources of improvements. Number one is clients buying in the process of converting and clients staying longer is the second source of improvement of lifetime value of the client, if you like. And the numbers have been now fairly stable over the last few quarters. So I think I can be pretty, pretty precise with you. Where about 30% of clients that convert buy additional modules, about 1/3 of the clients, so to speak. And it happens within the timeframe of the migration plus/minus a couple of months or so. And when they do so, the overall revenue base of our migrated clients is about 15% higher than it was before. And clients have several percentage points of retention improvement compared to the old platform that they were on, which is lower than the average of our clients. So you see really driving about 15% more revenue, 30% of the clients choose and -- retention improving. Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. Is it safe to assume that the impact from RUN is somewhat lower than that? Jan Siegmund : Yes, it is because the most important loss driver for RUN is still downmarket, out of business and economic, general economic reasons. So you'll see, in retention, we have not seen -- we have seen retention improving in SBS gradually, and certainly RUN is contributing to that, but it's not as pronounced as we have seen it in the mid market. And we have a fairly stable mix of HR components that we cross-sell into the businesses. And I would more describe it that we had that for a while. You could buy EasyPay off a legacy platform in -- with richer HR bundles before, and you can do that on RUN, too. And I believe we have a mix of clients that is already optimally penetrated, so to speak, because not all clients need really more comprehensive HR solutions. If you're a 1- or 2-person company, you may not want to choose for that. So the mix and the downmarket, we feel, is already very good. So we didn't see missed upsell opportunities, so to speak. So we think of the RUN conversion is more revenue neutral. Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And then just last question. You guys spoke about some more flexibility on the financial side post the Dealer spin. Does that change your attitude towards employing debt on the balance sheet? And does that change at all your thoughts around the pace of M&A or the size of potential M&A transactions? Carlos A. Rodriguez: I don't -- I think, again, given the discussions we've had with our board over the last several years, I think the answer to that has to be no because we've never felt constrained. But it is -- it's also not fair to say that it's a nonissue or nonevent because it was a distraction. So we had the AAA, if you will, monkey on our back, although we were very happy to have it, but it was a monkey on our back. And it was something that came up as a result of discussions around strategic transactions, be they slightly larger acquisitions that required employing [ph] a little bit of debt or just employing debt as a way of optimizing the capital structure of the company. So it's just not -- again, I'm obviously in those discussions, and it's just not -- it's never been a constraint. If we felt that there was something like we just did with Dealer Services that would add value long term to ADP, the board was always willing to do it. Having said all that, I think it's -- the reason I say more financial flexibility is, I don't know if it's a 5% or 10% increase in flexibility, but there's some improvement in flexibility because there's really going to not be that obstacle, if you will, of that monkey being on our back anymore. Operator : And the next question is from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Ryan Cary - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : This is Ryan Cary calling in for Jason. Hate to beat a dead horse on the PEO growth but, obviously, it's accelerated the past 4 quarters. Just want to be clear, are you actually taking share, or is something really happening to the market that's just increasing the overall size of the pie? Carlos A. Rodriguez: That industry is very difficult to get good, reliable data on because there are only -- I think now, there are a couple of public companies. There used to be only one. But it is difficult. There is an association that provides some data. I think based on what we see from the industry association and based on other information that we have, we believe we're gaining market share. Ryan Cary - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay, great. And just quickly, I know we're running over here a little bit. I don't believe you have any exposure to Russia and Ukraine. I just wanted to doublecheck on that. And I'd also love just a little more commentary on Europe and the climate. I know it's been a drag the last couple of quarters. I believe it improved modestly this quarter, but just kind of your thoughts on the outlook. Jan Siegmund : Yes, so we have no exposure to Russia and the Ukraine. And the European business environment has been more difficult for us compared to the U.S. Just a reminder, there is still revenue growth in Europe, it's just below the average of ADP's growth. So we have seen an ever-so-slight improvement in the pays per control metric quarter-over-quarter. And a couple of countries, and those are the countries that you hear in the press, are improving. We see that the same way. The Germany and U.K., and we're having a good year in -- better year in France. So we see slight improvements, but the pays per control are still declining. So it is a relative easing of the pressure that we see. We had -- we continue to enjoy good retention rates in this market. And so it is just that slow-growth environment. I would -- we anticipated the question around the international economic environment, and it's really just a gradual, ever-so-slight improvement that we wanted to communicate. I don't think it's a great change [indiscernible] change that we are seeing at this point in time. Operator : The next question is from Matthew O'Neill of CLSA. Matthew O'Neill - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division : I had a quick question, following up, I know we've talked a lot about retention this morning. I was curious, do you guys just look at retention or think about retention as having a theoretical maximum that's actually below 100%, which you sort of discussed this morning being attributable to the economy here, to the business consolidations or things like that, as far as a target that you work for or just getting your clients at 100% satisfaction and then what is unfortunately lost that's completely out of your control? Just wondering if you could discuss that. Carlos A. Rodriguez: Sure. The -- and we'll prepare for the next time to have more detail around actual numbers. But clearly, given everything we've said, the theoretical maximum is not 100%. So I'll use an example of this. In the downmarket, I think Jan alluded to it, in the low end, approximately half of our losses are really related to companies just going out of business. So you've seen all the stories and the publications about how the amount of turnover in small businesses is quite high, which is just part of the way America works. People start businesses and many of them fail and many of them are successful. And so there's a good close to 10 percentage points of losses in that low end -- between 8 and 10 percentage points of losses that are, what we call, uncontrollable, where either bankruptcy or they just stopped processing because they go out of business, they just close down. Some of these are not even formal bankruptcies because they're just sole proprietorships and they just stop doing whatever services they are doing. So that alone, the SBS theoretical maximum being somewhere in the low-90s at best, obviously, factors into ADP's overall ability to achieve 100%, and that, obviously, brings it down to somewhere lower than 100%. I don't know if it's 97% or 98%, but we'll do the math and get that for you. And then in the mid market, you have the same phenomenon, but in a much smaller scale, obviously. There are some number of companies in mid market that are uncontrollable losses, bankruptcy, out of business. But it's a smaller number because their business clients are between 50 and 1,000 employees. And the level of failure rate in that segment of the market is much, much lower than in the low end of the market. And you get into National Accounts, and there you have, obviously, almost no failures, but you still have things that we consider to be somewhat uncontrollable like, for example, a consolidation, so a large National Account client buys another National Account client. If that client that's the acquirer happens to be an ADP client, it's a happy day for us because we get a new client as a result of the acquisition. If it's not an ADP client, then we have to go into a sales cycle. We have to go convince the acquirer to give us both combined companies rather than just the company that's being acquired. And so we'll get more detail, more color for you. But clearly, the theoretical maximum is not 100%, and it varies between 8 to 10 percentage points of uncontrollable losses in Small Business to probably somewhere between 0% and 3% in our National Accounts business, and then mid market is obviously somewhere in between. But having said all that, it's very clear to us, as we see -- we look at this data very, very carefully, but without having done the math specifically for you, we have a lot of room to improve retention still that's controllable for us. The reason that we're cautious and careful about expectations is you have to do a lot as you have to improve your products that they be easier to use, you have to have better service, you have to be competitive on price. A lot of factors that go into driving that number up, and it's not one simple lever that also is going to generate another 100 basis point improvement in retention. The reason we say that with confidence is that we have, unfortunately, years and years of history that tells us to be careful and cautious about from here, today, how much room we have in terms of additional improvement in retention. But believe me, we're driving towards that. We're happy with the quarter. We're happy with the year. And we hope to keep getting it because it helps a lot with our growth rate. Operator : The next question is from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Just I guess I wanted to ask on the -- maybe I'll start with the SaaS payroll question. A couple of new companies have come public. I know there's a lot of PEO questions, but just on SaaS, given how those stocks are trading, I'm curious if that changes your appetite to acquire similar players or similar technologies. Carlos A. Rodriguez: We're pretty happy with our own technologies, as you probably could tell, on our new -- certainly, on our new platforms. So no, it doesn't. I mean, we're -- again, we're always open to using our capital for the best interest of our shareholders, including acquisitions. But we don't feel -- we don't have a compelling need right now to buy technology or to buy platforms. We have a compelling need to accelerate our migrations and to sell more of what we already have. Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. I figured that was the case, just wanted to make sure, Carlos. And then just beyond -- I just want to clarify on the guidance, you muted the high end of the revenue range but to the midpoint of EPS. Is the difference just the discontinued operations, or is it also the slower buyback and the rate outlook change? Jan Siegmund : No, the guidance does not contemplate the buybacks, the incremental buybacks above revenue dilution. And the guidance also excludes the disc ops as well as the onetime cost that we anticipate in the fourth quarter for the Dealer spin. So this is really the true continued operations number that we guide towards. Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Right. So it's just -- you're just a little bit firmer, I guess, just on earnings... Jan Siegmund : That's the rest of the year, and we have really only 1 quarter left. We felt it was -- versus the true disclosure, I narrowed our guidance to what we see, and that will be appropriate to help you guys a little bit. Operator : The next question is from Mark Marcon of Robert W. Baird. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : I was wondering if you could discuss a little bit more about what was truly exciting at the Meeting of the Minds conference in terms of future functionality with regards to the improvements in Vantage, and how quickly will those be available broadly? Carlos A. Rodriguez: We just recently had a recent release of Vantage that I think adds some great enhancement done [ph] up from a feature functionality standpoint. But the really exciting part at Meeting of the Minds was sharing the new user experience, which the ADP Innovation Labs folks that we now have working out of New York City, obviously, have made -- and also here in Roseland, New Jersey, have obviously contributed to that. And we did -- which is again different for us. We did an on-stage demo that Mike Capone and Mark Benjamin did for all of the clients and some prospects of what that new user experience was going to be. And as we mentioned in our comments, it's going to be available in the early fall. And that really was probably the most exciting part of the meeting because it showed not only our commitment to usability and user experience both at the practitioner level but also at the employee level because now we have more employees of our clients touching our products than we have clients and practitioners just because of the nature of how our business has changed. And so I think the clients and prospects see that as a huge positive because if we leave them the administrative work, people can easily and intuitively handle all of their HR administrative needs and, by the way, do some things that help them in terms of managing their own work life. For example, in the demo, it showed how someone can go through an open enrollment to choose their benefits and how, because we have payroll information and time information because we have the entire HCM platform, how on a single screen on one dashboard, the employee can see how a change in the healthcare choices affects their take-home pay, affects their taxes, affects all other aspects of their work life, if you will. And so I personally thought that, that was the most exciting moment and where I think we got the most buzz is when people saw that we're really committed to this technology innovation from a user experience standpoint because I believe that from a feature functionality standpoint that we already are pretty robust in terms of being able to deliver solutions around tax compliance and all the regulatory challenges that our clients experience. And we've been doing that for a very, very long time. Jan Siegmund : I add one component to it that the user experience now includes also the leverage of our data. So not only the scope of the products that we are able to integrate into the user experience but also the size and number of companies that we can include and offer now a benchmark and advice to either employees or managers on how to make their decisions. So we're really leveraging our data analytics in a very practical and intuitive way to the benefit of the employees. So kind of trying to build really what we have been talking for the last couple of years, sources of data, our social capabilities, the source that we have so many employees on our platforms and translating it into very tangible values that you experience when you are on our platform. Carlos A. Rodriguez: It's a brighter visual since Jan only gets more excited about it. As I remember the moment, not only do -- does the employee see the impact on the change on their paycheck right away and can do what ifs, if you will, on the screen. But to Jan's point, as they're choosing the different healthcare plans, our data actually will recommend to them or will tell them, in fact, using social and using Amazon-like ratings, if you will, they will say, the majority of the employees in your situation at your pay level, with your number of dependents, pick this health plan. There are these other 2 or 3 choices, but this is the one that is most often chosen and, by the way, here are the ratings from other employees of multiple companies of these different healthcare plans. So it's very, very powerful, I think, use of data and analytics. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : That sounds like a very material improvement. As we think about just the fourth quarter new sales and you have this big grow over target, is there a possibility that some clients will hold off on making any decisions and just wait until this is broadly available? Carlos A. Rodriguez: We -- that's really not our intention. And it's not what our -- what has been our historical experience. So our salespeople, we've obviously been through this before where we have new products roll out, and we have enhancements to our products, so in our large account business, these cycles are very long sales cycles. And so people typically don't stop making decisions or don't start making decisions because of specific product feature functionality or technology available. And it's not been, I think, our prior experience. So we're not -- we didn't see that in this quarter. Obviously, our sales were very strong. And we don't expect that to be the case because we have, I think, obviously, incentives in place, both for our sales folks but also for our clients because we want to get, obviously, them contracted as soon as possible. And when we implement them or when we start them, I mean, we, today, for example, would be happy to sell a National Account client for a fall implementation or even a January 1 implementation because that sale cycle takes that long. So frankly, given the timing of the announcement, I don't think it has any impact on our sales in terms of slowing our sales. That wasn't the intention. It was intended to actually accelerate our sales. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Great. And then with regards to the -- to Wati [ph], how much was that impact? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Well, the Wati [ph] impact is, I think it's a little, I would say, maybe half a basis -- 50 basis points or so, roughly. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : 50 bps. Okay. Great. And then with regards to just the gaining share in the PEO side, what's the primary driver do you think that's driving the share gains? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Well, I mean, frankly, based on the data that I see, excluding acquisitions, we've been gaining market share for 10 years. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : I know. I'm one of the few people who follow that other competitor. But what do you think is driving it in an accelerating rate right now? Carlos A. Rodriguez: All right, just to be clear, I'm not picking on one competitor because I wasn't referring to any one competitor. I'm talking about the entire -- because I look at the entire industry. There are plenty of other competitors, and there's a lot of acquisition activity and a lot of available data, even though most of them are private. And my comment was, I think, was across-the-board, not any specific competitor. But I wish I could tell you more other than, clearly, they're getting some help from the concern people have around ACA and healthcare reform. But also, again, my personal view is that the business is executing really well. I mean, they've done some really great and innovative things even on the sales side over the last 2 or 3 years. So again, unrelated necessarily to ACA and to healthcare reform, but just around the value proposition and how we sell and also how we get and generate leads from our partners in major accounts and in SBS. So I think we've had great sales leadership there for several years and I think great general management leadership, where these investments that they've made in the user experience and in technology without, again, changing the underlying platform, but I think the presentation of the experience to the employees and the clients has been enhanced significantly. And then there's been some good old-fashioned improvement, if you will, from a continuous improvement standpoint in just processes in terms how open enrollment is conducted, how new businesses -- how new clients are implemented. So I think they've just had great execution, and I think they have some help now from the market in terms of healthcare reform. Operator : And the next question is from Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets Canada : This is actually Henry Chien calling on behalf of Jeff. Just a quick one from me. About margin guidance for ES, just want to doublecheck that nothing has changed. Does it continue to be driven by sales productivity in the migration clients? Carlos A. Rodriguez: I'm sorry, can you repeat that again? The margin question on ES was... Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets Canada : In terms of your guidance for margin expansion to ES? Carlos A. Rodriguez: No, I think if you see our -- I believe we included in the press release that our guidance is consistent with our prior guidance, if I'm not mistaken. So I'm just reading through... Elena Charles : Yes, I think you were thinking that it was due to the migrations and sales efficiencies. There's also a lot of operating efficiencies going on. I wouldn't attribute it to migrations at this point. Carlos A. Rodriguez: So again, to be clear, our guidance, I think, what we stated in the press release, which was consistent from our guidance -- consistent with our guidance for the entire year is a pretax margin expansion of about 100 basis points. And so that would include both the negative impact of migration and sales costs but also positives of what Elena was referring to, as we're obviously doing a lot of things to try to get more efficient and better at what we do. Operator : At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos A. Rodriguez: Well, thanks very much for joining us today. As you can tell, we're very pleased with our results for the quarter. You can also tell that we're obviously still very committed to our shareholder-friendly actions around dividends and share buybacks, notwithstanding the delay in buybacks as a result of the waiting for the announcement for Dealer Services. Over the next couple months, we're obviously going to be working very diligently, and there's a lot of people putting a lot of effort, a lot of hard work to getting the spinoff of Dealer Services completed, and we're going to update you along the way about our progress. I hope you share my enthusiasm for Dealer's feature, as well as ADP's future, given that the transaction is going to free Dealer to focus on their own industry while, obviously, highlighting our commitment to being the global leader in human capital management. I think that the transaction is going to position both companies for great future and strong growth. And again, we thank you for joining us this quarter. We look forward to seeing you -- talking to you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I'll now introduce your host for today's conference, Elena Charles, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Elena Charles : Thank you. I'm here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2014 Earnings Call and Webcast. Carlos will begin today's call with an overview of our key achievements during fiscal 2014 and a discussion about our financial results. He will then provide a high-level update on the status of the spin-off of Dealer Services. Next, Jan will then provide further information regarding the spin-off before taking you through our detailed financial results and our fiscal 2015 forecast. Finally, before we take your questions, Carlos will provide some closing remarks. I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events, and as such, involve some risks. These are also discussed in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Carlos. Carlos A. Rodriguez: Thank you, Elena. Fiscal 2014 can best be described as a year of innovation at ADP. From increasing the speed with which we bring new solutions to market, to opening ADP's second Innovation Lab, this latest one located in Manhattan, where we develop the new technologies that change the way businesses manage their human capital, to designing new solutions that focus on both our intuitive user experience and solid performance, fiscal 2014 has been a year of innovation at ADP. ADP is happy to enjoy a market-leading position with our Mobile Solutions app. In fiscal 2014, we more than doubled the number of people using our mobile app, passing the 2.5 million user mark. This growth shows that the way people prefer to manage their personal HR needs closely mirrors how they choose to shop, bank and connect via their mobile devices. We've exceeded our own expectations for fiscal 2014 client migrations. We successfully migrated almost 100,000 existing clients in the small and mid-market to our newest cloud-based platforms. This brings the total number of businesses that currently benefit from ADP's cloud-based solutions to over 430,000. ADP now has more than 50,000 clients enjoying our HCM platforms, Workforce Now and Vantage, compared with 40,000 a year ago. Through the globalization of our solutions, we are making it easier for clients to manage employee populations across borders. For example, our solutions are now offered in countries that are home to virtually all employees who work for multinational corporations. And as we increased strategic investments and innovation, we simultaneously managed our internal operations to achieve expanded margins in our business units. We did this while continuing to improve our service model to better reflect the needs of our clients. Our small business clients continue to enjoy ADP's around-the-clock support. Since many small business owners do not have the time during regular business hours to address their human capital needs, our move to 24/7 service for small businesses allows them to focus on HR at their convenience. In other business units, we've extended our service hours during the busiest times of the year, which has been well received by our clients. Overall, we want to make sure that when our clients are hard at work, ADP is hard at work with them. And finally, we sharpened ADP's focus on human capital management through the decision to spin-off our Dealer Services business into an independent publicly traded company. Overall, as ADP invests in innovations of tomorrow, our clients are enjoying our leading solutions today. So now let's move on to the fourth quarter and fiscal year results. ADP reported solid results for the fiscal year. Total revenues grew 8%. Worldwide new business bookings growth in Employer Services and PEO were 5% for the quarter and 7% for the year. These results were just below our expectations. However, as we mentioned in last quarter's call, the fourth quarter was in an especially difficult grow-over compared to the prior year. Nonetheless, we are very pleased to have sold over $1.4 billion in new annualized recurring revenues, which will contribute to our revenue growth over the coming months. New business bookings growth for the fourth quarter was mixed by market segment. In the small and mid-markets, we were very pleased with the double-digit growth ADP experienced and the PEO results continued to be strong. However, we were disappointed with the results in the high end of the upmarket where we sold fewer deals to companies with more than 10,000 employees compared with a year ago. In the low end of our national accounts market, meaning companies with 1,000 to 10,000 employees where ADP has historically been successful, new business bookings of both our Workforce Now and Vantage solutions were good. And we are pleased to have added 100 new Vantage clients during fiscal 2014. This is almost twice the number we sold last year. In our International business, we continue to see softness in new bookings growth in our in-country solutions in Europe due to continued economic recovery on the continent. However, we are pleased with the growth of our multinational solutions for companies based outside of the U.S. In Latin America, our new bookings growth was strong. As a result of the mixed results in the upmarket, our forecast for fiscal 2015 is for about 8% growth. Our long-term goal of 8% to 10% annual new bookings growth remains intact. Moving on to retention. Full year Employer Services worldwide client revenue retention increased this year to 91.4%. For those of you who have followed us for some time, you are aware that this level is an all-time high. I'm particularly pleased with these results as I believe they demonstrate the success of our new cloud-based platforms and are evidence that our migration strategy and focus on innovation are resonating in the marketplace. The success of the PEO continued with strong revenue growth reaching 15% for the year, primarily from growth in average worksite employees paid, which was a very strong 15% for the year. Dealer Services posted solid revenue growth in fiscal 2014 primarily through additions to its client space -- client base, resulting from positive competitive win rates and higher digital advertising revenues. The global automotive market continues to be strong with U.S. vehicle sales reaching prerecessionary levels. Our planned spin-off of the Dealer Services business is progressing well and we are still anticipating completion of the spin-off by October. There will be a pre-spin roadshow with the Dealer Services management team in the weeks leading off to the final spin-off. We are getting close to a decision on the name of the new company, as well as the branding and we'll be ready to share that information with you in mid-August. We remain excited about the planned spin-off of Dealer Services and the focus it will allow both management teams as we complete the separation of these 2 businesses. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jan to give you more details on the spin and walk you through our fiscal 2014 results. Jan Siegmund : Thank you, Carlos. As Carlos stated, we are progressing well with the planned spin-off of Dealer Services. An updated Form 10 was filed with the SEC on July 25 and can be found on the ADP Investor Relations website. We expect to file an updated Form 10 with fiscal 2014 results for the new company in early September. In conjunction with the spin-off, we are still expecting that ADP will receive at least $700 million from the new Dealer Services entity, which we intend to use to repurchase ADP stocks. With that, let's move on to our fiscal year 2014 results. Our fiscal year 2014 results include about $15 million of spin-related costs, and as indicated last quarter, these costs were excluded from our forecast for the year. We expect to incur an additional $40 million to $50 million of spin-related costs over the first 2 quarters of fiscal year 2015, which are also excluded from the fiscal year 2015 forecast as these costs will be reported within discontinued operations upon completion of the spin-off. And just to note, my comments exclude the impact of the $15 million of spin-related costs recorded in this year's fourth quarter, and the year-over-year comparison I am discussing are to the fiscal year 2013 financials adjusted to exclude the impairment charge of last year's fourth quarter. Before I get into the results, I want to call your attention to our cash and marketable securities balance of $4.1 billion at June 30, 2014. This includes 2,000 -- $2.2 billion of assets related to outstanding commercial paper in support of our extended investment strategy for the client funds portfolio and is footnoted on our condensed balance sheet. This borrowing was repaid on July 1. I also want to point out that ADP continued its shareholder-friendly actions, repurchasing 9 million shares for $679 million and paid cash dividends of over $880 million during fiscal year 2014. So now for the results. ADP's revenues grew 8%, nearly all organic, to $12.2 billion for the year. We achieved 8% growth in both pretax and net earnings and 9% earnings per share growth on fewer shares outstanding compared with the year ago. Overall, our results were solid, with each of our business segments performing well. Employer Services grew total revenues 8%, nearly all organic; the PEO grew 15%; and Dealer Services grew 7%. In Employer Services, growth in the small and mid-market contributed particularly well. And as Carlos mentioned earlier, Employer Services worldwide client retention improved to 91.4% on top of an already historically high retention rate. We are pleased to see continued strength in our same-store pays per control in Employer Services in the U.S. with an increase of 2.8% per year. In Europe, same-store pays per control declined by 0.5% for the full year and 0.3% for the fourth quarter. So while the economy across Europe remains a bit soft, it does appear to be stabilizing. Average client fund balances increased a healthy 8% for the fiscal year. Lower state unemployment tax rates were offset by : increases from our new business growth, especially in the small and midsized markets; wage growth, including bonus payments by our clients; as well as pays per control. The PEO delivered higher than anticipated results for the year with 15% revenue growth, driven by 15% average worksite employee growth and strong revenue retention. Dealer Services revenue growth of 7% was driven by new clients and applications installed, as well as increased digital advertising revenues, but was lower than our expectations because of continued weakness across Continental Europe and some softness in one of our transaction-based businesses. Dealer Services margin expansion of 130 basis points for the full year benefited from certain nonrecurring items in both the third and fourth quarter. As anticipated, ADP's pretax -- total pretax earnings were negatively impacted in fiscal year 2014 by the decline in client interest revenues resulting from low interest rates. The impact of low interest rates reduced ADP's revenue growth by almost 0.5 percentage point and pretax earnings growth by 3 percentage points as the lower yield more than offset the benefit received from the 8% growth in balances. Pretax margin was negatively impacted 80 basis points, and diluted earnings per share were lower by almost $0.08 or 3 percentage points for the year. Excluding the impact of the client funds investment strategy and recognizing the healthy margin expansion our business segments achieved for the fiscal year, largely driven by operating efficiencies, it is evident that there is leverage in ADP's business model and you will see this as we move on to our discussion of next year's outlook. So let me take you through our fiscal year 2015 forecast, starting with total company guidance. Remember that the forecast includes the Dealer Services business, but excludes any spin-related costs. We anticipate total revenue growth of 7% to 8%. Pretax margin for total ADP is anticipated to improve by 75 to 100 basis points from 18.8% last year, which excluded spin-related costs of approximately $15 million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014. We expect a higher effective tax rate of 34.6% compared with the 33.7% in fiscal year 2014. Diluted earnings per share are expected to grow 11% to 13% compared with $3.14 in fiscal year 2014, which excludes spin-related costs recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014. As it is part of our usual practice, the forecast does not contemplate further share buybacks beyond anticipated dilution related to employee equity comp plans, though it is clearly our intent to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders depending obviously on market conditions. In addition, this forecast does not contemplate any share repurchases from the $700 million or more ADP will receive from the new Dealer Services business at the time of the spin. Consistent with the tax-free nature of the spin, we are required to repurchase ADP shares with this cash within 12 months of the spin. However, our intent is to do so over the 9 months remaining in fiscal year 2015 after the completion of the spin, which would result in slight earnings per share accretion for the full year. We believe the ranges we have given you for revenue and earnings per share growth have contemplated both the opportunities and the challenges ADP is facing in fiscal year 2015. Typical items that could be impactful to earnings would include the success of our sales force in bringing new products to market and our ability to implement those products, possible changes to the regulatory environment, particularly any changes relative to the ACA, as well as our ability to sustain our client retention level. Consider, for example, at the high end of our revenue and earnings forecast ranges, we have anticipated the renewal of certain high-margin WOTC tax credit revenues in the second half of the fiscal year. Additionally, the interest rate environment will impact our new purchase rates, and foreign exchange rates could move either up or down. And while we don't provide quarterly guidance, I want you to be aware of certain items impacting the first 2 quarters for the fiscal year. As you may recall, we stepped up our investment in R&D during the second half of fiscal year 2014. Investments we have made include such innovations as data analytics user experience, enhancement to our strategic platforms and improvements in our time-to-market capabilities. I also would like to remind you that new bookings growth in the last -- in last year's first quarter was 1%, and as a result, we anticipate higher selling expenses in the first quarter compared with the year ago. We expect that the year-over-year pressure from these items will result in additional expense of about $30 million in each of the first 2 quarters of fiscal year 2015. Therefore, you should assume that ADP margin improvement and profitability is weighted more towards the second half of the fiscal year. And now before I take you through the details of our forecast for the client fund investment strategy, there are a few things I would like to point out. First, the objective of our investment strategy remains safety, liquidity and diversification. At June 30, about 82% of our fixed income portfolio was invested in AAA and AA-rated securities. We continue to base the interest assumptions in our forecast on the fed funds future contracts and forward year curve for the 3.5- and 5-year U.S. government agencies, as we do not believe it is possible to accurately predict future interest rates, the shape of the yield curve or new bond issuance behavior of corporations and other issuers. I'll also remind you that our strategy usually results in about 15% to 20% of the reinvestments -- of the investments maturing each year and therefore subject to investment risk each year. We anticipate that the maturities of fiscal year 2015 will be in line with this range. We anticipate average client fund balances for fiscal year 2015 in the range of $21.8 billion to $22.2 billion, which represents 5% to 7% growth. About 1 percentage point of this growth is expected to come from outside of the U.S., evidence that our global money movement operation is gaining traction. We anticipate a yield on the client funds portfolio of 1.7% to 1.8%, which represents a decrease of up to 10 basis points from the fiscal year 2014. We anticipate that client fund interest, as well as the total impact of pretax earnings from the extended investment strategy will be up to $5 million to $15 million compared with fiscal 2014. And although we are forecasting a positive impact to pretax earnings from the client fund investment strategy, we are still expecting a slight drag of 10 to 15 basis points on ADP's pretax margin due to the highly profitable nature of these revenues, which are forecasted to grow at a slower rate than overall revenues. If this fiscal year 2014 forecast for the client funds investment strategy is realized, it will be the first time since 2008 that ADP will experience a positive impact to both revenues and earnings. However, the benefit is not expected to occur until the second half of fiscal year. Now the guidance for our business segments. For Employer Services, we are forecasting revenue growth of about 6% to 7% with pretax margin expansion of about 100 basis points. We anticipate an increase in our pays per control metric in the U.S. of 2% to 3%. For PEO Services, we are forecasting 13% to 15% revenue growth with up to 50 basis points in pretax margin expansion. We are forecasting about 8% growth in the annual dollar value of ES and PEO worldwide new business bookings from the over $1.4 billion sold in fiscal year 2014. And for Dealer Services, we are forecasting 7% to 8% revenue growth with about 50 basis points of pretax margin expansion. And now I will return the call back over to Carlos for his closing remarks. Carlos A. Rodriguez: Thank you, Jan. As I discussed earlier in the call, with the announcement of the spin-off of Dealer Services, we have sharpened our focus on HCM. As such, we have slightly modified our strategic growth pillars to demonstrate this refined focus. In fiscal 2015, we expect to grow our business by focusing on these 3 pillars. First, we intend to grow our integrated suite of cloud-based HCM, benefits and payroll solutions to serve the U.S. market through further penetration of our strategic platforms : RUN, Workforce Now and Vantage, as well as new HCM offerings. Further offerings, including products related to compliance with the Affordable Care Act and other innovative solutions are expected to be released in fiscal 2015. We look forward to continuing our migration efforts in the mid- and upmarkets. Our second pillar is to invest to grow and scale our HR business process outsourcing, or BPO solutions, by leveraging our platforms and processes. The PEO and our BPO offerings in the small and the mid-market are performing well. And finally, our third pillar is to leverage our global presence to offer clients HCM, benefits and payroll solutions where they do business. As I mentioned earlier in the call, ADP solutions are now offered in countries that are home to virtually all employees who work for multinational corporations. We believe our multinational solutions bring global power to the marketplace and will be part of our future success. All 3 of our strategic pillars are based on ADP's history of stellar client service, ability to navigate regulatory compliance, rich data set and passion for providing innovative solutions to the market. Our accomplishments in fiscal 2014 reflect the commitment we've made to maintain our position as the leading global provider of human capital management as we step into fiscal 2015 and beyond. I believe ADP is focused on the right things to grow the business and enhance long-term shareholder value. We remain committed to shareholder-friendly actions and return over $1.5 billion in excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks during fiscal year 2015. And before we take your questions, I wanted to let you know that Elena has decided to join the new Dealer Services company that will be formed at the conclusion of the spin-off. Elena has provided more than a decade of strong leadership and insight as the Head of Investor Relations at ADP. I wanted to publicly thank Elena for her years of service and wish her nothing but the best as she joins the new company. Starting today, please direct your questions and requests to Sara Grillot. Many of you already know her and have worked with her. And now, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Togut of Evercore. David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Congratulations, Elena, on your new role. Elena Charles : Thank you. David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Carlos, could you just walk us through your thought process on FY '15 ES bookings growth and maybe dig in a little more on FY '14. You seem to be scaling back expectations throughout the year. I know you highlighted weakness in the National Accounts market, but do you think some of this was execution-oriented with the ADP sales force? Increased competition? What are your thoughts? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Well, I think we -- from the beginning of the year in the first quarter, I think we shared with you that we had some what we consider to be some execution issues, not across the entire ADP sales force, but really concentrated in our upmarket sales force and I think that unfortunately continued throughout the year. It's not unusual for us when we have the kind of, I would say, very slow start to then continue to struggle throughout the rest of the year. It's just -- it's been something that historically has been hard to overcome just because of the way the incentives work and momentum and so forth. But just want to reiterate that, I think, it was clear in our comments that the rest of our ADP sales force and the rest of our markets performed incredibly well, even including the low end of National Accounts. So it was a fairly concentrated issue in some respects because of some grow-over issues with some large accounts we sold in the previous year. But there's really no escaping the fact that we had some execution issues in our upmarket and it is an important part of our overall results. Although it's not -- as you can see from the results, despite that weakness, we still managed to achieve what I would say are pretty respectable sales results, especially when you look at them in the context of compounded annual growth rate over the last 2 or 3 years. So it's an important part of our sales results, but -- so is the low end of the market and so is the mid-market and so is PEO and insurance services and a lot of the other products that we sell. But I think in view of some of those execution challenges we had, I think Jan and I think took the position that we just thought it was prudent to be careful in terms of our planning process for fiscal year '15 in terms of what our expectation is from our new bookings growth. But we hope and we -- that's why we reiterated our commitment to the 8% to 10% long-term growth in sales because that's really what we planned for in terms of our headcount and productivity improvement expectations. But I think, we're -- you could call and you could say that we're hedging, but we're just being -- we're being careful because of some of these challenges we have just in case they're related to anything other than specific execution issues, which is, right now, still our hypothesis. David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Understood. Just as a quick follow-up. What are your headcount growth targets for the ES sales force in fiscal 2015? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Our headcount growth is expected to be around 3% to 4% next year. And again, you can obviously then back in to the fact that we expect about half of our sales growth to come from headcount growth and half to come from productivity improvements. That's a little slightly faster headcount growth, but not by much, than what we've been experiencing over the last 2 to 3 years where we've actually had more productivity growth and headcount growth into our sales results, which we'd been extremely happy with. But again, in view of our -- of some of our execution challenges this year, we thought it was prudent to invest a little bit more in sales and accelerate our headcount just slightly more to make sure we take out a little bit of an insurance policy in terms of delivering the results. Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee of RBC Capital Markets. Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : The 6% to 7% growth in Employer guidance for next year is, I think, a touch lower than what you've been doing over the last years. Is that just no M&A in the numbers and maybe in light of this slightly lower sales number? Or is there anything else going on there? Carlos A. Rodriguez: I think some of it is -- there are some timing issues in terms of calendar that, again, we typically don't get into them but when you start getting into tenths of a percentage point, these things do unfortunately add up. So our growth in net new business is still contributing to our growth rate, but it will contribute about 0.4% less in terms of revenue growth rate in Employer Services, assuming that we hit our retention rate and our sales plan as we've given you in terms of the guidance. So that's some of it, but that's really not a big number. We have a couple of other items around calendar and assumptions around our balance looking slightly lower, which affects the way Employer Services reports its revenues because of the way we credit them at 4.5% fixed interest rate. So there are 2 or 3 items that add up to it, but it's really nothing -- there's no specific one item that I could point to that is creating some sort of big issue for us. We're still pretty positive about the acceleration on our Employer Services revenue growth over the last 2 or 3 years. I think we're at a level now where we're pretty comfortable with that growth. We'd love to accelerate it even more, but any major change in that growth rate would come really as a result of acquisitions or a major improvement in retention or a major, I guess, beat on the sales results as well. Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : And then a follow-up. I don't know if it's possible, can you break out or give us a sense of the difference in the revenue retention rate between those on the new cloud -- newer cloud offerings versus legacy offerings? And if it is, in fact, a decent amount higher, what's the gating factor to more aggressively pushing through the migrations in the mid-market? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Let me just to go through a couple of numbers in terms of whether we're being aggressive or not. We have less than 50,000 clients left in our Small Business segment on EasyPay, which is our legacy platform and I think we're down to under 5,000 of the PCPW clients left on -- which is our legacy platform in our Major Accounts space. So this is a pretty, in my opinion, a lot of progress and very, very proud of the organization because 2 or 3 years ago we were on a different path here. And we're going to really be -- we're going to be off of these 2 platforms here in -- within fiscal year '15 and with -- off the EasyPay platform relatively quickly here, given at the pace that they're moving at. So I think we've been aggressive and we're going to continue to be aggressive because we have to move on to other platforms and other parts of the business where we have some legacy platforms. I think Jan might have some specifics on the retention rates. I can tell you anecdotally that the last several quarters, as we looked at the retention rates of clients who have moved from PCPW over -- which is our legacy platform in Major Accounts over to our Workforce Now platform, the retention rates have been higher than the line average. So we think it's helping us in terms of our retention rate, but there's lots of other moving parts in the retention rate other than migrations. So you have to be careful about building any kind of model in terms of any improvements. Likewise, we can't specifically attribute retention rates in Small Business to the migration of clients onto RUN, but that retention rate happens to have also been quite good over the last 2 or 3 years as we've been moving clients. But there are other moving parts at work. And then lastly, I would caution that, as we get to the last mile of some of these platforms and some of these migrations, we have to be prepared to potentially have some challenges with the last few clients in terms of retention and migrations. We're not planning for that and we're hoping against all hope that, that doesn't occur, but I think it's prudent to assume that the last thousand clients are going to be harder than the first thousand clients. We had a lot clients that have been raising their hands to migrate and the last year few of them are probably going to be ones where we're going to have to ask them nicely and provide them incentives to move over. So I think it's a balanced picture in terms of retention. And we also are moving on now to other platforms that are included in our retention rates overall, so it's not just RUN and Workforce Now and PCPW and EasyPay that impact our retention. We have a lot of benefits platforms that we're trying to consolidate and migrate off of and we still have a couple of other smaller payroll platforms that are legacy also we're on the process of moving off of. So we have still quite a bit of work to do, but the progress has been phenomenal. I'm incredibly proud of the organization. I think, overall, it's had a positive financial impact on us so far. Operator : Our next question comes from Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Just following up on the last discussion. Could you talk a bit more about the magnitude of potential cost savings from shutting down legacy platforms? I know that some of that may be going back into investment plans, but I was hoping to get a sense of the growth savings that you might be able to get from here. Carlos A. Rodriguez: It really is a great question, which we're really trying hard to internally get our arms around exactly that issue. But for example, just in terms of real life example, the -- we're almost off of the EasyPay platform here and those migrations took a great deal of effort and we ramped up reasonable amount of expense and people in order to accomplish that. And so as we plan for fiscal year '15, our business units are working very effectively together in terms of seeing what we could do to help overall ADP rather than just focusing on any individual business unit. And in this example, we've decided to move some of the resources that we're working on the migrations of EasyPay to RUN and moving them over to our Major Account and National Account migration efforts because those folks are -- even though they were working on a different platform, they're dedicated resources that were also trained on migration efforts. So even though they have to learn new products and new platforms, rather than downsizing or eliminating those resources, our decision was to move those resources over. And in fact, overall, Jan may have the exact number, but we actually are increasing incrementally our investment in our spend on migrations in fiscal year '15 versus '14. So I think this call is really -- very difficult on this call to go through the level of detail. We're a, as you know, a $12 billion company with a fair amount of legacy and there's a very reasonable list of projects and targets that we have that we believe will really create a better financial picture for ADP long term and we see evidence of that already in what we've done with RUN and with PCPW and SBS and in Major Accounts, but I think as you said it -- you said it best that we are not done and we're continuing to invest. So I think for '15, it is not appropriate to plan any kind of savings or improvement as a result of migrations because we actually are planning for a slight incremental increase in spend on that, obviously with a view -- we're not doing it without the expectation that there will be some large benefit in the future, and I wish I could quantify that and give that to you today, but we're just not prepared to do that. Jan Siegmund : And I think what Carlos is saying is above and beyond of the margin expansion that is pretty healthy that you have seen in our business segments -- I mean you see the results of ES in this fourth quarter, which had really very, very nice margin expansion. We delivered our margin expansion fiscal year '14 above our kind of long-term expectation of 50 basis points and the confidence that, overall, the business is scaling to which migrations in an indirect way and in this complicated way help us is also reflecting in the 100 basis points guidance that we give for the improvement of pretax margin in the Employer Services segment, which is also above of what we have historically really committed to at this point in time. So as the CFO, I'm pleased with the progress we are making in the business overall, of which migrations are a small part and a part, but in driving the scale for us. So my hope is that, that is being recognized as progress we're making relative to scaling of our business, which we put a lot of effort in and it's showing the results now for a number of years in a row. Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Great. Just switching gears briefly. Given the improving labor market trends, I'm wondering if, when you put out the 2% to 3% guidance range for pays per control, if you see any bias towards the high end of that and if that is potentially a conservative approach. Jan Siegmund : Well, the range includes the full range, 2% to 3% and -- but you're right. Of course, our pays per control have been now very strong for a couple of years really, but at 2.8%, growing again faster than the U.S. economy is growing. Employment, which is a benefit that ADP has that our clients -- doing a little bit better on employment growth than the rest of the country. And it is just I think more prudent planning, and looking forward, the economy seems to be picking up and being on solid grounds. But since it is, A, above the national growth rate and we have this up for a number of years, we don't really have a strong formed opinion that it's going to be at the upper end or the middle of the range. But it moves slowly, you know that from observation, and we exited at 2.8%. So that, I think, is where I would form my mind around. Operator : Our next question comes from David Grossman of Stifel Financial. We'll move on to Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Wanted to switch gears to the PEO business. It's been fairly strong and your expectations are for that to continue. Can you just give us a little bit more color, what's driving that and how sustainable you think that is? Carlos A. Rodriguez: It's a great question because we've been asking the same question over the last 6 to 9 months. And I think, as usual, it's a combination of things and I don't know that we have a scientific answer about the percentage of each factor. It's impossible to deny that some of it is just good execution because that business has been executing well for several years. And I think we just -- our sense of just watching what they've done in terms of building their sales infrastructure, their go-to-market strategies, their product, et cetera, is that they are just doing well from an execution standpoint and from a leadership standpoint. So I think some of it is that. And I just want to remind everyone that, that business has had double-digit growth here for several years and our sales results have been really quite impressive for several years as well, not just this one last year. Having said that, as we've said in the call before, we believe that we have some help from the Affordable Care Act, which has caused, if nothing else, a lot of activity in all of the markets, but particularly in the small end of the market in terms of people looking at alternatives whether they be the exchanges or they be a PEO. There are some things about the structure of ACA around large groups that provide some potential benefits in some states, some of which we got in '14 in terms of health, some of which we might get in '15 and '16. But there are also some things in the ACA that beyond 2016 may make it actually difficult in terms of acting as -- or at least may level the playing field and remove any potential advantage that anyone, including us, may have had in '14, '15 and '16. And so I think it's a balanced picture there where I think ACA appears to be helping, but we're not planning on it helping forever and the combination of that with just great leadership, great execution and good value proposition and I think competitive offering from a price standpoint. And so I think it's a combination of a lot of factors, but as I think you just alluded to, we're incredibly pleased with that because it's helping, not just our overall growth rate, but growth in earnings. So that business, as you know, has a lot of pass-throughs in it, but what we care about is obviously dollars of profit, and in terms of our -- the growth in pretax operating income from that business, whether it's on a per employee, per client or any basis is really quite helpful to ADP's overall growth and profitability. Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: All right, that's helpful. And as a follow-up, you mentioned the additional expense in each of the first 2 quarters in the current fiscal year. Can you just tell us, which line items that will be affected? And also, does that mean you're not expecting pretax margin expansion in the first half of the year and it's all going to be back-end loaded? Jan Siegmund : I don't think we want to go as detailed as to the guidance the pretax margin by quarter. I think the attempt to isolate these 2 items was to help you a little bit with the skewing in your models. And they will be found, really, in the segment reporting line as they pertain mostly to the ES segment basically. Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Yes. I guess, I was alluding to the expense line item on the income statement. Is that all in SG&A? Jan Siegmund : It would be in systems development, as well as SG&A. Carlos A. Rodriguez: It's going to be in a couple of places because -- I think that's why we mentioned where the comparison year-over-year of our R&D and technology spending, which is on a couple different lines and then our sales expense, which most -- would be mostly in the SG&A line. So I think it is probably spread out in a couple of different places, but tilted towards the SG&A. Jan Siegmund : And back to your initial question, the first half is really going to be depressed on the pretax margin side. I think you got that right. And... Carlos A. Rodriguez: But depressed compared to the full year, not necessarily going backwards from the previous year. Because I think your question was around -- I don't remember exactly how you worded it, but you don't expect to go backwards necessarily. It's just that, in comparison to the overall pretax margin for the year, Q1 and Q2 will be lower, as -- just as we expect the growth rate of operating income to be slightly -- the growth rate to be slightly lower in the first half versus the full year. Jan Siegmund : Compared to overall guidance range. Operator : Our next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : This is Ashish Sabadra calling on behalf of Bryan Keane. My question was in regards to the interest on funds held for client. It's positive to see that number turn around and be positive in fiscal year '15. But as you think about the out-years and the funds coming up for reinvestment and the interest rate based on the forward curve, I was just wondering if you could provide some color on your expectations for the growth in that interest on funds held in -- going beyond fiscal year '15. If you could just provide some color on that. Carlos A. Rodriguez: Jan and I are fighting over who gets to answer the question. We've been waiting for 5 years to talk about this. So I will let Jan do the honors. Jan Siegmund : The -- so just to provide a little bit more color to '15, which we are guiding towards is you'll see our balance growth to be still healthy, which is driven by new -- good new additions to our client base, which is a good sign and then continued good pays per control growth, et cetera. But our rate of funds maturing during fiscal year '15 is still higher than our -- the rate is approximately 2.7% and the reinvestment rate is lower, so we do expect overall pressure on our yield for fiscal year '15. So you'll have as the turnaround situation, that it will be accretive to our earnings by the $5 million to $15 million of a client fund strategy impact, but it will be putting pressure on our margins because the growth of that client fund revenue is lower than our overall revenue base due to the situation that I just described to you. So it's in fact really just a turning point and you have to be very careful in thinking that through because it does -- it expands earnings, but it depresses margins and this is the mechanics beyond it. As we look forward, and this is now based on the forward yield curve that you could look also in material we published for you about the embedded rates in our client funds portfolio in the third quarter, this will get better throughout the next few years. We don't provide specific guidance, obviously, for fiscal year '16 and '17 and '18. We're happy to provide '15 guidance in this detail, but it will be naturally better. Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : No, that's great. Good to hear that. And just a quick follow-up on the Dealer Services spinoff. As we think about the model post the spinoff and think about the other expense line item and the margin expansion in fiscal year '15, I was just wondering if you could provide some color on how we should think about the model post the spinoff. Jan Siegmund : Yes. So we mentioned it in our comments. We just filed an updated Form 10 responding to questions that the SEC gave us and should have a look for that. We are not prepared to provide additional financial updates at this point in time. You'll see the updated fiscal numbers for '14 included in the September numbers. And then Dealer Services will provide their go-forward financials. But we reconfirm that we're expecting $40 million to $50 million of incremental public company cost for the company, and that's pretty much, I think, the model that you should build up to the level of position that we see today. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim MacDonald of First Analysis. James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division : I think you mentioned that the ACA benefits in the PEO may diminish over time. Maybe you could explain that a little more. Carlos A. Rodriguez: I can attempt it, but again, this call may not be the appropriate place to get into all the details. But we're happy to -- because this is all public information, and we're happy kind of off-line to take anyone through kind of our view of the world, which is an uncertain view of the world because it's been constantly changing. As you probably also know, things have been delayed multiple times, and there's been multiple changes in the laws and the regulations, so we will keep every quarter on top of that and updating you. But in general, in 2017, there are some changes that take place, that are scheduled to take place, that I think would potentially diminish any -- if there is an advantage or a positive wind at the back of our PEO or any other PEO, we believe that, that might diminish in 2017 as a result of the opening up of all the exchanges and all the regulations to now large groups as well as small groups. So I think getting into more detail would probably not be easy to do here, but we're happy to have that conversation off-line with anybody because it's not obviously related to our specific guidance, just related to how the law and the regulations operate. But again, just the footnote on that is that 2 or 3 -- what we thought was going to happen 2 or 3 years ago has changed multiple times as a result of adjustments that have been made to the laws and the regulations. So it's something that, unfortunately, we have to continue to monitor. But overall, it's definitely a positive right now for us. Jan Siegmund : And maybe I'll add to just remind, the PEO has of course executed and grown for a decade in a long, long time for us. And as Carlos alluded in his initial comments, the principal driver or a principal driver of advantage that ADP has, aside from a competitive offering, is our strong distribution capability that leverages the scale and scope of our overall down and mid-market operations to feed leads into the business. And that strong new business bookings growth that we have seen this year was definitely aided by an excellent execution in that space, and that is something that is due to ADP's inherent structural advantages. And that would not diminish, hopefully, in the long run. Carlos A. Rodriguez: Yes. And I think to be -- again, I think that's a fair point. I'm glad Jan brought it up today. The PEO has, from the time that ADP entered the business, has grown -- from the time it made a major acquisition in the business in 1999, has grown from 65,000 worksite employees to 300,000 worksite employees before any Affordable Care Act impact. So we're not planning to go backwards or to change the growth trajectory of that business as a result of ACA. We're just acknowledging that it may be giving us some incremental help today and that incremental help may not be large in the future, but we would not be planning for anything other than what we've been able to do for -- because it's just the inherent advantages that, that business has in terms of its value proposition and distribution as being part of ADP. So we will continue to leverage those advantages beyond any kind of regulatory changes that may take place in the next several years. James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division : And related to that, your guidance for next year of 13% to 15% is below the 19% this quarter. It seems like you're sort of built in for growth above that rate, at least early in the year. Is that right? And what would cause the lower growth rate maybe later in the year? Carlos A. Rodriguez: That's a great question, because we did look at it, again, over the last couple of days as we were getting ready to make this call. And all I can tell you is we had, again, a small item that helped -- that was a onetime item in the quarter, and we kind of relooked at our expectations or our plans for sales in that business and our loss assumptions in that business. And we felt comfortable that, that was the appropriate range to provide you guys. Because, again, the business tends to, like all of our businesses, we do have sometimes small calendar issues and other onetime issues that affect us, but we try to be transparent and give you guys a fair range of what we really expect. And I think we're being fair based on what we -- because I -- you could probably look at the previous quarters and see that the 19% is somewhat -- it's great news, and we appreciate it and we'll take it. But it's not -- on a trend line, it would be out of trend on the upper end. And so I think we expect to get back on trend, which is a slightly lower number than the 19%. Operator : Our next question comes from David Grossman of Stifel Financial. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : I dropped off for a few minutes, so I just -- if this was covered, just -- we can pass. But Carlos, you talked about the sales execution, obviously, at the high end, and I think I understand that. I'm just curious whether or not, since this is a new product for this segment of the market, do you have any feedback on the technical merits of the product? And for those that have purchased it, what their experience has been and how it stacked up? Carlos A. Rodriguez: So to clarify, we're talking about the upmarket, especially the higher end of the upmarket. We also -- I'm assume you're referring to Vantage, but I just want to clarify that global -- some of the GlobalView sales would be in that same category, and any increases or decreases in sales of GlobalView would also impact our comments and our guidance around growth in the upper end. We also have some sales that take place in our benefits platforms that are also very high end, and those comparisons also would be in those numbers. So having said that, I just wanted to clarify that we have -- we're broader than just our Vantage platform in the upper end of the market. Having said that, the answer is, no, we're not aware of any issues that would prevent us from winning. So again, that's why we keep harping on the execution issues. We're clearly still -- you heard the comments about our focus on innovation and our time-to-market and how fast we're trying to move, so to be clear, we're not standing still, and so we are making a lot of enhancements as we speak not only to Vantage but also to our other strategic platform in national accounts, which is our enterprise platform. And so I think that we are doing whatever we can to improve our user experience to make sure that we have the right kind of functionality, to make sure that our -- the products are -- provide global solutions as well, not just GlobalView, but Vantage itself has also been enhanced with some global capabilities. So we're doing a lot of things to enhance our competitiveness in the upper end of the upmarket, but we're not aware of any glaring holes or problems from a competitive standpoint. Jan Siegmund : And David, in order to give you a little bit more color around the momentum of Vantage is, as Carlos mentioned, we doubled the number of sales this year that got to new clients throughout the fiscal year, so that is in line with our expectations and our plans. So the interesting part is the comments have to be really dissected by the part of national accounts that's selling in the 1 to 10,000 and above 10,000 so it's not a general upmarket comment that color for you [ph]. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. I'm wondering, Jan, maybe if I could just ask a financial question. Could you perhaps give us some more color on free cash flow in fiscal '15 and perhaps help us understand whether the Dealer business contributes pretty much prorated a [ph] free cash flow? Jan Siegmund : In general, yes. Let me jump back to free cash -- or to cash flow in -- to '14 that provides you the starting point for '15. You saw our cash flow from operations to be above [ph] $1.8 billion and that was up 16% year-over-year. And I want to caution that, that is impacted by items that are onetime or timing items so when you adjust for our changes in working capital and some lower pension contributions we made and the increase for stock comp, our actual kind of like-to-like cash flow has been closer to about $1.6 billion or 7% growth, I would say, in a like-to-like comparison. And historically, our cash flow from operations has really grown in line with our operating results. And that's a good assumption to have, and there's no difference between the business in principle. Obviously, the cash flows that ADP will receive from the dividend are excluded from this. But from the operational perspective, I can answer your question, that is really kind of in line with what the business is doing. We published our capital expenditures for Dealer Services on Form 10 that you can find. So there's really nothing unusual in the cash flow situation for Dealer Services. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : So the free cash flow conversion of Dealer is very similar to ADP? Jan Siegmund : Very similar, very similar, very similar. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : This is Ramsey for Jason. On your -- back to your new business bookings, you're guiding for a slight acceleration in the metric for fiscal '15. And as you mentioned, your easiest comp is by far in the first quarter, which has historically been a relatively inconsistent quarter. Can you give us some additional color on your confidence level, your expectations or just dynamics you see for the metric specific to the first quarter? I mean, should we assume, because of the easy comp, that the Q1 result should be quite high? Or anything additional there would be helpful. Carlos A. Rodriguez: I wish I could, but getting the look from Elena that -- and really, all kidding aside, we -- as you know, we're only in the first month of the quarter so it's very -- sales, unlike revenues, for us, like, we have a lot of visibility around a lot of things in our business because it's a great business model because of its recurring revenue nature. The sales are something that we really can't -- like we have -- we know what our headcount growth is, which drives on a -- if you look at it over multiple quarters and multiple years, it's very easy to answer the question. If you look at any individual month or any individual quarter, we have to be careful because it's just -- it is a -- like other companies in terms of their -- what they consider to be revenues, which is sales. For us, sales is like other companies' revenues where it's very, very -- it's harder, not very hard, but it's harder to really pin that number down. So I think we've avoided giving quarterly guidance in the past and we certainly don't want to start now. So unfortunately, I'm going to have to defer, but we believe we have a headcount in place. We believe we have a easier grow-over so there are some factors that give us comfort about the first quarter. But I just don't have the ability to give you -- and I honestly don't have the visibility today to be able to comment on it. Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : All right, that's fair. On another track entirely, you mentioned you're seeing some stabilization in Europe. It's obviously been a headwind in the last couple of quarters. Are you seeing what you'd describe as sort of an infection point there? How should we think about Europe in the context of contribution to your fiscal '15 projections, guidance? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Well, I think the -- for example, from a pays per control standpoint, I think the stabilization that Jan was referring to is really purely on the employment levels in Europe, which, generally speaking, whether it's in the U.S. or Europe or anywhere else, are indicators of other things also stabilizing. But the only comment we're making is that the pays per control has gone from 0.8, 0.9 negative to now 0.2 or 0.3. So the trend is heading towards flat, but not obviously growing yet. So that's better than where we have been and it's indication of some stability. On the sales front, we had a slight decrease in our sales results in Europe, which, in a context of the situation, we were very pleased with, and we expect that to grow. That's our plan, is to have our European sales results grow in fiscal year '15. So that's part of our assumption that there is stabilization, that there is some improvement and there will be some end demand generated in Europe. So all of those things added together with very good retention rates because I should add also that they had an improvement in retention in fiscal year '14 versus '13, which was great, and we certainly appreciate. So when you add that all together, we expect to have positive revenue growth. And I think in the context of the situation, we're happy with that, but it's not helping accelerate ADP's revenue growth. And it was the European results, not the international results, but the European results were, net-net, had a lower growth rate in '14 than the line average of ADP. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Foresi of Janney Capital Markets. Jeffrey Rossetti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : This is Jeff Rossetti on for Joe Foresi. Just a quick question. I think, Carlos, you alluded to the transition of some of the remainder of your clients that haven't switched to cloud maybe taking a little bit longer. Is there any kind of incentive, any kind of discount that you might provide them and how that might impact your assumptions with respect to margins? Carlos A. Rodriguez: I think the incentives are so far, again, and one might argue that we have gone after the largest segment first to where they was probably the biggest opportunity, and they were -- and it's probably there where there was the most natural demand for movement. So there, the tool was largely around better products and enhancements and integration. And so there really wasn't year-to-date -- not year-to-date, but up until now in terms of our migration strategy, it hasn't been around giveaways or lower price or incentives, it's been around you are on this legacy payroll platform. And I think of you move to an HCM cloud platform, you now have time and attendance benefits, it helps with compliance of ACA, easier user experience. You have access to mobile applications. So it's been largely a pull strategy, if you will, of getting people excited about a product that we believe is better for them and helps them manage their employees better and more effectively, more cost effectively. So we haven't yet found ourselves in a position where we had to do unnatural acts to move clients. That doesn't mean we haven't spent money because we've invested a lot in the migration tool, and generally speaking, we haven't \"charged\" for it, so we've incurred the expense of some of those migrations and some of those movements. So as we go forward, we'll keep you apprised of whether or not we end up needing to use incentives, discounts, pricing, et cetera. We are considering using our sales force more than we have thus far. The sales force has been involved only to the extent that there's an opportunity to add additional modules and increase the penetration rate of our clients at the individual client level. As we move more upmarket in our migration strategy, we are likely to involve our sales force, which would obviously result in the incurrence of some commission expense, and we would certainly keep you updated as to whether or not pricing is affected. But so far, nothing to report. Jeffrey Rossetti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : Okay, very helpful. And just as a follow-up, could you provide any time line with respect to some of the compliance-related products that you'll be rolling out this year related to ACA? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Jan probably has the answer to that one. Jan Siegmund : Yes, I think we have current plans to introduce the ACA compliance product in its comprehensive view at the -- in the second quarter of this fiscal year and then we hope to see it contributing to sales for the second half of the fiscal year. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Marcon of Robert W. Baird. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : A couple of specific elements with regards to products, particularly as it relates to the higher end in terms of Vantage and Workforce. Can you talk a little bit about the -- some of the new upgrades that are going to be coming out? I was at SHRM, saw the previews and looked pretty interesting. Just wondering when those would be rolled out and if your guidance is assuming any sort of specific impact from those. Carlos A. Rodriguez: I think in terms of the impact on the guidance, I think we have convinced ourselves over the last 2 or 3 years that for us to drive our sales growth, it can't just be elbow grease. It has to be product-driven. We also have to execute, but they have to have product to help, right? The market wants it. The market wants integration. It wants global. It wants a good user experience. So those are all the things that we are focused on. I think some of the things you may have seen are specific items around data analytics that are going to, I think, really help our clients manage their workforces better, both from a planning standpoint but also from a compensation standpoint. We've added some great tools in the talent management space that, from an onboarding and recruitment standpoint, we think are very positive. So we're adding a lot of enhancements to Global -- we think we've talked over the last couple of quarters that we've added Global system of record. In our Vantage platform, we have added a capability to provide streamline as an offering with Workforce Now in major accounts, which is -- there are many clients in our national -- in our major account space, and those are 50 to 1,000 that have employees in other countries, and so that's a fairly significant enhancement as well. So I think we have a lot of things and it's reflected in our spend rate on innovation and product development and R&D, and I think you've seen a few of them. And how much each one specifically is quantified in terms of its -- in terms of our forecast in sales, the ACA is really the only one where we have kind of specific dollars assigned because it was -- not because we have a scientific way of doing it, it's because it was easier as a separate swim lane, if you will, to look at. But all of the things I just mentioned and all of the things you've seen are part of the plan to continue to drive our win rates in the market and to help us hopefully grow our market share and grow slightly faster than the rest of the market, which is what we're trying to do through our sales results. Jan Siegmund : And Mark, the features that Carlos described are either available today or will become available in fall of what were presented at the SHRM. So -- and naturally, it will enhance overall sales dynamic, driving hopefully Workforce Now and Vantage sales. Carlos A. Rodriguez: And I think from a packaging standpoint, which I think is important because I think the world has moved in a direction where consumerism is a big factor in all technology solutions, so we are really putting a new skin, if you will, on most of our products. And some of them what we talked about in terms of our innovation going on in our New York innovation lab is a combination of a lot of things, some of which we're not prepared to talk about yet. But our new user experience and our new packaging, I think, is something that is coming out very, very soon here and I think will again, I think, help us from a competitive standpoint and just, I think, really help the sales force in terms of its ability to get in the door and close business. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : So you mentioned in the fall, do you think it will be ready for the key fall selling season? Or would it be more of a -- this is, we're rolling this out and GA will be -- and I'm referring specifically the analytics and the user interface is what I was specifically relating -- referring to as well as the social aspects. Jan Siegmund : So the analytics product is in the market, actually. I have a statistic here that we sold already the first client, so I think in the fourth quarter, we have -- we sold a number of clients actually and there's a great dynamic already, for [ph] dynamics in the marketplace, so it's available and being sold. And the user experience coming out in fall is already part of our demonstration. I think you saw in the third quarter Carlos presented, I think, a snapshot in the slides about it. So I think I want to take it, from financial point, I think that what you're angling for. Our new product introductions putting risk or opportunity into our new growth number and my assessment would be that it is, as in past years, contemplated in our overall guidance. They don't form a huge amount of planned sales dollars, but they're clearly a part of making our product more competitive. So I don't think there's more or less that's [ph] relative to these product introductions in our sales numbers than in previous years. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : And then just a follow-up question, just with regards to new sales. What percentage of the very upper end of the client base would typically account for -- what percentage of new sales would that very upper end 10,000-plus typically end up accounting for? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Very small in terms of the overall percentage, which I can say for almost any other category of ADP, we're so big and so diversified that there isn't any one thing. But the difference is that it is very lumpy and we've -- this has been going on for decades, right, and we've got a few quarters where we've had to tell you about some of this lumpiness that happened in the upper end of the market. So when you're comparing just the upper end of the market to the upper end of the market, you can have swings and variability. But in terms of its impact on overall ADP, as you can see, it can affect our overall sales growth by around 1%. But 1% sales growth is about a, I think it's a $15 million impact on revenue for ADP in fiscal year '15. So these are just not giant impacts or giant numbers, but they affect the numbers, and that's why we're trying to be transparent, help you guys with it. But it isn't what's going to make or break our results or ADP. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Siva Krishna Prasad Borra - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : This is S.K. Prasad Borra for Jim Schneider. Couple of questions, if I may. Firstly, on your cost base, how do you expect the cost base to roll [ph], especially your investments around cloud solutions. How much of that would be dedicated to R&D and how much would go to sales and marketing? And secondly, on the margin profile, what you get for cloud solutions, if you compare that with your legacy products, is there a huge gap? Or do you think it will be comparable in the medium term? Carlos A. Rodriguez: I'll take the second part first and then maybe Jan can help with the first. But I think on the second part, just as a reminder, so we are not a pure software technology company. So the spend that we have on the services component and the compliance component of our products, we hope, becomes more efficient and more productive over time in part because of help from going to cloud-based products. But there isn't an -- there is not an enormous change that we have planned there yet. We have seen some improvements in terms of what we need to spend on service in our low end of the business and in mid-market as a result of new cloud-based solutions, and our implementation processes, in some cases, are easier and faster. So I think there's some benefit there. But we have, unlike, again, a pure play technology software, it's not quite -- if I'm -- because I think, if I understand the nature of your question, it's not quite as scientific as you might find in other companies where you can say you're a software shop and this is how the cost changes because now your cloud versus -- because we have a lot of expense in our P&L that is not related to technologies, related to service. So with that as a backdrop, we do think that it is helping us and will help us, which is why we're moving on these migrations as aggressively as we're moving. But it isn't, I think, as dramatic as you would find in a software technology company. The good news for us is some of the software -- pure software technology companies, that transition comes with lower revenues in the short term as you make a transition because they're not on a recurring revenue model. In our case, we've always been on a recurring revenue model, so there isn't as much change to our overall financial model other than maybe some help in terms of our cost structure long term as you might find in other places. So Jan, I don't know if you want to add to that? Jan Siegmund : Yes, referring to the first part of your question, if you look at our overall P&L, you notice that our systems and development and programming costs grew by approximately 10% for the year, a little slower in the quarter, and that acceleration of expense is in line with our strategy of focusing on innovation. So we anticipate, and we have talked in the past, about aligning our investments into R&D with revenue. So I think that cost line, you should not expect scale because we're committed to executing our innovation strategy in '15 for sure. Our sales and distribution and marketing costs are part, of course, of SG&A, and this year, SG&A grew about 5.5%, so we did gain scale, obviously, relative to our revenue growth. But the sales and marketing costs are largely driven by the new business bookings that we do, and we have talked in the past that we have gained productivity in that channel historically, so some very slight productivity improvements we would hope to gain also in '15. But that's, I think, is as specific as we can get for '15 for you. Those are the 2 big drivers that you alluded to and I hope that's kind of helpful. Carlos A. Rodriguez: And one last stat that, I think, helps in terms of -- to show our commitment to innovation and then also something that may not be obvious from the numbers that Jan just talked about in terms of our increase in system and development expense, which we're trying very hard to grow at an appropriate rate and not trying to drive scale from it. But in addition to that, 3 years ago, we set a target. We want to move the amount of spend that we have on new R&D or new cloud-based products compared to legacy products, and 3 years ago, that mix was about 40% on new and 60% on legacy. And the reason we know that number so well is because we actually included that in the MBOs of myself and the entire management team to move that number up, so that we can not only grow our total expense but grow the proportion of that expense that we're spending on new stuff versus legacy. And that number now has moved from 40-60 to 60-40, so we're spending a lot more on new, not just because of the absolute increase in expense, but also because of the change in mix of old versus new. Operator : We'll move on to Smitti Srethapramote of Morgan Stanley. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : This is Danyal Hussain calling in for Smitti. I just wanted to follow up on the PEO business. Obviously, it's done extremely well on organic basis, but Carlos, maybe you could just comment again on the potential to acquire some of those smaller PEO businesses out there, kind of in the same style that you've done with Payroll. Carlos A. Rodriguez: So it is -- I understand the comparison and we actually had some hopes over the years that we would be able to do that because we have done that fairly effectively in the Payroll business at times. But the 2 businesses are really completely different in the sense that in the payroll space, it's really one of, frankly, just a valuation issue. Does it make sense in terms of the economics because as you can hear, we're not interested in new platforms. So the question is, can we absorb financially and is it a net positive for our shareholders to acquire and roll up payroll businesses? In the PEO, it's slightly different because there's a risk component where what you acquire has underlying workers' compensation and health insurance risk, both in terms of renewal and in terms of just pure balance-sheet financial risk. And so we've been, over the years, looked at really frankly dozens of PEOs and we just never felt that we ran across something that made sense from a risk profile standpoint and the return we thought we might be able to get for our shareholders. So it's one thing to do the math on paper. When you introduce a risk element, then you have to risk adjust it, if you will, in terms of its potential downside, and we decided to just go it organically. And so we will continue to look as we always do because we're open-minded. I would count on us continuing to follow the path that we followed because it's been pretty successful. And ironically, the PEO is one place where when you hear us talk about migrations and multiple platforms and so forth, one might argue and might speculate that part of why the PEO has had all the success it had -- and I would attribute a small percentage of the success to this. But that simplicity and that focus on having one platform and just focusing on day-to-day execution and beating the competition and winning in the marketplace rather than being distracted by complexity and multiple platforms, I think, probably has helped them, and so we're not in any hurry to change that. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Got it. And maybe could you just comment on how attach rates have been trending and your price expectations for 2015? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Attach rates for, sorry, what products? Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Ancillary products on your ES segment. Carlos A. Rodriguez: So I'm glad you actually brought that up because I think I said that in the migrations, when someone asked the question about pricing, I said there's nothing to report, and it wasn't completely fair because even though on specific the payroll portion of what we're migrating clients on, there's been no discounting or unnatural acts. In general, we've actually benefited overall from a pricing standpoint as a company as clients have migrated because, in general, they've taken on additional products because of the opportunities that we have with integration of the multiple modules, if you will, being on a single database. And so I think those attach rates continue to be very good, in general, on new sales and also continue to hold up very well on our migrations. I think in Vantage, the time and attendance attach rate is somewhere in the 80% range, plus we're getting good attach rates on benefits and also on talent. And so we're very pleased because these are products that we used to have to sell first one product and then another product and then another product, and now, we're doing much better in terms of our attach rates up front in the sales process, as well as in the migrations. And when you look at our penetration rates of our various ancillary products, in general, of the base and you compare it to the attach rates on new sales, you would conclude that there's a huge opportunity there, but it's going to take many, many years to get there and there's a lot of execution risk along the way. But I just want to be clear that the attach rates on new business are multiples of what our penetration rates are in the base of benefits, time and attendance and some of our other products. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : And then pricing for 2015? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Oh, pricing for 2015 is very much in line with what we've been doing for the last 3 or 4 years, which is net price increase of around 1% through in terms of the impact that you would see from that in terms of our revenue and what the clients would experience in the marketplace. So we're still -- it's a competitive market space. Inflation is still low, and so we've -- historically, prior to the financial crisis, we were a little bit more, I wouldn't call it aggressive, but I think our price increases were healthier than they have been in the last 3 or 4 years, and there's no plan to change that in '15. Operator : I'm not showing any further questions in queue. I'd like to turn the call back over to Carlos Rodriguez for any further remarks. Carlos A. Rodriguez: Well, thank you very much for joining us today. As you probably could tell from our tone, we're very pleased with the results. When we report the year-end results, we don't always focus on the quarter, but we really had a great fourth quarter. And I just want to thank all -- the entire organization and all of our associates, including our sales organization, for delivering great results in the fourth quarter. We continue our shareholder-friendly actions, as Jan mentioned, through dividends and also share buybacks. We continue to be excited about the opportunities that the spinoff provides both for Dealer Services and for us, and we'll continue to update you along the way as we get closer to the date of the spin. I'm incredibly enthusiastic about the future as we begin 2015. This focus that we have on Human Capital Management has finally come to fruition here as a result of the spinoff, and I think all of our efforts and our focus are going to be in that space, which we believe is a great opportunity on a global basis. I want to thank you again for joining us, and this concludes the analyst call for today. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

My name is Kevin, and I'll be your conference operator. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to ADP's First Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Webcast. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I'll now turn the call over to Sara Grilliot, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Sara Grilliot : Thank you. Good morning. This is Sara Grilliot, ADP's Vice President, Investor Relations, and I am here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our First Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Call and Webcast. Before we begin, please note that ADP is planning to host a Financial Analyst Conference in New York City in the spring of 2015. We will provide further details in the coming weeks. Carlos will open today's call with an overview of our first quarter accomplishments and financial performance, and Jan will take you through our detailed financial results and our fiscal 2015 forecast. I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events, and as such, involve some risks. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Carlos. Carlos A. Rodriguez: Thank you, Sara, and good morning, everyone. We had a good start to fiscal '15 as we intensified our commitment to delivering innovative solutions to help our clients manage and optimize their workforce to meet their business needs. During the quarter, we continued to execute well against existing initiatives, including mobile adoption and cloud migration. We deployed new solutions to further differentiate ADP in the marketplace. And by successfully completing the spin-off for our Dealer Services business, we are now truly all-in on Human Capital Management or HCM. Going forward, our energy in investment is squarely focused on serving our clients across the full HCM spectrum, from recruitment to retirement. And while many companies are focused on technology alone, ADP is focused on the end-user and delivering value-added services powered by leading-edge technology. We are helping employers manage their most important asset, their people, by backing up our workforce management technology with comprehensive service and compliance expertise. Before I get to the quarter's performance, I would like to spend a few minutes talking about our commitment to HCM, which is supported by investments in innovation that drive our future growth. Our nearest Innovation Lab located in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City opened earlier this year and has become a catalyst for accelerated product development. The engineers in the lab, together with thousands of world-class ADP engineers across the globe, have driven a number of our recent product introductions. At the end of the quarter, we started to roll out our reimagined user experience, which we view as the ultimate convergence of innovation and intense client focus. The new user experience offers an intuitive and responsive platform, allowing employees to integrate critical HR processes into their daily work streams and creating a unique experience for employees. We plan to roll out this new user experience to 22 million payroll solutions users in North America by the end of calendar 2014 and across many other solutions in our portfolio throughout calendar 2015. Adding to our client-centric offerings, we recently introduced the ADP Marketplace, which opens up our platform and grant clients, partner companies and third-party developers access to our application programming interfaces, commonly known as APIs. This helps our clients more seamlessly integrate critical applications with our system of record, further optimizing the entire HCM process with our cloud platforms. And to help businesses manage one of the most critical challenges they face today, ADP recently expanded its suite of Affordable Care Act or ACA compliance tools. We believe ADP Health Compliance is the most comprehensive solution on the market and the only one able to manage all of the labor-intensive regulatory interactions between employers, their employees, government agencies and public exchanges. Featuring the new user experience, ADP Health Compliance is a perfect example of our innovative cloud-based technology backed by ADP's team of dedicated ACA and regulatory compliance experts. With many companies in the U.S. currently unprepared to manage ACA compliance, we believe we are hitting the market at just the right time with this solution. And we are proud to see that ADP solutions are being recognized. Forrester Research recently named ADP a SaaS HR management systems leader, citing our innovation, user-friendly platforms and expanding big data solutions as key drivers of improved workforce engagement. This endorsement from an independent adviser, whose key role is to help companies make savvy technology decisions, sends a clear message to potential clients : Our solutions will help you make decisions that will drive business success. So now for ADP's performance in the quarter. I'm pleased with the good performance we had to the start of the fiscal year. ADP reported revenue growth of 9%. Worldwide new business bookings growth was a solid 11%, and we continue to successfully drive client migrations to the cloud while improving profitability. During our fourth quarter call, I described our refined 3-pillar strategy focusing on the HCM market. I think the best way to discuss our first quarter growth in new business bookings is in terms of how it aligns to each of our strategic pillars. First, in the U.S., we saw growth across all of our strategic platforms, RUN, Workforce Now and Vantage, with solid attach rates, particularly for our benefits and talent modules. Performance in the upmarket was strong, with sales of Vantage contributing to our overall growth in the quarter. Second, our business process outsourcing solutions, which we offer across all segments of the market, from small to large businesses, had strong results during the quarter. The PEO continues to perform well with small businesses, and we also saw increased demand for our comprehensive services in comprehensive outsourcing products in the mid- and upmarket. Finally, we continue to leverage our global presence to offer clients HCM solutions where they do business. Our multinational solutions performed well in the quarter, with growth coming from small to very large multinational corporations. During the quarter, we continued to migrate clients to our newer cloud-based solutions. At the end of the quarter, more than 460,000 businesses were supported by our cloud services. We also continue to deepen ADP's engagement with clients and end-users through our success with mobile. We now have more than 3 million users on our mobile app, an increase of more than 18% in the last quarter alone. Our first quarter achievements are a reflection of an effective strategy, combined with the commitment of 52,000 ADP associates who are pushing everyday to deliver on behalf of our clients. And with that, Jan will now walk you through the first quarter results. Jan Siegmund : Thank you very much, Carlos. As you just heard, we had a solid first quarter. Before I get into the detailed results, I would like to call your attention, though, to our cash and marketable securities balance of $4.4 billion at September 30, 2014. This includes $2 billion of assets related to outstanding commercial paper in support of our extended investment strategy for the client funds portfolio and is footnoted in our condensed balance sheet. This borrowing was repaid on October 1. In addition, with the completion of the spin-off of Dealer Services to CDK on September 30, the results of operations of the Dealer Services business and spin-related costs associated with this transaction are now reported within discontinued operations. My comments will therefore be in reference to continuing operations. Now for the quarter's results. As Carlos mentioned, ADP delivered solid revenue growth of 9% for the quarter, nearly all organic. We achieved a pretax earnings growth of 12% and earnings per share growth of 13% on lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. In connection with the spin-off of Dealer Services, ADP sold a portfolio of notes receivables to a third-party, which contributed approximately $0.02 to our diluted earnings per share. Our combined worldwide new business bookings growth was a solid 11% over last year's first quarter. Employer Services revenue grew 7% from additions of net new recurring revenues to our global HCM solutions and our BPO offerings. Each of our businesses contributed to this quarter's growth. We remain focused on providing a world-class client experience, and we are pleased that our client revenue retention increased 70 basis points over last year's first quarter, though retention is lumpy from quarter-to-quarter and the first quarter generally has the smallest volume of losses. Same-store pays per control in the U.S. was strong with an increase of 3.1%. In Europe, same-store pays per control continues to flatten out, but still declined 0.2 percentage points in the first quarter. However, we are pleased with the overall revenue growth in our International business where we are seeing positive momentum in Asia Pacific and Latin America, as well as continued success with our multinational offerings. Growth in the average client fund balances was 7%, driven by our net new business growth, especially in the small and upmarket, as well as pays per control growth. Pretax margin expansion in Employer Services was 120 basis points in the quarter. Our businesses performed well, driving solid revenue growth with controlled increases in our operating costs. We continue to invest in our new products and in our sales force, and we anticipate year-over-year earnings pressure in the second fiscal quarter from these investments, which will result in about $30 million of additional expenses in the second quarter compared with a year ago. The PEO continues to perform very well, with revenue growth of 18% in the quarter. Average worksite employees grew 15% to 345,000. The increasingly complex HR regulatory environment and the compliance needs of small- to mid-sized business, combined with solid execution of our distribution model and the strength of ADP's offering, are key drivers of this growth. In addition to the solid revenue growth, pretax margin in the PEO improved 90 basis points in the quarter. The quarter's margin expansion was a result of increased operating and sales efficiencies. We're quite pleased with the results of our business segments for the first quarter. We're also pleased that overall ADP pretax margin improved by 50 basis points over last year's first quarter. Although our high-margin client fund interest revenues were slightly positive in the quarter, for the first time since 2008, the impact on ADP's pretax margin was still a drag of about 30 basis points, as these highly profitable revenues grew at a slower rate than overall revenues. We expect to see this drag lessen as the year progresses. So let me make -- let me take you through our outlook for fiscal year 2015, which was updated on September 29 to exclude the Dealer Services business. For total ADP, we anticipate total revenue growth of 7% to 8% compared to fiscal year 2014 to revenues of $10.3 billion. Pretax margin for total ADP is anticipated to improve by 75 to 100 basis points from 18.4% in fiscal year 2014. Although we benefited from a lower effective tax rate in the first quarter compared with last year, we still expect a rate of 34.6% compared with 33.9% in fiscal year 2014. Diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 12% to 14% compared with $2.58 in fiscal year 2014. This forecast of 12% to 14% includes a $0.02 benefit resulting from share repurchases funded by the $825 million in dividend proceeds ADP received as a result of the spin-off of CDK. However, the forecast does not contemplate further share buybacks beyond anticipated dilution related to equity comp plans and the dividend proceeds from CDK. And although our share repurchases in the quarter were lower than in prior quarters, ADP remains committed to its shareholder-friendly actions, and it is clearly our intent to return excess cash to our shareholders, depending obviously on market conditions. The high end of our revenue and earnings forecast ranges anticipate renewal of certain high-margin WOTC tax credits in the second half of the fiscal year. And although foreign currency fluctuation had a minimal impact on our first quarter results, a stronger U.S. dollar continuing throughout the balance of the year could put pressure on the full year revenue forecast. And finally, as I mentioned earlier, we anticipate having about $30 million of additional expense in the second fiscal quarter, which will moderate our earnings growth in that quarter. So now for the business segments. There's no change to our forecasted growth of new business bookings. We are still anticipating about 8% growth over $1.4 billion sold in fiscal year 2014. There's no change to our previous forecast for Employer Services. We still anticipate 6% to 7% revenue growth and 100 basis points of pretax margin expansion. Pays per control in the U.S. is still anticipated to increase 2% to 3%. For the PEO, we are still maintaining our revenue growth guidance of 13% to 15%, as we continue to assess opportunities related to the increasing complexity of the HR regulatory environment during the remainder of the year. And we are still anticipating up to 50 basis points of pretax margin expansion for the PEO. There is no change to our previous forecast related to the client funds investment strategy. The detail is available both in the press release and in the supplemental slides on our website. Now I will return it over to the operator to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from the line of David Togut with Evercore. David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Are there any significant changes we should expect, Carlos, in the way you manage ADP post the CDK spin? Carlos A. Rodriguez: I think the only -- I think we've communicated that -- I think we -- part of the reason for the spin-off is for us to just have more focus in terms of our time, our dollars, our energy on our HCM market and also to allow CDK to do the same thing in their industry and their business. So I can't -- I don't think there's really any radical news to really provide you other than that. We really believe that it's not a -- it wasn't a financial engineering transaction per se, it was really a strategic decision that we expect you to see improvement in our performance over time, because I think that increased focus and energy in investment in HCM. We did it obviously because we think it's going to pay off and have better results for our shareholders, but it's not a 1 quarter or 2 quarter decision. We can't point to anything that's happening in the first quarter or the second quarter specifically as a result of the spin-off. We just have confidence and faith, and I think our Board had confidence and faith that this will create greater value over the long term by having the 2 businesses separated. David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Understood. And just as a quick follow-up, you highlighted your progress in the ongoing migration to the cloud and mobile. Can you just remind us of the benefits from this migration, whether it be improved customer retention or upsell opportunity? Carlos A. Rodriguez: I'm not sure we have enough time today for -- to talk about all the benefits. But I'll talk about a couple, and maybe Jan can jump in because there really are many that we've now actually experienced and seen because it was all theory a couple of years ago, and now I think we're seeing some of the benefits. So starting with the fact that, if you think about in the old legacy products, the process of upgrading clients and rolling out new products was cumbersome, difficult and expensive. And I think our new kind of cloud-based version of those products are just much easier to roll out, much easier to upgrade. So there's huge benefits in terms of just frictional ongoing costs. The word cloud and SaaS, I think, can mean a lot of things to a lot of different people. But I think to us, it also means not just the technology, but also the consumer-grade experience, which means that they're easier to use, result in hopefully better serviceability and less need for support because they're more intuitive. So that I think also is something that we're beginning to see some benefits of. I think the most important reason for us to migrate these clients is because we believe these new platforms that we have are very successful commercially in the market from a sales standpoint in terms of new business. And if there's that much demand and they're so great for new clients, they must also be great for existing clients. So we just want to have all of our clients on our best products, is really the main driver for the migration strategy. I don't know if Jan has any other items to add. Jan Siegmund : I may want to add a little bit about the mechanics of where we are. So we did migrate another 20,000 RUN clients this quarter and really coming to the homestretch now to finalize that migration right along the plans that we had. So that we may not be 100% completed in this quarter but we'll be very close to execute, as we have talked now for many years. And we have seen an addition to a great client experience, of course, also a slight decrease in the complexity of business, which helps in the margin expansion from the down market. That's for sure. The migration of our mid-market product, PCPW, on to Workforce Now also continues at a good clip. We migrated about 1,500 clients there. And just as a reminder, we do see actually, when we migrate these clients, improvement in our retention rates and we -- about 30% of the clients actually utilize right at the migration upsell opportunities to buy broader product portfolios. And I think those factors you see really reflected in our overall results and certainly contributed to a smaller degree, but to some degree, in our good retention performance, as well as our good sales performance. Operator : Our next question comes from S.K. Prasad Borra with Goldman Sachs. Siva Krishna Prasad Borra - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : A couple, if I may. Firstly, on the new bookings, you had a strong first quarter, but you made no changes to the full year guidance. Is it just being conservative or is there a seasonality aspect we need to account for? And second one, can you provide some color on the attach rates associated with these new products? What is the difference between selling a standalone payroll offering and attaching things like benefits and talents to the payroll offering? Carlos A. Rodriguez: So I'll let Jan talk about the attach rates. In terms of the seasonality of the results, there is some seasonality. So our first quarter is our smallest quarter, not by a dramatic amount, but it is smaller than the other 3 quarters in terms of the total dollar amount of sales that we get from the first quarter versus the full year. So there is a bit of a seasonality impact. We also had a, what I would call a relatively easy compare because we had, as all of you know, a difficult first quarter last year. And so we feel like our forecast is still quite good, but also I think in the right range. So we're feeling good about our momentum in our results, but I don't think it's appropriate to extrapolate an 11% first quarter growth rate in new business bookings to anything higher than what we've provided in terms of guidance in the range. We don't have anything to lead us to believe now that, that should change because we obviously know other factors in our sales force like, for example, how much headcount we've added. And although we have had some positive surprises in the past around productivity, there tends to be a natural governor on sales results depending on what your headcount numbers are. So I think we have some metrics that tell us that I think our guidance is the right guidance. Jan Siegmund : On the attach rates, we really attach HR products at all segments to our products. And it's, of course, a very different experience if the product is completely seamlessly integrated in the workflow of the user. So it is not even a different product, there's just a different feature functionality that we open up in it. And we see in the upmarket, where we had a good quarter also for Vantage sales, stability in the attach rates, so ranging between 50% and 80%, depending on the product component. And in the mid-market, we saw actually slight increase in the attach rates for really all the core product components, benefits and time and attendance and talent namely for it. So the strategy of having a platform and to upsell or to have an easy ability for the client to expand their relationship with ADP has really proven to be successful for us, an important component of the sales growth that we observed this quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel Financial. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Just looking at the PEO business, I assume the strong 1Q at least -- or the strong growth in the first quarter versus the guide for the year at least partially reflects the increasing difficulty of the comparisons. So I guess, one, is that in fact the case? And can you also update us on what you view as the underlying drivers of that business, and again, the sustainability of those drivers as we get through this year and into next year? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Yes. I think the -- I think you're right, the compares do matter. I think there are a couple of other factors that are helping that we seem to be cautious about. One of them is that there is a premium tax that has been added to the health care offerings, this is by the carriers who then pass those costs through to the PEO. And as you know, the pass-through costs are relatively important in that business. Having said that, the worksite employee growth is still quite strong in the PEO, so it's not coming alone from inflation in our pass-through cost, but the inflation in the pass-through cost is a factor. So I would tell you that a better way to look at this business over the long term is to look at worksite employee unit growth, which is really the driver of growth in this particular business as a good proxy for what to expect in terms of the range. And I think when you look at it that way, and you look at the difficult compare that we have in the third quarter versus the previous third quarter, because we had a very good net new business result last year in this business, because of a variety of reasons around tax restarts, et cetera, tends to have a relatively large influx of new business and also we have a reasonable amount of loss that would take place on January 1. So you take all those things combined, kind of where we are trend-wise in terms of worksite employee growth, the fact that our pass-throughs are a little elevated right now and the difficult compare that we have on January 1 in terms of net new business, I think we think that the guidance that we're providing, I think, is appropriate. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : And then how about the sustainability going into next year? So we've got perhaps some distortions this year, but as you look into next year, do you see any changes in the landscape that would dramatically change the trajectory of this business? Carlos A. Rodriguez: So let me just go back in terms of -- I think I know what you mean by distortions, but just to reiterate one more time, the business is clearly performing -- is really firing on all cylinders in terms of absolute growth in units, margin improvement, new business bookings results. It's -- so they're really performing well. So I was really only addressing the issue of the specific growth of the first quarter in comparison to the full year results. So we expect this business to continue in the same positive momentum that we have guided to. So my comment was really more around whether the guidance was appropriate versus whether we're excited or positive about the business, because we are. And we don't expect or see any decelerations or issues in the near term in that business over the next several quarters or even into next year. But obviously, this is, I guess, why we talk about forward-looking statements. It's a long way away to start talking about next year. We obviously don't give guidance about next year, about the PEO or any other business. But we don't have any reason to believe that we can't continue the positive momentum. The backdrop for this business with health care reform has helped for sure in terms of activity of people looking for solutions and options around health care, just the regulatory compliance complexity that has grown not just the result of ACA, but just government regulation overall just continues to drive small businesses to look for solutions that can help them, allow them to focus on their business. And the PEO is about as good as it gets in terms of being able to really have someone else focus on those issues for you. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Great. And if I could just ask just one quick follow-up. And I think you got it. Jan answered part of this question previously. But now that we're pretty well into the deployment of some of the new HCM platforms, can you help us better understand how much of the ES growth comes from unit growth versus revenue per unit in contrast to kind of prior years, if you will? Jan Siegmund : Yes. So I -- we didn't get the question in our year-end call, and I can answer it now. Of course, last year, we had approximately -- unit growth of approximately 5% year-over-year, so a very solid client expansion, driven largely by our success in the downmarket, of course, where the most of the units came from. But we had really growth actually across all segments. And the answer is very hard to do because in the upmarket, we have higher market share and the proportion of upsell to clients is higher versus in the downmarket, it's virtually all new unit growth driven in the revenue growth. So like a curve, it balances out. And so it's a mix of it, and the mix hasn't really changed, as you see, because the unit growth has continued now for the third year in a row at these levels or slightly accelerated, if you want. And so it's not -- 50-50 is not the right way to do, but it's a balance of growth. Operator : Our next question comes from George Mihalos with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : I understand the easier comparisons in the first quarter related to new sales and also to retention. But I'm just curious, did the business perform above plan relative to your internal expectations in the first quarter, given the -- more of the second half difficulties around the comps? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Let me just -- let me start off by saying, again, in terms of clarifying my language when I -- and I think it's a financial term of hard to say easier compare, which is not well understood by field leaders because they certainly would not interpret the results as easy. So the -- as you can imagine, this -- to deliver the sales results regardless of what your sales results were last year, which is a financial question, is hard because you have to execute. Same thing with retention and client losses. Having said all that, since you're asking a direct question and we feel compelled to give you a direct answer, the direct answer would be that, yes, both the sales and retention results exceeded our internal plans, but I want to qualify that by saying that they exceeded them by an amount that is not significant enough for us to rethink and change our guidance. It's the nature of our business model that -- this recurring revenue model is so positive in so many ways, but it's also very, very difficult to change the trajectory in the numbers in one quarter, and that is exactly what happened this quarter. So we're very pleased when we exceeded our internal plans and budgets, but I don't know how many times I've had to be on this call and mention that retention in one particular quarter was down by 10 basis points because of a large loss or because they're lumpy. So what's good for the goose is good for the gander, it goes both ways. We happen to have had a good quarter and it's no reason to start moving, I think, expectations. At least from our perspective, that's where we stand today. Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay, I think we can appreciate that. And just as a follow-up, a question for Jan. Any reason why in the future you would not be open to adding leverage on the balance sheet, solely for the purpose of accelerating returns to shareholders, buybacks and the like? Jan Siegmund : Yes, what you mentioned is correct. In principle, we, of course, changed as part of the spinout of Dealer Services to CDK, our credit rating, and we have now a AA credit rating, which allows us more financial flexibility. And we are aware in evaluating the benefits that it has for us, offers a certainly greater financial flexibility either for returning cash to shareholders or pursuing strategic acquisitions. So we're aware and we're evaluating it, and we have a constructive dialogue about the opportunities. And when we feel we can generate shareholder value with it, we certainly think about these elements. Carlos A. Rodriguez: I think Jan and I both, I think consistently for several years now, talked about how we view the world in terms of total shareholder return or TSR, which obviously, dividends and share buybacks are an important component over long periods of time of driving our TSR to what our objective is, which is to be top quartile. So we appreciate the question because we're very sensitive to those topics and certainly are looking at all of our options to help, in addition to our revenue and margin improvements, to find other ways to really drive our TSR to that top quartile performance. Operator : Our next question comes from Smitti Srethapramote with Morgan Stanley. Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Your pay per control growth was quite strong at 3.1%. Can you just comment on what drove that growth rate this past quarter? Jan Siegmund : Well, it was strong and is, I think, a strength in line with the strengthening of the overall economy. ADP's clients tend to outgrow the U.S. economy over long run, so we are blessed with a very healthy set of clients. And the improvement was kind of -- we attribute more to the overall continued improvement in the U.S. labor market, and it happens to be a very good number. Carlos A. Rodriguez: And again, just to add context, the -- when you look at it over the last 2 or 3 years and quarter-by-quarter, it's higher than it has been for sure, but only by 30 to 40 basis points. It's kind of hovering in the mid-2s, and so we had a 3.1%. Again, I would just caution everyone that based on a lot of experience that we have, do not take 1 quarter and extrapolate. And if you feel compelled to extrapolate, you should know that the impact of 1 percentage point growth in pays per control is about $20 million annually, so a 30 to 40 basis point improvement if it were to remain for the rest of the year, which is hard to predict right now, would really not have a material impact on our result either on the top line or the bottom line for the year. Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Got it. And maybe just a follow-up question. Can you talk at a high level about the growth of the ASO or the BPO business? Does it look similar to what you're seeing in the PEO segment? And could these businesses drive an acceleration growth in the Employer Services segment? Carlos A. Rodriguez: I think as I mentioned in my opening comments, given that that's one of our strategic pillars, we, I think, specifically mentioned that besides the PEO, our other BPO offerings are actually growing quite nicely as well. And we have those BPO offerings in the low end of the market, the mid-market and the upper end of the market. In addition to the PEOs, the PEO is a separate segment and a different business, it obviously has tremendous synergies with the rest of ADP. But we actually have BPO offerings that are available also in the small market without core employment. We have them in the mid-market and we have them in the upper end of the market. And I -- again, Jan may add color. But all 3 of them are performing quite well and they're -- all 3 are growing, I think, at better than ADP line rates. Jan Siegmund : Yes. And I think relative to employees served growth, which is maybe then the common denominator about it, they're very similar rates. So it's a very success story -- it's a big success story for us. Carlos A. Rodriguez: And well into the market. If you combine our PEO worksite employees with our ASO paid employees, we don't call them worksite employees, paid employees, I think on a combined basis, I think you would find that over the last 5 to 7 years, it was a marathon, but I would say that we're probably comfortably right now, probably the leader in terms of offering BPO services in the low end of the market. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : I wanted to come back to the PEO segment for a second. Obviously, the growth is strong there. Do you guys think that you're taking share in that market? Any evidence to support that? Or do you feel that it's more the rising tide lifting all boats, just given the ACA and compliance burdens? Carlos A. Rodriguez: I think that if you look at it over 5 to 10 years, I think we have taken share in that business. I think if you look at the last year or 2, it would appear -- again, there's not a lot of great data because most of the PEOs are private -- privately held companies. But if you look at the publics, I think that the growth rate has improved. Some of that is -- it's hard to discern how much of it is acquisition-related versus organic. But we still feel pretty good that we're gaining share in that specific segment of our business. But we have to acknowledge that there appears to be also a rising tide, not quite to a level -- or execution, which is I think better than average or better than market average. But the market is healthy and appears to be growing at a reasonably good clip, which is not necessarily true over the last 10 years. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay, that makes sense. And just switching gears a little bit to pricing. I know that Paychex mentioned on their earnings call about a month ago that they were seeing slightly better pricing dynamics in their business. Have you seen something similar at the smaller end of your client base? Jan Siegmund : We stay consistent with our overall strategic pricing approach. And just for reminder, that is -- approximately 1% of our revenue growth is driven by our annual price increases across all segments. And anticipating your question in the down market, we actually did review our pricing statistics and behavior, and discounting behavior, and net pricing, and price increases for the business, and it is completely in line with our historic behavior in the marketplace, but no changes in our pricing strategy. Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital. Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : So RBC is a customer of your FSA product. I recently tried to log in to it through the ADP website, was unsuccessful, called the 800 number, and after several minutes trying to figure it out, it turns out we're actually a customer of the SHPS product that you acquired 2.5 years ago. I guess two-part question on that. First of all, is that sort of unique for some reason to the FSA that that's not been fully integrated into the legacy ADP offering? And secondly, are there any implications from that in terms of the ability to migrate people to the new integrated platforms and/or upsell other products or anything else? Carlos A. Rodriguez: It's a great question, it allows me to make a couple of comments. First of all, after the call, I'll give you my cell phone. If you ever have a problem, you can call me and I'll make sure that I get you through. I actually tried to log on to the FSA site Sunday night and had a challenge myself because they were doing maintenance. So I did call someone and they told me that they were doing maintenance, but I have the right phone numbers if you ever need help. So the SHPS acquisition is an interesting question because we actually acquired SHPS, in large part, to get that platform. So we are actually in the process of moving our legacy FSA clients on to the SHPS platform, which is really our platform, it's the ADP platform. Now -- so again, that was an example of where we decided to use our capital for acquisition rather than internal development because, as you know, we are doing a lot. I mean, our R&D spend has grown quite substantially over the last 3 years, but there are many things that we need to address in terms of legacy platforms, and our spending accounts was one of them. So one of the things that came with SHPS was an HSA solution, which is very important to have in today's market because of high-deductible health plans. So FSAs, as you may or may not know, have now been restricted in terms of the dollar limits are a little bit lower. They're still popular. I still have an FSA, but I think you have to have an HSA platform. And we tried to get -- to create a -- to get an HSA platform through acquisition, through the SHPS's acquisition. So that's really not a platform that we're actually trying to get off of. We're actually trying to get off of our old platform. And so we're kind of agnostic in terms of where it comes from, whether it's our platform or an acquired platform. We're just trying to get on to common platforms. And so this would be an example rightly so, where we are still not where we want to be in terms of having everyone on one common spending accounts platform and having it integrated into all of our other products. So I think it's the work in progress. And it allows me also to address the question that we got, I think it was the first question, around migrations, which is we still have a lot of work to do. So to be very clear because we're talking about all the progress we've made, you just kind of hit actually ironically on a chord because I asked the same question 2 years ago when we were looking at a demo of one of our products. My question was, \"Well, how does FSA integrate into this?\" So we still have a lot of work to do, and we've actually accelerated our migration spend this year and we've also accelerated our R&D spend, which that one is much more clear because you see it in the 10-Q and you see it in our disclosures. But we are nowhere near yet where we want to be, particularly when you get into the upper end of the market. I think we've made that clear over the last 2 or 3 quarters. But I just wanted to reiterate that in our upper-end payroll HR benefit spending accounts, like there is still quite a lot of work to do, but we are doing that work. And we have, I would say, significantly increased our spend in the upmarket migrations area, and spending accounts would be one of those. Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Great. And then that leads into the follow-up, which is just I think one of the bull cased [ph] arguments on ADP some investors have had is that at some point, you actually see cost decline quite a bit from turning off legacy systems and slowing the migration spend. From that last comment, I guess, would a reasonable assumption be that, that's still more than 12 months away? Or I know you probably don't want to give us a number. But it's still quite a ways off before you would have that benefit happen if it does at all. Carlos A. Rodriguez: That is correct. And I think that what's going to be good this year is that by the end of the year, we'll be able to tell you that we shut down completely the EasyPay platform and that it resulted in the benefits of X, Y and Z. So we will be able to at least begin to better quantify some of the benefits and positives of shutdowns of platforms. And then besides EasyPay, which is a major platform in our low end of the market, we have 3 platforms in the mid-market that we are planning on shutting down and a couple in the upper market as well. This will be the first time -- as much as we've been talking about this, it's really been about migrations and not shutdowns. We're actually this year going to start shutting things down. And I think we'll at least be able to give you, I think, a little bit more color on what potential benefits might come. But right now, for the next 12 months and probably sometime beyond that, our strategy is to reinvest everything that we are getting as a result of improvements into accelerating that type of activity, the migrations and the shutdowns. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim MacDonald with First Analysis. James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division : Just one more on the PEO. The growth of worksite employees decelerated a little bit this quarter to 15% from 18.9% even though it's sort of the summer period. Could you talk about that a little bit? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Yes. I think it's one of those peculiarities, I believe, of how our sales force behaves, which I talked about a little bit over the last year and probably a little too much. But our fiscal year ends on June 30, and the PEO had, what I would call, a spectacular year-end from a fiscal year-end standpoint. And I think it's as simple as that. That was what's driving it. Because I think if you look at it trend-wise prior quarters to that fourth quarter, I think it would be more in line with where we are today. So I think if you look at it on a moving average basis over 4-quarter moving average, I think that business is accelerating in terms of its worksite employee growth. James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division : Okay, great. And now that you're focused totally on HCM, can you talk about your acquisition philosophy? Would you be willing to add new areas, make bigger acquisitions? Just kind of what you're thinking is there. Carlos A. Rodriguez: I think, again Jan will probably add color. But our position hasn't changed at all as a result of our spinoff of Dealer or our change in our credit rating other than we clearly have much more financial flexibility now. So I think we had always communicated to all of you and to The Street that we would be willing for the right acquisition to change our capital structure. I think what happened was we have the benefit now of our capital structure... [Technical Difficulty] Operator : [Operator Instructions] Carlos A. Rodriguez: Okay. If we're back on, we apologize for the interruption. And we wanted to continue with answering your questions. I think, Jim, if you're still connected, I think your question was around acquisitions and if our view has changed as a result of the spinoff. And I think my answer was that I think we're still kind of consistent with our prior philosophy, which is we want to use our capital both for organic growth and product development. But we also are open to -- and that's really our primary focus, but we're also very open to the right types of opportunities to use our capital for acquisitions. And I think we just talked a few minutes ago about how we believe that we accelerated our progress in terms of FSA and spending accounts through the acquisition of those SHPS platforms a couple of years ago. And we will continue to look at those types of opportunities in the future. So one of the benefits that we have, and I think Jan talked about it earlier, is that the spinoff of Dealer really did kind of ease the path for us, if you will, in the sense that there really wouldn't be -- there's likely to not be a change in credit rating as a result of our need to access the capital markets either for returning cash to shareholders or for an acquisition, unless that acquisition were to be obviously much larger than the average typical acquisition that we like to do. So Jim, I hope that answered your question. I hope you're still connected. Operator : Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with Sanford Bernstein. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : It's Lisa. I have a question about competitive dynamics. Are you seeing higher win rates in the lower end of the market. Do you perceive that you're gaining share there? And then in the upper end of the market, you've mentioned that Vantage had a fairly strong quarter. To what extent in the upper end of the market do you go to market independently? Or to what extent do the competitive dynamics among the software vendors, like SAP, Oracle, Workday, et cetera, impact you in and around your partnerships, your go-to-market partnerships with them? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Well, it's a great question on the -- and again Jan can add maybe his view. But I think on the upper end of the market, we really have a situation of coopetition with many of our -- of all the companies you mentioned. So we compete head-on in many respects for the entire HCM bundle, but we have a variety of solutions, for example, wage garnishments, standalone tax and other solutions, that we would provide in partnership with some of our -- what some of you might consider to be our competitors in the upper end of the market. We believe we have very good relationships and very good integration arrangements with really all of the competitors that you mentioned and a few others. And I think we believe that, that's the right posture for us to have in the marketplace because we want to be in on deals and we want to have our foot in the door so that we have an opportunity, having the broadest solutions of any provider out there. I think us having a logo or a relationship with the client is very important and very advantageous for us down the road to be able to attach and add on additional products. So we do cooperate as well as compete with all of those players in the upper end of the market. And I think your other question was in the low end of the market around market share. I think consistent with our prior comments over the last probably year to 2 years, we believe that we're growing faster than the market. And how much of that is shifts from software, pure software, to cloud-based software or to cloud-based software with support and service, which is what we provide in regulatory compliance, it's hard to know how much of our growth coming from shifts in the market versus direct market share takeaways from a specific competitor. So we don't have that level of information, that level of detail, but we do know that we're growing faster than the Small Business market is growing overall. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Terrific. And then just a quick follow-up on the PEO. Can you give us a flavor for what the customer retention is like in the PEO business? Like does it differ materially from the Employer Services business? And how many -- what's the mix of PEO clients that actually come out of Employer Services versus their sort of new greenfield wins? Carlos A. Rodriguez: So obviously, we don't disclose retention segment specifics, so this would probably be a bad time to start. To give you a scent of kind of where it is, it is -- if you look at the low end of our business, the average-sized client in our PEO is about 30 worksite employees. And so it falls squarely in what we call the Small Business market, the SBS market. The retention rates of those businesses, just because of natural dynamics that occur in that business or in that segment of the business, is lower than our average. So I think we right now are at around 91% annual retention, so our large national accounts would have a higher than 91% retention and our Small Business clients would have lower than 91% retention. So the PEO, because of the size client that they address, would be in that category of between 80% and 90% retention, below the average. But we'd rather not get into specifics. But we're quite pleased and quite happy with the retention rates and the trends of those retention rates. And from the few that we see that we have visibility to in the outside market, we feel ours compares favorably. And I think there was another question. Jan Siegmund : A question regarding the sources of our business. And this has to be answered like in a very clear way. Our broad field sales force in SBS and in major account has an incentive to generate leads that are suitable for the PEO. And such, the sales forces provide lead flow and opportunity into our core PEO sales force. And that's an important component of how we generate business. But those sales forces in SBS and major accounts are both to existing clients and new clients. And, of course, in the SBS downmarket, the larger component of this is really clients that are really newly identified as potential targets to the PEO. So the conversions of RUN clients onto the PEO is of lesser importance in this business. So this is really good, new unit growth that we're getting in the PEO. Operator : Our next question comes from Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I was hoping to get a little bit more color around the 11% growth in new business bookings. It sounded like it was strong across the board. Did you see much improvement with large clients? Last quarter, you had talked about new business transfer clients with more than 10,000 employees being down. And I'm wondering if you saw a change in that trend. Carlos A. Rodriguez: This is a great opportunity for me to provide some comments in the sense that I believe that some of my focus, and I take accountability for this last year after the first quarter, on individual portions of our sales results, individual business units, I think it was counterproductive both competitively and also internally in terms of a distraction to our own organization. So that's why we worded our opening comments the way we did, which is we're trying to tie our new business bookings results and explanations to kind of our broad strategic pillars rather than kind of specific segments because it was counterproductive to have done so. Having said that, because we spent so much time on it, I think it's appropriate this quarter, but we will try to avoid doing this, as much as we've done it in the past, in the future. I think it's okay to be a little more specific so that you have comfort because of some of the noise that we've had over the last 3 or 4 quarters, we had strong, very strong sales results across the board both in our traditional under 10,000 market as well as with large clients, with multinational clients in benefits, in RPO really across the entire national accounts segment. And the results were as strong in this quarter as they were weak last year in the first quarter. And that is really all I can say other than when you look at the numbers, it's quite impressive because of the gap. But that doesn't necessarily mean that in absolute dollars, if anything, other than what we want and need in order to grow the business. It's just that we had such a bad first quarter last year that the difference is quite stark. And back in -- I guess, the best way to summarize it is we're happy we're back where we want to be in terms of our performance in our upmarket. And our intention is in future quarters to try to not be as specific. Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And then 2 follow-up questions. The first is, with Vantage, as you're going out to existing clients and asking them to convert, can you talk to us about how those conversations are going, if you're providing any incentives for them to convert and how the sales force will balance migrations versus new sales? And then second, separately, last quarter, when you had given guidance, you talked about $30 million of investment in both the first quarter, and then also the second quarter. Did you make that $30 million in the first quarter? I'm wondering if the margin expansion incorporated that $30 million. Carlos A. Rodriguez: I'll let Jan answer the question about the investments and the margins. In terms of the question about existing clients moving over to Vantage, so we had -- at the beginning as we rolled out Vantage, I think in the first 50 sales that we had, I don't think any of them -- maybe 1 was a migration. I think in the next 50, we had maybe a couple more. I think now we are really including in the Q some existing clients that we want to move over. But it's still a relatively limited number. Like most of our Vantage sales are new logo, new share type of deals with very high attach rates for all the HCM modules. But there are obviously circumstances where it makes sense both because we think it's the right thing for the client and some of it is driven by just demand from clients wanting to migrate. So for example, in our HR Tech Conference or our Meeting of the Minds conference, we show these products, we talk about them, so it's kind of -- and we're very excited about them, and they're great solutions. So it is difficult to talk them up, and then tell people, \"Sorry, but they're not available.\" So we are now beginning to move some clients, a limited number of clients, on to Vantage, and we are -- we're working hard to build capacity to do that because we have to do both the new share and new logo business as well as the migration. So it's a matter of just creating and adding capacity from an implementation standpoint. In terms of incentives, the good news about Vantage and also about Workforce Now is that these new platforms really make it natural to purchase more than just the traditional payroll solution that ADP was known for, hence, our focus on HCM. So the attach rates of time and attendance and benefits administration and talent and some of the other modules are -- in some cases, they're up to 80%. So there is a natural incentive as a result of additional revenues to the company, which our sales force gets credit for and get commissions for. So I don't think it's an incentive issue. I think that it's really a capacity and execution management issue. Jan Siegmund : And if I went to your question of the incremental cost that we guided to at the end of our last -- of our year-end call a quarter ago, we talked about incremental expense pressure driven by our investments into IT and some acceleration of our investment in our sales force for the first 2 quarters, $30 million in each quarter. And yes, we did incur incremental cost in this quarter slightly better than the $30 million, so we didn't quite spend as much money as we thought to. But a large component of this materialized and is in our results. And I think I would expect the same split for the second quarter, about half on sales force expense and half on IT acceleration. If you kind of want to place it on your P&L, that's what will occur. Carlos A. Rodriguez: And another thing I would add is that we also had a couple of -- which we disclosed, a couple of things that helped us in the first quarter that are not occurring in the second quarter. And so it will be easier to see the difficulty of the additional investments in the second quarter compared to the first quarter because we did get some help in the first quarter that we hadn't anticipated. Otherwise, we would have included it in the guidance. Operator : Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : I just want to ask about the increased use in mobile. Does that bring in -- does mobile bring any additional revenue opportunity? And then I guess, on the flip side, on the cost side, is it just an additional cost? Or can that lower the cost to serve ADP clients? Carlos A. Rodriguez: We do believe that it has an impact on the cost side because a number of actions that people would take, both practitioners and employees, the things that they might be able to do themselves on their mobile devices are really issues that we would avoid either calls or avoid emails or chats or texts or whatever method people choose to communicate with us to ask a question or to get service. So I think there is some benefit in terms of lower cost for ADP as a result of some of our mobile solutions being out there. But I think there's a couple of other very positive impacts. I don't think that we can attribute directly revenue, so we can't tell you that we're advertising, for example, on to our mobile platforms and generating advertising revenue. But I can tell you that the connections and the relationships we're building with the employees of our clients in addition to the traditional relationships we have with our clients are very, very helpful in terms of our sales and our client retention. So as an example, if you go to the App Store, like the ADP app, believe it or not, is one of more popular business apps out there for the simple reason that people can check their -- it's not just about checking your pay and whether you got paid and how much went into your direct deposit, but you can check also your -- you can clock in, clock out if you are an employee that has a time and attendance system with ADP. You can actually do your open enrollment and choose your benefits. You can check for a doctor. I mean, there's just an endless number of things that you can do on the mobile devices and that just creates stickiness and a stronger relationship and a deeper relationship with our clients, not only at the practitioner level but at the employee level as well. So we believe that it's helping us in many ways in terms of the growth of our new business bookings. It's probably helping us with our retention. But we really can't point to specific metrics to tell you that it had X impact on either of those. We just know that it's helping. And down the road in the future, there may be other monetization opportunities. But at this point, that really hasn't been our focus. Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : And then just as a follow-up, curious to know now what percentage of revenue now comes international. And then with that, just particularly interested in Europe and what you're seeing out of Europe since a lot of concern about the European economy still. Carlos A. Rodriguez: So I think Jan will give you kind of the percentage and the details. I think that we're -- we have to say that we're pleased with -- given the backdrop in Europe, we're pleased with the new business bookings results in the first quarter and with the revenue growth, which as you can imagine, are both lower than the line averages that we're reporting both from new business bookings overall for ADP and revenue growth for ADP overall. So our international business obviously includes more than just Europe, it includes our multinational solutions, it includes Latin America and it includes Asia-Pac. And when you add all those together, those are actually quite close to our -- despite the drag from Europe, are quite close to the line average of ADP. But I think in view of the backdrop, I would have to say that we're quite proud of the performance of our business in Europe. And I think Jan may have a little more color around pays per control, retention and those kinds of things. Jan Siegmund : Yes. I think, Carlos, you captured the vast majority on the revenue side, international revenues roughly in line with our overall ADP revenue. Europe is a slight drag but really doing well. And that is paired with a good bottom line performance in Europe, where they kind of saw the overall results of the performance in Europe are really quite good in this quarter. And you have been -- I have been dancing around the pays per control numbers now for quite a few quarters in Europe with seeing silver linings coming closer. And we did have 1 month where we were actually slightly positive in the quarter, so too early to call it a sunrise there, given also the kind of more historic economic reports that we receive out of Europe. But gradually, it has been improving, and we're now basically flat as I talked about a 20 basis points decline. So flat on the pays per control side paired with the performance that Carlos described, Europe has had a good quarter. Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : And Jan, what is the percentage of international revenues now as a total? Jan Siegmund : Yes, that's it, I apologize. Approximately 20% for ADP. Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : 20%. And then just lastly on that, so is Europe improving? Or is it actually getting worse just when you're looking at the trend line? Jan Siegmund : If you want a trend line, ever so slightly improving. Operator : Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research : Carlos, you talked about the ACA [ph] compliance tools that you have now. Do you find those tools as a retention of clients tool? Or will you be able to price? And is there a revenue opportunity with those tools? Carlos A. Rodriguez: It is clearly a revenue opportunity. So we have -- I mean, I'm sorry, but clearly to us, maybe not to anyone else. But the level of complexity that is involved in compliance with ACA is quite high. And I think in our view, the model that we have is again as usual for us, it's not only technology, it's also expertise. And so that really will be our differentiator. So where others might just kind of add an additional report, which makes it sometimes harder to monetize, we are really building capabilities to help people make decisions, so decision support tools as well as expertise from people. And right now, we actually have sold a number of clients, these are incremental sales dollars with additional annual recurring revenues with our ACA compliance solutions. And I think we've only had it out in the market 3 or 4 weeks or a couple of months, a couple of months. And so I think we're very positive or very bullish on what the take rate is going to be and the attach rate is going to be. We have had a few Vantage sales that had ACA attached to them, and it was pleasing to see the attach rates of ACA in addition to kind of the traditional time and attendance benefits administration, et cetera. So again the caution here again would be on $10 billion in revenue and $1.5 billion in sales, if you want to -- our sales plans for ACA for this year would not be something that would register on your radar screen. But call it, 12, 24, 36 months out, it could be an important element of our sales growth, which we will -- if it gets to that point, we will obviously let you know. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research : And then just as a follow-up, you talked about the improving client retention. I think you've talked about 2 things that have helped are maybe the cloud-based system and a little bit easier comps. Is there anything else that's changed that's helping you improve retention in terms of maybe comp or how you're going about interacting with clients? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Well, I think that one factor that I probably should have mentioned earlier, and I'll say it now, is one of the ways that I've described it to some of our associates internally as to why and one of the reasons we wanted to move aggressively on these migrations is I described our situation a few years ago as our competitors are really fishing in an ocean when they were competing against us in our legacy platforms. Then it was kind of started to reduce that ocean to a lake in terms of taking clients that were, in my opinion, vulnerable. As a result though, they're still getting good service and still getting solutions that help them with whatever needs they had, but it didn't have kind of the consumer-grade experience and the ease of use that I think some of our new platforms have and didn't have the integration. And so we went from an ocean for people to fish in, our competitors to fish in, and I would say these are competitors in both the low end and the mid-market, and in some cases, in the high end but mostly in the mid-market and the low end. And we took that from an ocean to a lake. And I think we're getting close to the point where we're going to reduce their fishing area to a pond. And I think that is part of what you're seeing in terms of the retention rates that I think we are in a better position -- we're in a much better position offensively in terms of our product set, but we're in a much better position also defensively in terms of being able to protect our client base. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with R.W. Baird. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : I just wanted to follow up a little bit on that in terms of taking the ocean down to a pond. Can you talk about the migration that you would anticipate on the upper end in terms of moving to Vantage, how long you think that would take? And how do you -- how are you -- the commentary that you made about the ocean to the pond, does that apply to the upper end? And then... Carlos A. Rodriguez: Not yet. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. So when would that -- when would we start seeing that apply? And then secondly, you've gotten a lot of new logos on Vantage. Who are you taking them from? Carlos A. Rodriguez: So I think that we -- again we hate to be boring, but we have a lot of detail around where we get our clients from in the upper market because they're obviously specific clients. They're big enough that we know them specifically where they come from, what they were using before. We also have the same information for clients that we lose. So we have our wins and we have our losses, where they go. And unfortunately, there really isn't -- I think I said this numerous times and it hasn't changed that there really isn't one specific competitor or category even. So we take our fair share of kind of on-premise software, but we also take our fair share from other cloud-based outsourcers like us. And so there's really -- I wish I could tell you that there's a specific pattern, but there isn't, which is a good -- in my opinion, is a good thing, because we don't see any one competitor that is creating an enormous problem for us. And we also don't see any one competitor where it's kind of easy pickings for us. So I think it's fairly balanced across the board. On your comment about Vantage and the upper end of the market, I do think that we still have work to do there to improve both our -- I mean, our offensive position, I think, is much better than it was. But we are working very, very hard and investing significant amounts of dollars in making sure that we have the same kind of situation competitively in the upper end of our market that we have in the mid-market and the lower end of the market. And at the risk of sounding too bold because I think, as you repeated it, it may have sounded a little arrogant and bold to say that we've created a pond now. That may have been a better term to use internally than it would have been externally because there's really no way for ADP to ever be a pond for people to fish in because we are the biggest and we have the largest market share without any question. So the question is not whether we will be viewed as a pond or an ocean, we will always be viewed as an ocean. The question is what will be the success of the fishermen in our ocean. And I think we have gradually reduced the success rate and we intend to continue to do that. But we will always be a very large target because we are very large. And by the way, we're pretty proud of that because I think that indicates we've been doing something right for the last 65 years. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : I fully appreciate that, Carlos, and I fully understood what you meant by the pond. I was just wondering in terms of that migration, how -- is this -- would this be a 2-year, 3-year, 4-year kind of process? How should we think about that on... Carlos A. Rodriguez: We've taken some actions to supplement our resources, our migration resources with, for the first time, with external resources. And we're not going to get into a lot of details about who or how. But it's a meaningful commitment with a third party to help us with acceleration of our migrations. And we will let you know as that progresses, how it's going because it hasn't started yet. And so we're optimistic that, that will help accelerate our progress. But frankly, we don't have anything to report now. We'll let you know as that moves ahead. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. And then one last one just on Vantage in terms of the new sales. Would you expect the new sales performance on the upper end to be as strong as it would be in the mid and the small for this year? Carlos A. Rodriguez: In the mid and the low end of national accounts or in... Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : No, in national accounts, would you expect it to be a strong as it will be in mid and the small in terms of your plans? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Of overall ADP, yes, we do. In case it wasn't clear, in the first quarter, our national account of Vantage sales were a multiple in terms of growth rates of our mid and low end of market. Operator : Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I'll be quick. Just on -- just wanted to ask about some takeaways that we got from the HR Technology Conference, which is that it seems like a lot of the SaaS and tech-oriented HR providers were starting to invest more on the servicing side with specialists, et cetera. And I'm curious if you're starting to see a little bit of convergence, like with ADP obviously missing greatly and technology doing a nice job there. But also on the flip side, the SaaS players are going to invest more in outsourcing elements. I'm curious if you're seeing that in the marketplace. Carlos A. Rodriguez: We haven't felt it or seen it because we don't -- I think that's something that maybe all of you would have a greater sense of, but we're happy to see that other people are seeing the value in our business model and coming to our way of doing business. Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. No, I just wanted to check, figured you'd be a good person to check on that. And just for Jan, just on the FX side, obviously I know that you've mentioned FX could have some impact on revenue. But how about the sensitivity to earnings on FX? Can you walk us through what the sensitivity is there? Jan Siegmund : Yes. Thank you for the question. The good part about ADP is that our expenses and revenues on the international sides are well aligned, so the translation risk that we have on the FX is moderated, of course, by having the 2 components of the P&L being parallel. So I said now FX rates can be volatile, so we don't really forecast them, and we take them as they come. But my comments were leading to we had minimal impact of FX in the first quarter. But at current rates, there could be some, I think maybe 1 percentage point or so if the rates were to stay where they are on the revenue side. But I don't think we would impact our bottom line forecast for overall ADP based on the FX impact. It's not as meaningful on the bottom line. So it was really a comment just made for revenue growth that there could be an impact, but it should not impact to the same degree or to a much smaller degree really on the bottom line for us. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos A. Rodriguez: So thank you for joining us today. As you can see, we're very focused on delivering against our HCM strategy. We're going to continue to combine our expertise and our technology strength. And I think hopefully it's obvious that we're in a great position to help our clients successfully manage their most important asset, their people. I also want to make one other comment, which is next week, I actually reach my 3-year anniversary as CEO. And I want to thank my leadership team and the 52,000 ADP associates for all that they do every day and all that they've done over the years because the one thing I've learned over the last 3 years is it's a lot easier to sit around and prepare for conference calls and report results than it is to deliver the great results that we've had. So I want to thank all of them and specifically also my leadership team. And I want to thank you for joining us today, and we'll see you at the next -- and we hope that you will join us for the next conference call. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may all disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to ADP's Second Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Webcast. I like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. And all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I'll now turn the conference over to Ms Sara Grilliot, Vice President, and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Sara Grilliot : Thank you. Good morning. This is Sara Grilliot, ADP's Vice President, Investor Relations, and I am here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter fiscal 2015 earnings call and webcast. Before we get started with Carlos's commentary on the quarter, I want to give you an update on our Investor Day. The event will be held on March 3rd in New York City and we have an exciting agenda plan that will showcase our new products and include an update on our business and strategic initiative. We look forward to seeing you there.  I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events, and as such, involve some risks. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Carlos. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you, Sara. And good morning, everyone. This morning we reported solid results for our second quarter of fiscal 2015 including revenue growth of 7% and worldwide new business growth of 15%. During the quarter, we increased the number of businesses in the cloud to 480,000 and migrated 22 million users to our new user experience, providing them with a new way to access the pay information. And since last year we have more than doubled a number of mobile users to 3.6 million. And we are on track with our client migrations. And are pleased that we have migrated almost all of our small business clients to ADP RUN. We now have fewer than 2,000 clients left on the legacy EasyPay platform. We are excited as we prepared to sunset this platform in the coming week. A continued progress was made possible by our investments and innovations and our laser focus on leading in the Human Capital Management or HCM market. We remain optimistic as our strengthening portfolio of strategic platforms continued to experience success in recent months. The success is evidence by our year-to-date record client revenue retention in both the US and internationally. And our strong new bookings growth as clients of all sizes are seeing the value in ADP's integrated offerings and the value we provide and helping them manage their workforce.  In the US, we continued to be focused on growing our suite of integrated cloud based HCM solutions and we are pleased with the number of new clients choosing our flagship platforms ADP RUN, Workforce Now and Vantage as well as the adoption rates of additional modules by our existing client base. Our HR business processing outsourcing solutions especially our PEO continue to perform quite well as businesses look to fully outsource increasingly complex HR processes to ADP. To further enhance our capabilities, during the quarter we launched ADP Health Compliance targeted primarily at larger enterprises. This new solution which ADP is uniquely positioned to deliver helps businesses navigate the challenging and complex landscape associated with ACA healthcare compliance. We are optimistic about the interest we've seen from clients and the opportunity this represent. We are also keenly aware of our opportunity in the HCM space outside of the US. And although the European economic situation remains a challenge, ADP's strength global compliance and our presence in 100 countries has contributed to our success internationally. Not only have we seen solid execution in sales for multinational corporation, but we continue to enjoy a leading position abroad for our in country solution. Overall, we are pleased by the balanced success we are seeing across our portfolio. And we are constantly looking for ways to provide better, value added services for all of our clients whether they are small businesses or multinational corporation. We continue to sharpen our focus and evolve the end-to-end client journey leveraging our unique insights and expertise to create a more integrated and seamless client experience. We also understand that no two companies have the same need but the same way of doing business. So providing flexibility and adaptability of our market leading solutions is essential. For this reason we introduced the ADP market place earlier this fiscal year which is designed to help employers make the most of their workforce data by empowering partner companies and developers to deliver new and innovative applications that leverage and integrate with ADP's data.  The openness of the ADP market place which is enabling to access to our Application Programming Interfaces or APIs, enables workforce data integration across multiple workforce management platform, provides client with a more seamless and efficient HR process and lets clients extend the value of their relationship with ADP. In the three months since launch, our development team has begun working with potential partners. We are excited about the opportunity it provides for ADP to collaborate with third party developers and providing solutions that help our client better manage their workforce. And as we leverage ADP's unique big data capability, we are delighted with the launch of our ADP Workforce Vitality Report this October. The new report from the ADP research institute is unique in its ability to provide insight into the health of the US labor market. Not just job numbers but the quality of job and the trends driving its momentum. When considered together with our well regarded national employment report, we are sending a clear message to the market that ADP is at the forefront of identifying, analyzing and driving actionable insight in the HCM's space. In that regard we are also encouraged by the demand we are seeing for ADP's analytic solutions which are particularly strong among our up market client. We introduced these solutions just one year ago. And while the product is still in its early stages, we are enthusiastic about future opportunities for ADP to leverage our big data capability. In summary, we have entered the back half of our fiscal year on solid footing. While we certainly understand and are aware of the changing dynamics in the HCM's space, we are confident that our robust offerings and insightful expertise will enable to maintain and extend our leadership position. Again, thank you very much for your continued interest in ADP and I look forward to speaking with many of you at our Investor Day on March 3rd. With that I'll turn the call over to Jan to walk you through our second quarter results. Jan Siegmund : Thank you very much, Carlos. And good morning, everyone. I am pleased with ADP's results for the quarter. Revenue grew 7%, nearly all organic. Pretax earnings grew 8%. The effects of foreign currency translation negatively impacted the quarter's revenue and pretax earnings growth by approximately one percentage point. As Carlos described, ADP's sales force executed well in the quarter, delivering combined worldwide new business bookings growth of 15% over last year's second quarter. And as expected investments in our products and sales force moderated earnings growth in the second quarter. Earnings per share grew 8% which included a negative impact of about 1% due to foreign currency translations.  Our tax rate in the quarter was higher than last year's second quarter. However, better than we anticipated due to an expected one time tax benefit. ADP continued its shareholder friendly actions, repurchasing over 5 million shares in the quarter at a cost of $436 million. And as a reminder, ADP received $825 million in dividend proceeds from CDK as a result of the spin-off which occurred on September 30th, which were intended to fund share repurchases and accordance with the tax free nature of the spin. We intend to complete this share repurchases by June 30, 2015 subject to market conditions. Employees Services revenue grew 4% from addition of new recurring revenues tool from our HCM solution. This growth rate was impacted by almost two percentage point from foreign currency translation. As well as higher revenues received in last year's second quarter from administering employment tax credit for our clients here in the US. And certain one time benefit we experience in last year's quarter which all resulted in a more difficult compare. Despite the more difficult compare and the growth headwinds we experience from foreign currency translation, we continue to be pleased with the fundamentals of our business model. Our client revenue retention which is at a year-to-date all time high and improved slightly over last year's second quarter. Same store pays per control in the US remain strong with an increase of 3% and client fund balances grew 7% driven by net new business growth as well as growth in pays per control. As a reminder, approximately 15% of our client fund balances are held outside the US, most notably in Canada, the UK and in the Netherlands, so although our year-to-date balance growth is at the high end of our forecasted range of 5% to 7% for the full year, we anticipate coming in closer to the mid point of the range due to expected pressure from foreign currency translation in the next two quarters. We continued to be pleased with the overall revenue growth in our international business. As the positive results in Asia Pacific and Latin America as well as the success of our multinational offerings have continued. And although the economic situation in Europe continues to be sluggish, same store pays per controls was flat over the last year's second quarter following several period of decline. Our pretax margin expansion Employees Services was 30 basis points in the quarter. Our business continues to perform well, however, anticipated higher selling expenses and planned investments into products cause margin pressure over last year's second quarter. The PEO continues to outperform posting another quarter of strong revenue growth of 18% compared to last year's second quarter. Average worksite employees grew 15% to $354,000. The solid execution of our sales force and the strength of our distribution model continued to be a key driver of our growth.  We are also pleased that efficiencies in sales and operations continue to drive margin expansion in the PEO which delivered about 140 basis points of improvement in the quarter. ADP's consolidated pretax margin improved by 30 basis points in the second quarter, which included a drag of about 20 points from slower growth of our high margin client fund revenues as these highly profitable revenues grew at slower rate than overall revenue.  So now I'll take you through our fiscal year 2015 outlook which has been updated to reflect the results we have seen in the first half of the year as well as the expected impact of foreign currency translation on our full year results. We've experienced a solid first half in the worldwide to bookings growth and although we have a tough compare in the third quarter compared with last year's third quarter growth of 14%, we now expect to achieve about 10% full year growth in new business bookings over the $1.4 billion sold in fiscal year 2014. The fundamentals of our business are solid and for total ADP we still expect revenue growth of 7% to 8% despite the current environment surrounding foreign exchange rate. Although the overall forecast remains the same, we do expect changes on a segment level and Employees Services and the PEO. We are adjusting our forecast for Employees Services to reflect expected headwinds of about two percentage points from the impact of foreign currencies and translation and now expect about 5% growth compared to our prior forecast of 6% to 7%. And while once the employment tax program was extended through the end of calendar year 2014, it has not yet been renewed for calendar year 2015 and we therefore expect lower revenue than previously anticipated from these tax credits filed on behalf of our clients. For the PEO, we are increasing our revenue forecast to reflect solid performance during the first half of our fiscal year and we now expect the PEO to deliver 15% to 17% growth compared with our prior forecast of 13% to 15% growth. So the mix is changed but overall we expect to be on track for our full year revenue guidance even with the expected headwinds from foreign currency translation. Our pretax margin forecast for total ADP remains the same; we still expect 75 to 100 basis points of margin improvement from the 18.4% in fiscal year 2014. On a segment levels, we are modifying our margin expansion forecast for the PEO and now expect margin expansion of up to 100 basis points compared with our prior forecast of up to 50 basis points. Our forecast of margin expansion in the Employees Services remains unchanged. We still anticipate about a 100 basis points of margin expansion. We're updating our forecast with effective tax rate to reflect the one time benefit we've received in the second quarter and we now anticipate a tax rate of 34.2% compared with our prior forecast of 34.6%. Although we have changed our forecast of tax rate, we expect to have earnings pressure from the impact of the foreign currency translation in the second half of the fiscal year, so there is no change to our diluted earnings per share forecast. We still expect growth of 12% to 14% compared with a $2.58 in fiscal year 2014. And as a reminder, this forecast of 12% to 14% includes an anticipated $0.02 benefit resulting from share repurchases funded by the $825 million in dividend proceeds ADP received as a result of the spin-off of the CDK. However, the forecast does not contemplate further share buyback beyond the anticipated dilution related to equity comp plans and the dividend proceeds from CDK. There is no change to our previous forecast related to the client funds investment strategy. We could experience some pressure in client funds interest revenue in the second half of the year due to the changing interest rate environment and the impact of foreign currency translation on interest earned outside the US, however, we are maintaining our forecast and still anticipate an increase of $5 million to $15 million over last year from the client funds extended investments strategy. The detail of this forecast is available both in the press release and in the supplemental slides on our website.  In closing, last week I had the opportunity to participate in ADP's annual ReThink Conference in London, this was our largest ever gathering of clients and prospect representing multinational corporations. HR finance and IT executive from some of the largest companies in the world joined us for two days of discussions about the future of HR and ADP's HCM's capability. In the many personal conversations I had with these leaders at ReThink, it is clear that our vision for HCM is resonating giving me confidence that we continue to be on the right path.  With that I'll turn it over to the operator to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sara Gubins of BofA Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Sara Gubins : Thank you, good morning. Great performance in the new business sales this quarter. Could you give us some details on where you saw most of the strength? Carlos Rodriguez : It was actually across the board. Sara Gubins : Okay, great. With the RUN migration now over can you talk about where you are shifting those resources? And also could you give us some client count for Workforce Now versus those still on the legacy platform and when you would expect to be able to shut legacy platforms down? Carlos Rodriguez : Well, Jan has the numbers in terms of -- on Workforce Now. In terms of our priorities, just again I want to reemphasize how proud we are of the organization and small business. It took on us very large task of moving several hundred thousands clients which is benefit of hindsight now seems like the right decision and we actually had our retention improve and our margin and cost structure improve in that business over the last two three years. But that wasn't -- it wasn't obvious that was going to be the outcome at the time. There was a lot of  trepidation about losing clients and competitive issues and so forth and it just -- it turned out be very well executed migration that really enhance our competitiveness, our market position, our market share just really across the board. A great job by that organization and we are right at the end of the show here with only couple of thousands clients. So I just want give, praise to that organization in terms of the job they did because that was serve I think as an example for the rest of the organization as to what can be done and what the outcomes are when it is done in terms of migration because you can just feel simplification and the simplicity entering into that business as a result of having only platform, having to train only one set of implementation, associate, maintaining only one platform, it just got -- it is a real home run so obviously now we turn our sight to the mid market and to the up market. We have a lot of momentum and lot of progress already with Workforce Now in the mid market and really national accounts where the up market is where we are now training our sight to as quickly as possible began moving larger client. So right now the focus for us is doing what we can to use both internal resources and we are actually -- I think we mentioned in the last call actually also using some external resources to help with those migration in the up market to try to accelerate. So I guess the answer to the question is we are trying to move resources that were being focused on the migration to RUN and the small business market over national account. And I think in the mid market it is steady as you go, we are just continuing to plow away and moving as many clients as possible over to our strategic platforms. I think Jan has the numbers. Jan Siegmund : Yes, Sara, So as Carlos mentioned of course RUN is huge success story so now with almost 425,000 clients on that platform is really a wonderful outcome. And we are making similar steady progress on the PCPW migration in major accounts and I think we have formally alluded that we would finish this by the end of fiscal year; we are still on track for that. We migrate in the first half of approximately 3,000 and we have about the same left, so we are really here in the final stages of also finishing that major migration project. Carlos Rodriguez : I think the other thing just to reiterate why we are doing this. I think there are a variety of reasons but clearly two of the most important reasons are as we use the number of legacy platforms we can reinvest those funds in our strategic go forward platforms. So that's exciting to be able to put even more resources into the new stuff. And second of all it is to improve our competitiveness in the market place because this older legacy platform sometimes creates an exposure from client retention standpoint. So I think we've so far, knock on wood, I think proven that we are getting a both of those things and done some from these migration strategy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Togut : Thank you. And good morning. Carlos you highlighted increased competitiveness as you move up legacy platform and just some of the new platforms, could you perhaps share some insights in terms of direct competitive experience let say down market versus paychecks and perhaps in the mid market versus ultimate where you have almost completed the transition to Workforce Now. Carlos Rodriguez : We try not to get into specific one by one competitors, I think overall in the categories that you described we have obviously a lot of data around win loss ratio and we have some data around market share and I think that's why we make the comments that we believe our competitiveness is improving because I think our metrics show that. And again these are incremental improvements but we are still happy with them and they are going in the right direction. I don't know if Jan has any additional color but we measured competitiveness really in terms of winning or losing in the market place. And we believe that our win rate curve improved as a result of not just our investments in new products but also these moves are putting our clients on a newest platform. David Togut : This is the follow up to that you mentioned 15% global booking growth in Employees Services and strength across the board. Can you flush that out a little bit? Is some of the strengths driven by particularly new products? Is this tend to be more kind of down market with RUN? Is it up market with Vantage HCM? Carlos Rodriguez : So I think as we mentioned in prior calls in terms of being consistent about giving the same answer when things are good versus when they are not so good. Sales for us are more variable than obviously our revenue is in other metrics in our business because the nature of the way our new business booking work. So there are lots of things that have an impact. Incentive has an impact and we talked about that in the past. Sometimes our incentives can hurt us and sometimes they can create more difficult compares. The economy clearly has something to do with it. Competitors obviously are a factor as well as the strength of our product and the timing of product releases. So there are just a lot of things that go into the mix. So it's very, very hard with a degree of I think objectivity to give you specific answers to what's driven the strength. But this is our second quarter of double digit sales growth and when I look at the trends over the last -- won't call the trend but we have now couple of decades of data around our quarterly sales results. And this feels like a very good situation for us because as you know last year we ended the year with 7% sales growth after several years of double digit sales growth. And I think we are on track this year obviously based on our revised guidance the double digit gains so it is incredibly pleasing because I think it appears that we've at a minimum broke-in kind of what I'd call the economic cycle issue which is -- we have tended in the past and strong economic cycles to go double digit and then we kind of trail off in terms of sales growth over time and then during recession we end up going negative. And so this time when I look at that chart and I look at that trend, this is -- this was an important year for us, important quarter and important six months in showing that we can continue to grow our sales at double digit, ex any factors in the economy or in this case we have some issues abroad and Europe and few other places. So I wish I can give you an objective answer other than it is a combination of a lot of things. I think our products are getting incrementally better. Our sales force is executing incredibly well. We've refined some of our incentives over the years to I think drive better sales results and we have also changed the mix of our sales headcount to have more components in our inside sales force to drive our sales expense to a better level. So it is just -- again I gave lot of praise to our small business division for the migrations over the RUN and also got given an enormous amount of praise to our sales force in terms of the way they executed this quarter and these six months because last year was not -- it was a tough year. And again just to reiterate it is across the board. I wasn't trying to be short in that end but it is just that that is the fact. Double digit sales growth across really all of ours sales segment, up market, mid market, low end, just really across the board. So I can't unfortunately provide you any more detail on that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Georgios Mihalos of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is open. Georgios Mihalos : Great, thanks, good morning, guys. And congrats on another strong quarter and good momentum. Wanted to start off can you remind us how new sales breakdown throughout the fourth quarter? I don't think there is that much variability, but if you could address that and maybe related to that, January is a big month on a small business side. Maybe just your thoughts as we exit that month how the sales activity was there? Carlos Rodriguez : Funny you should mention that because I asked Sara for that data couple of days ago just to -- we are obviously not going to talk about January because that's the -- it is next quarter's discussion but we do have the January results and I was curious to see how much of the year's quota has been expanded because we do have very strong sales in November. And very strong sales in January due to seasonality. But we also have as you have probably seen in the past, very, very strong June mainly driven because of yearend incentives which we've talked about I think quite a bit. Both the positives and the negative. So the long and short of it is that it actually works out the right about balance so in seven out of 12 months we have expanded about 7/12th of our quote and I think in six months so there is probably a little bit less but it is really not -- it is not meaningful in terms of difference in terms of you being able to think through or me being able to think through, the odds of asking able to hit our forecast given what where we are in the year. We feel pretty good about hitting our forecast. Georgios Mihalos : It definitely sounds that way. And then just follow up to that the pays per control outlook 2% to 3%; you have been 3% now over the first half of the year. Is that just conservatism keeping the low end of the range here? What seem here that you are going to be able to do better than that? Jan Siegmund : Yes. Maybe I'll answer that. Really we're for the first half of the year, and the number itself is not that impactful for our total results. So it is really depended of --if the economy going to change significant course we had, great employment growth of the country for now a number of years so we didn't feel we needed to updated it but it should be right around somewhere. Carlos Rodriguez : And as a reminder 1% change in pays per control is $8 million in annual revenue. So if that were to change by half of a percent for the rest of the year, it would be $2 million impact for revenue so I think as Jan said really not that impactful but more importantly we've seen this movie before where we are incredibly please that it is holding up at that level and it has been that way for a few years. But it will at some point come down to 2.5 or 2 or somewhere in that range but we hope it continues indefinitely but we are not planning on that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Smittipon Srethapramote from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Smittipon Srethapramote : Now that the January 1st deadline is passed can you just talk a little bit more about the new ACA product how did in the quarter and how it is done since beginning of the year? Carlos Rodriguez : We don't have any specific numbers that we can share but we are very, very pleased. Jan may want to add his own color. We had a business review with the folks running that business actually quite recently and the number of units that we've sold and the new business bookings, we have generated new business bookings from this product, and we have actually started a handful of clients, and we have a very large backlog, and we're very excited about it. Jan Siegmund : I think may be a few the ACA product has a new direction serves, of course, as an example of ADP's strength of combining technology with compliance. And so we fun lighted [ph] of course it is one of the largest problem solve clients' space. This ACA product targeted for large clients of market product so the number of units that we will be selling and trying to achieve in the realm of a national account type product. And I think what yielded our positive outlook on the product is really started in earnest in the last quarter and second quarter to sell this product, and the pace of how the pipeline has built and our ability to close a number of much the same in that space caused basically optimism. I don't think it will augment clearly and will support the growth rate of new business bookings, but it would be also wrong to anticipate that this would have tonnage point difference in our sales growth rate going forward. But it is going to be an important product that rounds out our value proposition and combination with our core offerings is very powerful, but that's more the purpose of why we talk along bit more in detail about the ACA products. Carlos Rodriguez : Thanks, Jan. Maybe my enthusiasm got ahead of me because our blessing and our curses that we have nearly $1.6 billion in new bookings, and $11 billion in revenue. So I think Jan is very correct that my enthusiasm wasn't intended to imply that this is going to add two to three points of either sales growth or a point of revenue growth. You can just do the math in terms of what that would imply. We hope that over the next two to three years it could be meaningful and significant, but clearly for this year it is not going to -- it's helping and rounding things out, but I should have probably been more careful in the choice of my words. Smittipon Srethapramote : Thanks for the clarification. And maybe just a follow-up on the same topic. As the PEO business continues to do very well, can you talk about what you are seeing in terms of customer demand for your ASO type products? Carlos Rodriguez : Sure. First of all, let me just say that I was actually in Atlanta, had a great visit to Atlanta in December and visited with a couple of the business units that operate mainly out of our Atlanta office, including the PEO, and folks who run the ASO. And that business just in general is executing incredibly well, both PEO and the ASO. So really all of our -- all of our BPO offerings, mid market, up market, and the ones that you're referring to, PEO and ASO, are all I think really resonating in the marketplace, probably driven in part by this increasing complexity around compliance. So some of it is ACA driven in terms of people just looking for alternative, that's creating more meetings and more discussions which leads to more opportunities, and then closing more business. Some of it may be what appears to be a growing need for focusing on talent as the unemployment rate begins to dip here and people start to focus more on attracting and retaining and managing their workforce well. So I think there are probably a number of reasons in terms of creating some tailwind. But the very -- a great discussion, and just business is really executing very, very well, both the ASO and the PEO, just across the board, great execution on the sales results but also in terms of the implementation of our business and the underlying metrics of the business in terms of pays per control there. They're all just -- they're all in very good shape. So great discussion that went Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Gary Bisbee : Hi, guys, good morning. Let me just first follow up on that last point. Is there -- PEO continues to be incredibly strong. Is there any way to know how long the momentum continues at this level? And I guess what I'm particularly interested in, are you seeing any -- now that a lot of businesses are in compliance with ACA, are you seeing any decline or is there any sense that maybe there was some pulled forward demand to get into compliance, or are those drivers of more people being interested and considering their options remaining strong in calendar 2015? Carlos Rodriguez : And I think our plan is to have the momentum continue forever. That would be the way we are planning things because in part the market share of the PEO industry in general in relation to the total employment for small and midsized businesses is relatively low. This is a theme that I think has been true for a couple of decades. I think the backdrop in terms of the economy and the regulatory environment has some impact on whether clients are open to discussion or not. But the fact of the matter is you want to be in businesses preferably with lower penetration versus the higher penetration. I think the PEO is that kind of business where only a couple percentage points at most of employees -- the available market are actually using a PEO. So we believe that theoretically the opportunity is very large and then it becomes a question of execution. And as I mentioned, other factors that may or may not be tailwinds, like the regulatory environment which we think happens to be very favorable right now. We haven't seen any signs yet that everyone is all of a sudden in compliance, and that there's no more interest in the PEO because you saw the quarter results, and I think our forecast for sales results for the rest of the year for that business would not indicate any feeling or belief that interest is drying up. So I think that there is a need to be in compliance, but if you remember, ACA is mostly affecting over -- and clients with over 50 employees. What are causing some of the interest in PEO is the entire backdrop around ACA and the regulatory environment which is people scrambling to have competitive benefit plans that you can compete also with some of these exchanges. So it's not specifically clients that need it on a particular date to be in compliance. I think this is something that will continue for many years to come where small companies and midsize companies are going to be looking for alternatives to healthcare plans that they may have in the past, add on an individual plan basis, whether that be they look at our solutions through the PEO, or they look at exchanges. I think people are just looking for alternatives to be able to control healthcare cost to be competitive in their own business. Gary Bisbee : Great. And then the follow-up, it seems like you're starting to get more, whether it's products or other from the innovation lab you set up a year or two ago, and I guess, can you give us a high-level sense, do you think those investments are going to lead to noticeable incremental revenue in the next few years, or is it more on the margin? And as part of that maybe could you just give us an example of what kind of thing the ADP marketplace offering might be able to lead to? What would be like a tangible example of a potential product there? Thank you. Carlos Rodriguez : Just in terms of -- I'll let -- actually Jan can be talk about the examples in the ADP marketplace because he is equally excited about that. But in terms of your question about innovation driven products and growth coming from that, again, back to unfortunately you have to go back to the comment in terms of just keeping us all on the same page because of our size and our new business bookings, so our new business bookings per year are larger than most of our competitors combined. So we have a large path. I think the innovation lab and some of our focus on product is intended to as to use Jan's words to round out and ensure and hopefully improve a little bit on our growth rate in sales and revenue. So clearly we would be less than ambitious if we told you that we're just trying to stay in place. But we're clearly trying to accelerate our growth. Again the expectations that we create it is very important for us to be transparent, and I think for us to move our revenue growth up a couple percentage points is very difficult and requires a big increase in new business bookings and very, very good client retention. So having said all that, that's our plan, is to try to continue to drive and improve revenue growth through better net new business which is the difference between start or new business bookings and or loss. And our innovation investments are a large part of that. As we said multiple times. All of the products that we've discussed that have come out thus far, that are new out of either innovation lab or some of our other processes that we have internally in terms of new product launches are relatively small in comparison to the size of our new business bookings in total and to ADP overall. So it is very, very hard to say today that it is going to add x amount of incremental sales for revenue growth but that's our plan over multiple years is to really have a pipeline of organically built and organically developed products that are easier to use and provide better value to our clients and are better integrated to really drive more unit sales but also more sales of our additional modules around benefits, talent management, and other areas around HCM in addition to our traditional payroll. So I don't know, Jan, if you want to talk about the marketplace. Jan Siegmund : Absolutely. So of course the marketplace there is basically an offering that allows a third party software developer as well as clients to easily integrate with our core product offering. With ADP focusing on human capital management we realize that we're living in an integrated world, and I think we have the utmost flexibility for our clients to integrate our solutions into their overall businesses which is very important. So we expect for example, vertical-specific applications to be available maybe the restaurant industry or maybe the retail industry that would leverage employment data for additional value adds or components to it. But it could be also product like advanced management that we don't offer and have a close relationship to our core payroll offering that will benefit from tight integration into our core product set. I think the message we want to send primarily with this call is, our push for innovation and to be at the leading front of having flexible and easy to integrate technology that makes the value to our clients the highest is our intent. And that may be a different notion compared to the ADP that you would have known three, four, five years ago where we were a little bit more proprietary and harder to integrate maybe and today we really believe and through that integrated network of applications. So that's what the marketplace is really about. And it is kind of an outcome of our investments into innovation, yielding our ability to have these APIs, really accessing a whole bunch of our applications just through one API so I think a very good step forward for us illustrating I think the progress we're making on the back of our technology. Carlos Rodriguez : I think, in a nutshell, it's really asked for, and we already have an app there, and we intend to drive more partnerships. And we hope that it will not only make things better for our clients because of their ability to integrate, but we do have revenue share agreements like anyone else would have in their types of app scores, so the key question is what's going to be the degree of success? Because this literally brand new. So we'll obviously keep you informed because this could end up being a large opportunity, or it may not, from a revenue and sales standpoint. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from SK Prasad Borra of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. SK Prasad Borra : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First, on the PEO segment, can you provide any color on the mix of your customer base and what traction are you seeing more at the mid to low end? And what positive impact does it have on operating margin in the midterm? Carlos Rodriguez : In the PEO, the mix of business, our PEO tends to be more white and gray collar than I think the average of the US economy and some other PEOs. So that's number one. If our average client size I believe are around 40, if I'm not mistaken. Yes, I'm getting the confirmation it is around 40. So that tends to be probably slightly larger than maybe some other PEOs. But we still have a lot of small business clients. So it is obviously they're averages. We have large clients that improve the average but it's still largely an under 50 sweet spot business if you will. In terms of industries, tend to stay away from -- it doesn't mean we don't have any, we tend to stay away from very high-risk things like roofers and construction and so forth. In terms of the impact on the margins on the overall business, we segment report so it's mathematically it's a drag on our earnings when PEO is growing as robustly as it is. Having said that, the fact of the matter is, that on an earnings -- pure earnings growth standpoint, it is an incredibly accretive and profitable and attractive business on any measure, whether it's on an MPV basis, the business requires no investment per se. Whatever investment we make, most of them run through the P&L so there's no kind of outside capital investments that would drive kind of return other than what you are seeing which is a very, very high return business despite the fact that because of its profile it just happens to have a lower margin because of all the past. So we will grow the PEO as fast as we can, because it will add to EPS growth and shareholder value, and we will explain and manage through the margin compression if necessary. SK Prasad Borra : I'm sorry, I also meant that just from a customer profile point of view as it changes over the next few years based on your investments and based on your sales and marketing push, what kind of a positive or negative impact does it have as your customer profile in the PEO segment changes? And probably just one other question is, more from a product portfolio perspective. Are there any obvious areas in your product portfolio where you want extra investment both organically and through M&A? Carlos Rodriguez : Let me just clarify, you're expecting what kind of change in our client profile on the PEO? SK Prasad Borra : I was saying that if your customer profile size probably decreases from base say 40 numbers to probably 20 or whatever that is, do you have more profitability as the size of your customer profile decreases? Carlos Rodriguez : It's been very consistent for a long, long time, and I don't anticipate that it is going to change dramatically. When we had our business review in Atlanta, the profitability of our large clients versus our small clients, there's some differences, but it wasn't meaningful. So and again, we have 350,000 worksite employees now. To move that number from 40 to 20 is almost impossible in any kind of reasonable period of time. On your question about what things do we want to -- I think your question was what we want to make more investments in. SK Prasad Borra : From a product portfolio standpoint Carlos Rodriguez : From a product portfolio standpoint, I think you are going to see us continuing to make the same kinds of investments that you have seen us do over the last two or three years which are really focused on creating a better integrated, easier to use experience for our clients. And so the work that we're doing in the up market and the work that you have seen us do in Workforce Now are all around all of that. So we have -- we believe we have already a very broad set of solutions in HCM all the way from recruitment to retirement. So what we're really trying to do is enhance the usability of our products and the integration of our products, and then obviously we mentioned in our talking points that we believe that data analytics is a huge source of potential competitive advantage and insight that we could provide for our clients, because now that we're all in on HCM what we really want to do is be known for helping our clients better manage their workforce. And that means going beyond just data processing and being efficient to really providing expertise and insight and data we have I think allows us to do that but that requires some investment as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Foresi from Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is open. Joseph Foresi : Hi. I wonder on the new bookings growth can you give us some idea what of that is attributable to either change incentives versus the macro versus the new product you have in place. I'm just trying to get a sense of sort of how you can break that down. And I have one follow-up. Carlos Rodriguez : I may have confused the issue by bringing even the topic of incentive. There have been no changes in incentives. I just always mention that because it seems to rear its head sometimes in our fourth quarter, either positive or negative. And then it rears its head again in the first quarter because we have a lot of incentives that drive year end results. This is true in almost every company that has a sales force where you have accelerators or incentives towards the end of the year. So I think it happens a lot in software companies. And so we're no different. So this specific quarter, no changes in incentives, so there's really nothing to report there. I should have probably not brought it up. In terms of how much of it was new product versus sales force execution, I think the people from R&D would say that it was 100% product, and sales would say that it's 100% execution. So the truth is probably somewhere in between. Joseph Foresi : Okay and then just -- Jan Siegmund : Let me add, it would be, as you know, the sales model drives from adding heads to our sales force and overall drives productivity of our sales force with enhanced productivity of our product and better execution and it would be balanced growth profile add as well. [Technical Difficulty] Carlos Rodriguez : And that productivity has really been phenomenal for multiple years now. And I'm sure that products are helping but clearly it's also really great execution and great leadership in that organization. They have proven once again this quarter that we have the best direct sales force in the world. Joseph Foresi : Got it. And then just on any color on win rate changes, if you want to be, either the company level and/ or within the individual mid cap, large cap spaces that you are going after? Carlos Rodriguez : We watch those numbers very carefully, and we're also very, very careful about how we talk about. I would just tell you the best way to describe it are a generalization. I think Jan can add, but I would say that we are very, very pleased with the focus that our business leaders have in improving our win rate, our win/loss rate, not just at the retention level in terms of losing clients with but upfront in the sales process. And so I think we have leaders who understand the importance of winning in the marketplace and of increasing market share and metrics we have are very encouraging. Joseph Foresi : Thank you. Jan Siegmund : As we have discussed over time, at the highest level improving sales, improving retention generally just has to be indicator about this business relative to prior periods, and that's really virtually the only number that you can draw from at the high level. At the detailed level, I think we shared with you that our losses are comprised not of a single poor lost competitor -- lost that was to a single competitor but to a whole range of 20, 30, 40 competitors that we all need to monitor. So I think it would be probably misleading to point out single ones, because -- and it's not a single competitor is immaterial, but the aggregate of the 30, 40 competitors that we monitor are very important to us. So that's why I think it's probably most fair to go with the directional comments that Carlos gave and round it out with the overall competitive of accelerating sales and together to form an overall picture. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank AG. Your line is open. Ashish Chhabra : Hi, this is Ashish Chhabra calling in on behalf of Bryan Keane. Thanks for taking our question. Quickly on the PEO, a pretty solid growth there. And if you look at the average worksite employee paid growth over the last four quarters those have been trending in the mid-teens or even higher. And those have been significantly higher than what the normal growth has been over the last few years. So just looking forward, does this accelerated growth create tougher comps going forward? And also what would be the normalized growth in the worksite employees as we look forward on a more normalized basis? Thanks. Carlos Rodriguez : I think it's a very good question, and again we would hope that the momentum continues indefinitely, but I would tell you that when you look at our operating plans and our forecasts, the compares do get more difficult. That business happens to have a great deal of lumpiness on January 1st because of the way taxes operate in the PEO environment. Ironically, it was a change in the law as part of the yearend Congressional law that were passed that are going to make that a little bit easier going forward and PEOs are not going to have to restart taxes. So that should smooth out the lumpiness of that business somewhat, and not have such a huge peak in January. But the reason I bring that up is because of that peak in January, the growth rate of that business, even though they tend to have another peak in June because of our fiscal yearend and the incentives that we always talk about in sales there, January has been a particularly important number for us in the PEO business because the difference between the new business bookings and the losses that take place in that December to January timeframe tend to drive the year-over-year growth rate on worksite employees for the next 12 months on a calendar year basis. And because of just the size of the business, which is 350,000 worksite employees, I think anyone can do the math and figure out how many new worksite employees we need to sell. We know what our retention rate or you can probably guess close to what our retention rate is, and you can figure out that, that the need to sell that many clients larger than probably all but two or three other competitors in the space. So it is - the compares are getting difficult to say the least. And we are entering the law of large numbers. So if it were me, I would probably be expecting moderation in the growth rate. It doesn't mean that it is going to happen next quarter or this fiscal year, but I think it is a good idea to moderate expected growth rate of that business. We've been incredibly pleased with it for the last two or three years, but I think we're just trying to be realistic here in terms of expectations. Ashish Chhabra : Carlos thanks for that color. And a quick follow-up again on the PEO side. When I look at revenue for average worksite employee that has been trending more in the 3$ range in the first half of the year. Can you just talk about what are the drivers there? Is it more higher fees, more pass through? And as you look forward, how should we think about that particular metric? Thanks. Carlos Rodriguez : Actually all of the above. So its additional fees as in fees that drive our kind of bottom line we call processing revenue and hence our profitability plus also the pass. So whenever you have inflation in either workers' compensation or in benefits cost, that will also drive growth obviously in revenue and also growth in revenue per worksite employee in that business. So we give you the worksite employee number, and we provide in the Q and in the 10-K pass through, and you can actually do the math and figure out how much of the growth is coming, as we're trying to be transparent, how much of the growth is coming from pass through, and that allows you to back into how much of the growth is coming from our fees, if you will, and again, back to my visit to Atlanta, I think they're both growing at reasonable rates. So there isn't -- and again, we would tell if you our fees were dropping and it were all because of pass through. The reason we haven't told you that is because it's not true and there's nothing to report. It's been consistent for many years now that the PEO has been growing its own internal fee income per worksite employee at a -- call it 2% to 3% rate and than the pass has been growing at varying rates, depending on what's happening with healthcare inflation. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies LLC. Your line is open. Ryan Cary : Hi, guys, this is Ryan Cary calling in for Jason. I just wanted to dig deeper into FX. I was hoping you could give us a little more color on your assumption for the remainder of the year. So when we are looking at the 1% full year headwinds, does that assume the dollar trading at the current levels? Carlos Rodriguez : Yes. That is the assumptions. Ryan Cary : Okay, great, thanks so much. And then now that the dealer service of business spun out, and really a pure play HCM company, is it plausible you might look to M&A a bit to extend your reach further into the market and kind of looking beyond that when looking at the market where do you see the most M&A opportunities? Is it more in the legacy core payroll processing side of the business or is it more along the PEO/BPO side? Carlos Rodriguez : We actually -- we do still do acquisitions in kind of our core payroll business as you have just described. They tend to be kind of tuck-in and they're just migrations. As you can tell from our theme, we're trying not to maintain and add additional platforms in our business for the time being. But we do those. Again because of our size, we don't talk about those a lot, but we are kind of actively using our capital to when we can grow market share as long as there's a good MVP associated with the acquisition. We tend to call those client based acquisitions where we are buying the clients and moving them on to our platform rather than buying the entire entity or the company. Outside of that space in terms of just the broad HCM market, again we think we have a broad solution from recruitment to retirement, but we absolutely understand and acknowledge that there are people that are stronger than we are in some parts of HCM, and it may be appropriate at some point and in some cases to enhance our capabilities through M&A activity or through acquisitions. So we are -- it may not feel like it or look like it to many people, but we do want to use our capital, but we want to use it wisely. And so it has to make sense in terms of the technology that we're getting, and it can't just be revenue and a new platform. That's not our strategy, and so there has to be on our terms and it has to fit into our strategic direction. But we believe that there are opportunities out there that would enhance our competitiveness and our ability to grow and add new business bookings, but we're being incredibly disciplined, and as you know, the valuation backdrop is not favorable in the HCM market right now. And I think the other big opportunity for us is geographic. You saw that we made an acquisition in Latin America last year. And this is a place where, again, back to the issues of market share, we talk about the PEO having very low penetration in general in our PEO specifically, geography is another place where you look at outside the US, ADP has really only scratched the surface of opportunities in many of the geographic opportunities that we serve. Not just multinationals but also in countries. So this is another place where it would be a safe assumption to plan on us using our capital to kind of expand our reach globally. It may be counterintuitive because today it feels like because of what's happened with FX, everyone is running from international but generally speaking that's exactly the time to look at something is when everyone else is running away. So we're, I think continuing to look at opportunities outside the US and trying to find ways of enhancing our competitive strength and our growth outside the US. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeff Silber : Thanks so much. I think we've seen an earnings season with a number of other companies is the impact of declining oil prices on their business. And I just was wonder if you have seen any of that either in a positive or negative way. On the negative side I would think would be if you have a lot of energy exposure, if you've seen some reduction in payroll from some of those customers. Thanks. Carlos Rodriguez : I think it's a good question. Just because of again of our size and our geographic spread and our industry spread, the answer would be no. Certainly not something that we've been able to identify. So we will look at it again to make sure that my answer is correct, but we really don't have that kind of concentration in our business. We're so big and so broad, both in the US and also globally, that the real impact is the FX impact which may or may not be connected to what's going on with oil, but it's certainly connected to what's happening in Europe and Japan and other parts of the world. And luckily for us, only 18%, in this case luckily for us, because it is something we've been trying to address, and I just mentioned in my previous comments, we're trying to become bigger internationally, but the fact is that today our revenues outside the US are only 18%. And as you know, some companies that are peers are in the S&P 500 have close to 50% of their operating earnings and their revenues outside the US. So we have relatively less exposure. And that happens to work out well right now. Our operating income I believe is only 15% exposed outside the US, and both the 18% and the 15% include Latin America, Brazil, and include some business in Asia. So our European exposure is even less than 18%. So again, it's a drag on our revenues and our operating income, but our relative basis, it's a smaller impact for us than it is for some of our other large cap brethren. Ryan Cary : Great. And just a follow-up to that. Can you just remind us where your international exposure is the largest? Carlos Rodriguez : It is in Europe. Ryan Cary : In Europe. And how about Canada? Carlos Rodriguez : I am sorry - - Jan Siegmund : Canada would be number two. Carlos Rodriguez : Canada would be number two. Ryan Cary : Yes, right, thank you so much. Carlos Rodriguez : And Canada is -- it's actually a relevant good question because Canada is a relatively large business calls it between $300 million and $400 million, and it's quite profitable. So it's like a small version of the US, a very good business. I have been in Canada for decades and decades and the reason I mention that is clearly because of the profitability of that business and we have a very good float income business in Canada as well. The impact of the Canadian dollar move has a decent impact on our overall revenue growth in Canada and also our operating income growth in Canada when it gets translated to US dollars. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim MacDonald of First Analysis Securities Corporation. Your line is open. Jim MacDonald : Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just on the PEO, one more little thing. Anything of note during the critical year-end selling season? Carlos Rodriguez : The only thing of note is it did a spectacular job. Jim MacDonald : Okay. And you talked a lot about integrated solutions, and I suspect we will hear a lot about that at the Analyst Day, but how would you sort of view -- grade yourself in integrated solutions, and what areas are you looking to improve there? Carlos Rodriguez : I don't think I'm going to take that bait. So I think it varies. I think our strategic platforms are actually quite well integrated and quite broad and have rich feature functionality. So we still have pockets. We haven't been able to migrate clients where competitors would point out lack of integration. And I think that's just lack of ability or termination to move those clients to our strategic platform. Because once we have those clients on our strategic platform, I think these issues of integration tend to fade into the background. So I think it's a legitimate criticism of us, but it's old news, and it's historical, and it won't be true in the near future. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citigroup. Your line is open. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Thank you. Hey, guys. This may seem like a odd question but over the last few years, as you guys have progressively simplified the overall business, the talk that sort of comes up is what are the synergies, and are there synergies that you can point to why the Employer Services and PEO business should be under one roof, or can you take advantage of the excellent performance in PEO and the valuations in pure play PEO and shared that business and become really pure play ES? Carlos Rodriguez : Frankly, the two businesses because of co-employment, because of pass through and a number of other issues, it's a separate segment. But the businesses have a lot of share a lot of things in common, including the sales forces work very, very close together. So our small business and midsize business sales forces of which you know we have thousands of people on the street, provide leads to our PEO sales force, which has its own sales force, but without their brothers and sisters in the rest of ADP, I don't believe that our PEO would have the kind of success that it has today. So the biggest synergy we believe that we have in distribution and in sales, and we believe it is large, and a very big move for our business has been historically and I think it will be going forward. I think there are other advantages. We have capital so when we run into issues around historically in the marketplace around workers' compensation, we've been able to do things that others eventually were able to do but we had more flexibility in terms of being able to use our capital and our strong credit rating. And so I think there are other advantages to having the PEO be part of ADP, but the most important one is the sales synergy. So I would say that I can't envision that business being a separate business. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Okay. Understood. I guess another question I have is and you mentioned this in the past, with regards to the platform -- the ongoing platform consolidation, as we think of the forward margin impact of that, and how much will you allow to flow through to the bottom line, versus investing in other things. Could you help clarify? I'm assuming it is primarily not so much a fiscal 2015, but more like a fiscal 2016, 2017 impact, but just trying to quantify if we are going to see potentially outsized margin improvement years. Carlos Rodriguez : Right. I think it depends on the competition. If we were able -- ever able to get into a situation where there were no competitors left, then we would not reinvest anything in the business. But we're trying to build, I think Jan and myself and the entire management team I think are keenly aware that today we have the opposite situation where we have a highly competitive environment and a lot of competitors, some of which have done a very nice job. And so our plan for the short term and medium term, and we'll go into a little bit more detail at the Investor Day, is to invest as much as we can in creating long-term value for this company. But we are a 65 year old company. We intend to be around for another 65 years. And the only way to do that is to be constantly reinventing yourself and reinvesting in the business. And so our strategies around migrations are in part to make sure that our stakeholders and our shareholders also get some return in the form of improved margin. But the main reason why we're doing the things we do is to create better competitiveness and to create long-term value for the company, so that we make sure this enterprise endures and continues to grow at a very good rate for a long time, not just for a year or two. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Got it, understood. You guys sure don't behave like 65 years old but yes it is a good thing. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon of Robert W. Baird & Co. Your line is open. Mark Marcon : Good morning. Carlos so I was really encouraged by your comments with regards to international and investing there. Nice to see somebody take advantage of the strong dollar. Can you talk a little bit more about the opportunities that you see over there and what you are hearing Jan in London, in terms of the receptivity to ADP and how it is positioned vis-\u00e0-vis some of the competitive alternatives? Carlos Rodriguez : Yes. I think, Mark, thank you for the question. When we talk about ADP's global footprint just to level set, we have a physical presence of in country solutions in about 40 countries and we offer within a 100 countries now solution and some of these countries we serve through partners and our Latin American acquisition that we did little bit more than a year ago, was one of those partners that we worked with and they were great partners since the integration and ownership of certain technology assets allows us to improve the services to offer client a more integrated as we talk solutions, so when we evaluate where to expand and what country, it is really driven by the demand of our multinational clients and the ability to have partners that have good technology solutions and services that would help us further differentiate that solution. And today already a market leading solutions in the vast majority of the outsource global market is really captured by ADP. So we are very, very good on the multinational side. And we would continue to keep that said advantage that we have by investments. So I think it is really driven by where is the lot of demand and is in that country a good competitor or a good partner that we think is viable to be acquired and I think that will drive the expansion to moderate that expectations these tend to be now smaller countries or faster growing countries so the acquisitions are maybe a bit smaller in nature and more technology oriented but they will certainly then help us to just mend our leading position over time. Mark Marcon : I appreciate that color. Carlos on the PEO side, can you talk a little bit about what your -- the declines that you are gaining, are they existing PEO clients and you are taking them from competitors or are they brand new to the PEO and it is a complete conversion? And which regions of the country are you seeing that stem from? In other words, is it the well penetrated markets like Florida and Texas or do you see a rapid expansion across the country? Carlos Rodriguez : So again back to the visit n Atlanta, we've got some information on some of those questions and I think that we've actually consistently for many, many years had a mix of our clients that we get from other PEOs and again this very similar to the ADP business model and a fair amount that comes from we call in house so they are doing it themselves, they have an insurance broker for insurance and they do payroll with ADP or with someone else. And so I don't think there is really any meaningful change to report there. Clearly, there are no more competitors that have higher profile now in the PEO space and maybe two or three years ago but again this is a business where we clearly run into competition but because of penetration rates and market share for both us and our competitors, there are still a lot of open territory out there in terms of not on only geographically but I mean in terms of clients to sell that are not necessarily with a competitor. Having said that, we clearly take our fair share from competitors and some of them take their fair share from us. But there is really nothing meaningful to report there. And some of the geographic distribution of our success again because of the size of the business, we clearly have variability in terms of different regions in different parts of the country which are driven in some case by execution issues and other cases by past through costs like healthcare so a variety of reasons that might cause shift in one region versus other. But because of sheer size there really isn't anyone region who is performing very poorly because it would be impossible for us to generate the kind of results that we are delivering now if we had any one specific geographic region not performing. So they are really performing well in a fairly balanced way. There is really nothing significant to report there either. Mark Marcon : So from a longer-term perspective, do you believe that with the new legislative change that the penetration rate can become more even across the country relative to the way it is now? Carlos Rodriguez : The changes in the law really affect the way taxes start at the federal level and so I don't think they really causes the change in geographic -- well it could be because higher wage client in California and New York for example, the tax restart issues was more pronounced in higher wage areas and higher wage state. So it might be some small impact from -- positive impact from the fact that the taxes won't have to restart again. But I think the biggest impact that we expect to see is more evenly distributed sales throughout the year. And clients not having to wait till January 1st start because of this negative impact from the tax restart. So that actually the most meaningful -- the most meaningful issue. And I think that helps a lot in terms of the execution of that business and it might actually help a little bit in terms of incremental sales because it is not always easy to talk to client in June and then convince them to sign but start in on January 1st. So the fact that the client can now sign up and start in June without any negative impacts on the tax restarts should be an enhancement to our competitiveness and to industry's competitiveness. Mark Marcon : Great. And if I could squeeze one more in, just on the mid market space, what percentage I missed it, what percentage of your client base has been switched over to work place now? Jan Siegmund : Workforce Now? Mark Marcon : Workforce Now Jan Siegmund : So we have now about 1,000, TCW clients meaning out of in the mid market Mark Marcon : Out of how many? Jan Siegmund : We have about almost 55,000 clients on Workforce Now. So a very small number so we are kind of really on task to also finish as planned in fiscal year -- end of fiscal year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis of Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Your line is open. Lisa Ellis : Good morning, guys. Question on the PEO. I think when we've discussed it before you've indicated that small sized M&A in the PEO market like rolling up these 700-800 odd small PEOs out there is tricky because of the insurance, underlying insurance risk in those companies. Given the secular growth, accelerated secular growth we are seeing in that market, have you kind of revisited that or is that still kind of off the table in terms of accelerating the growth in the PEO? Carlos Rodriguez : Well, I think the -- that the best way to answer that is that I think that the PEO general depending on how much risk you take and how -- I don't think the secular growth or tailwinds really impact the -- I guess our view of the world that way. In the sense that now insurance cycle tend to take place over long period of time. They don't take place in one quarter or one year. And whenever you take risks whether it is on healthcare or workers' compensation, the balance sheet reserve that you have are very, very important. Secondly, what you have been taking in terms of P&L expense to drive those reserves is incredibly important too because it is either accurately reflects or doesn't accurately reflect true profitability of those worksite employees for those client. So I guess that's go on and on but no it doesn't change our view that these businesses have underlying insurance risks and as long as PEO is taking risks, you have to then analyze it and look at it as an insurance risk rather than as a recurring revenue processing business which is the rest of our businesses are. So we treat the PEO as one of those ADP business and transfer the risk to either the carrier through healthcare or in case of workers' compensation to captive which is run by our corporate group at an arm's length and hence we believe that we run ours by isolating or limiting the insurance exposure and I think most of our competitors take a lot more risk than we do. Whether they are small or large and that's not of interest to us. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from Tien tsin Huang of JP Morgan Chase & Co. Your line is open. Tien tsin Huang : Thank you. I'll trying to be quick. Just following up on that, on all these PEO questions, just to clarify was the raise in the outlook driven by what we are seeing in January or something else? Just trying to get some understanding around the change there. Carlos Rodriguez : No. It was really based on the prior six months. Tien tsin Huang : Okay. And then have you -- Carlos Rodriguez : Is that answer on the PEO. Tien tsin Huang : I guess I'll ask one more just on the sales headcount growth on PEO. Have you disclosed what that it is? Have you elevated that number in the last 12 months? Carlos Rodriguez : No. We don't really disclose sales headcount by business unit. But you can assume that it is growing at the same in line with kind of the overall sales headcount growth of plus or minus little bit but not as -- as Jan said we are trying to grow our sales headcounts call it between 2% and 4% and then try to achieve the rest of our sales results through productivity improvements. Tien tsin Huang : And then just quickly on the international pays per control. Did you -- can you give that by three regions, big regions and that's all I have. Thanks a lot, guys. Jan Siegmund : We disclosed the European thing and as I mentioned it was flat for the quarter and we have I guess 10 or 20 basis points decline in each of the quarters before so it really has flattened out in Europe, so a very casual utilization. Carlos Rodriguez : I think when we talked about the European performance and almost that backdrop is still sluggish as we would describe it but overall the performance actually of our national was quite good. Operator : This concludes our Q&A session for today. I am please to hand the program back over to Carlos Rodriguez for any closing remarks. Carlos Rodriguez : So thank you all joining the call today. You probably could tell that we are very pleased with the fundamental performance of the business here in the first six months. Very, very happy with the record client retention and the very, very strong new business bookings growth. And I think both of those things reflect that we are winning our fair share in the market. And despite the economic headwinds from the foreign currency translation and some still ongoing pressure from interest rate, still on track to deliver our full year revenue and earnings guidance which is very satisfying for us. Hope to see you at our Investor Day on March the 3rd, New York City. And thank you again for joining us and have a nice day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

With that, I will turn the call over to Carlos. Carlos A. Rodriguez: Thank you, Sara, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported solid results for our third quarter of fiscal 2015, which included revenue growth of 7% despite increased pressure from foreign currency translation. Worldwide new business bookings grew 6% in the quarter compared with a third strong quarter last year. I'm pleased that, fiscal year-to-date, our new business bookings growth is a solid 11%, putting us squarely on track to meet our full year forecast of about 10% growth. Our results are directly attributable to the continued focus and dedication of ADP teams across the world that are driving our HCM strategy. Recently, we had the opportunity to detail this strategy during our Investor Day, which was held on March 3. If you did not have a chance to attend or listen live to the webcast, a recording of the event continues to be available on our website. During our Investor Day, we outlined our strategy, which consists of 3 pillars : first, to continue to innovate from our core platforms to grow a full suite of cloud-based HCM solutions that work together seamlessly; second, continue to scale our industry-leading outsourcing solutions; and third, to expand into global markets that can benefit from our HCM offering and grow globally with our clients. We see evidence of success in executing on all 3 pillars, which contributed to our performance in the quarter. Our SaaS platforms continue to meet expectations, and fiscal year-to-date, our client revenue retention remains at record levels. We continue to expand the capabilities of these platforms to meet the demands of clients and to respond to their need to comply with an increasingly complex regulatory environment. One example of this is ADP Health Compliance, which helps clients manage the complexities of compliance with the Affordable Care Act. This product continues to receive significant interest from our upmarket clients and has recently been introduced to our mid-market clients. Another opportunity for our clients and ADP is big data. Big data represents an opportunity for clients to make better HR decisions. We pay 1 in 6 private sector workers in the U.S. That's the biggest data set of its kind in HCM and affords us a unique opportunity to deliver insights that enable better HR decisions. For years, we've been bringing data-driven insights to the market through the ADP Research Institute, and we will soon be announcing new products which leverage our unique data to deliver insight across HR, wages, time, benefits and talent depending on the client's HCM platform. We continue to be excited with the performance of RUN, our strategic platform targeted to small businesses, which continues to perform well. We now have all of our small-market clients using RUN, an important milestone for our business as we were able to sunset the legacy platform, EasyPay, during the quarter. This is a big achievement, not only because we completed the migrations and can sunset the platform, but also because the execution exceeded our expectations on several other fronts. Notably, we exceeded expectations in client retention during the transition. I believe the high level of retention we experienced is a testament to our product and our clients' confidence in ADP. In addition, throughout the migration, we benefited from greater adoption of HCM modules -- greater adoption of HCM modules than anticipated. While this has not driven a significant amount of revenue for ADP, it is certainly a positive outcome. And while we do not -- while we do anticipate some level of cost savings associated with this platform shutdown, we plan to reinvest the savings to support further migration efforts of legacy systems to our cloud-based platforms. Again, I could not be more proud of our associates for successfully completing these small-market migrations, and this success reinforces our confidence as we push forward on this multiyear migration journey. On the global front, we've continued to grow our capabilities outside North America and have now expanded our offerings of HCM solutions to 104 countries. For clients in these countries, we continue to expand our service capabilities to ensure we are delivering consistent, scalable and valuable services. In February, we announced the opening of a new Center of Excellence in Bucharest, Romania. This is a terrific team that will use standardized and automated systems to help our systems, our clients optimize HR and payroll operations to build great workforces. The services they are delivering start with implementation and migration and include fully managed outsourced services. Together with our operations in Prague and Barcelona, the Bucharest center enhances our capabilities in Europe. And while we're excited about our progress, it's even more satisfying when our clients recognize it. Last month, I had the pleasure of participating in ADP's annual Meeting of the Minds event in Nashville. The buzz and positive feedback we received from customers and industry analysts validated for me that we are, indeed, on the right path. It was great to share the stage with clients willing to talk about their experiences in driving specific, tangible value from our solutions. We're also proud of the recognition we continue to receive from third parties recognizing the value our solutions are delivering to the market. Most recently, NelsonHall, a global BPO analyst firm, named ADP a leader in recruitment process outsourcing. Their analysis recognizes our comprehensive recruitment service, which helps clients recruit high-quality talent at scale. This is a fantastic recognition as we continue to grow our BPO services. So we are pleased with the progress we are making on our strategy and believe it's contributing meaningfully to our performance. In the end, ADP is the only company that serves clients across the globe, across the full spectrum of HCM and across the full range of client sizes, and we have the resources, scale and expertise to meet the market needs. With this in mind, we are improving how we communicate the ADP brand to our clients and prospects. To better articulate what makes the ADP experience unique, we have developed a new tagline : ADP, a more human resource. We believe this tagline succinctly captures what sets us apart. We believe that software alone is not enough. To win in HCM requires deep expertise and outstanding service to help clients not just manage their employees, but build better workforces. We love this new tagline, which you'll start seeing in the market shortly. Overall, we have great confidence in our team, our strategy, our ability to execute and our message to the market. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jan to walk you through the third quarter results. Jan Siegmund : Thank you very much, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. For the quarter, ADP's revenue grew 7% and pretax earnings grew 12%. This revenue and pretax earnings growth includes a negative impact of approximately 2 percentage points from the effects of foreign currency translation. Earnings per share grew 16% in the quarter on a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with the year ago and included a negative impact of about $0.02 from the effects of foreign currency translation. I'm pleased with this solid performance despite the headwinds experienced from foreign currency. Our tax rate was lower than anticipated in the quarter as we were able to realize benefits from certain tax items that were not previously forecasted. ADP remains committed to shareholder-friendly actions and has repurchased more than 13 million shares throughout the end of the third quarter at a cost of $1.1 billion. These share repurchases were partially funded by the dividend proceeds of $825 million ADP received from CDK as a result of the spin-off, which occurred on September 30. Employer Services revenues grew 5% and were negatively impacted by 3 percentage points from foreign currency translation. This revenue growth was driven primarily by additions of our new recurring revenues from our HCM solutions as well as the benefit of revenues from certain tax credits filed on behalf of our clients that we received in the third quarter of this fiscal year. While our client revenue retention was down in the quarter compared with last year, and we are paying attention to this change, on a fiscal year-to-date basis, our retention remains at record levels. Same-store pays per control in the U.S. remained strong with an increase of 3.1%. Average client fund balances grew 4%. This growth was driven by net new business and growth in pays per control, but was moderated by decreased balances from lower state unemployment tax rates compared with the prior year in the U.S. -- as U.S. employment continues to improve as well as the negative effects of foreign currency translation. Our international business continues to perform well with growth coming from each major geographic region that we serve. Multinational solutions continue to perform very well with solid revenue and earnings growth. And while the economic situation in Europe is showing some signs of improvement, we are seeing some slowdown in our Latin American business. Our pretax margin expansion in Employer Services was 190 basis points in the quarter, primarily from scale and productivity. The PEO posted 15% revenue growth compared to last year's third quarter with growth in average worksite employees of 13%. And although this growth has slowed from the first half of the fiscal year because of a difficult compare, the business continues to perform well as more businesses seek to fully outsource their HCM needs. The PEO continues to deliver solid margin expansion through sales productivity and operating efficiencies, expanding margins by approximately 150 basis points in the quarter. ADP's consolidated pretax margin improved by 110 basis points in the third quarter, which included a drag of about 20 points from the slower growth of our high-margin client funds interest revenues as these highly profitable revenues grew at a slower rate than overall revenues. So now I will take you through our updated fiscal 2015 outlook. As Carlos mentioned earlier in the call, we are still anticipating worldwide new business bookings growth of about 10%. Because of the negative FX anticipated from foreign currency translation, we are now anticipating revenue growth for total ADP of about 7% compared with our prior forecast of 7% to 8%. Our revenue forecast for Employer Services still anticipates growth of about 5%. This forecast includes a negative drag of about 2 percentage points for the fiscal year due to foreign currency translation. However, the impact on the full year growth is expected to be more pronounced in the fourth fiscal quarter. This forecast assumes pays per control growth of about 3% compared with our prior forecast of 2% to 3% growth. For the PEO, we are now anticipating revenue growth of about 16% compared with our prior forecast of 15% to 17%. Our forecast anticipates pretax margin expansion for total ADP of at least 75 basis points from 18.4% at fiscal year 2014 compared with our prior forecasted range of 75 to 100 basis points of pretax margin expansion. On a segment level, we are revising our fiscal year 2015 forecast for Employer Services pretax margin expansion to contemplate our year-to-date results and are now anticipating margin expansion of about 125 basis points compared with our prior forecast of about 100 basis points. We are now anticipating about 100 basis points of margin expansion in the PEO. We have narrowed our forecast for the client funds extended investment strategy. And primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation on interest earned outside of the U.S., we are now anticipating an increase of about $5 million over the last year. This compares with the prior forecast of an increase of $5 million to $15 million over last year. This forecast anticipates average client fund balances growth of about 5%, which is at the low end of our prior range of 5% to 7%. The detail of this forecast is available both in the press release and in the supplemental slides on our website. The improvement in our effective tax rate is expected to continue for the balance of the fiscal year and we are updating our forecasted effective tax rate to reflect this improvement. We are now anticipating tax rate of 33.7% compared with our prior forecasted tax rate of 34.2%. This tax rate improvement, combined with the impact of share repurchases on our earnings per share growth, is expected to offset earnings pressure we anticipate from foreign currency translation. And due to the solid performance of our business year-to-date, we are now anticipating growth in diluted earnings per share of approximately 14% compared with our prior forecast of 12% to 14%. This forecast does not contemplate any further share buybacks beyond the anticipated dilution related to equity comp plans. However, it remains our intent to continue to return excess cash to shareholders subject to market conditions. With that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from the line of Sara Gubins from Bank of America. Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : First question on competition. I'm wondering if you could give us an update on the competitive environment around midsized clients for payroll services. Carlos A. Rodriguez: Our sales performance, I think, in the mid-market, I think was kind of in line with the overall results and maybe even a little bit stronger, but again we don't like to get into specific detail. That's really the only way -- we don't have a lot of other pieces of data or information that we can give you around -- specifics around competitors other than, for these quarterly calls, Jan and I both look at, in addition to the sales results, we look at win-losses against competitors whether it's in mid-market, upmarket or the low end of the market. And I would say that we're doing a little bit better from a sequential standpoint and executing really well, particularly in what we call the lower end of mid-market for us, which is we refer to it as core. We define mid-market as 50 to 1,000 employees and we define core as 50 to 150, and that's a place where I think our performance appears to have improved a little bit. But again, it's a limited amount of information, only 1 quarter's worth of data. But I think there's not much to report in terms of change there. I don't know if, Jan, you have anything? Jan Siegmund : I would say there's a -- continue to be competitive in the marketplace, but unchanged compared to prior quarters. No major change. Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Great. And just as a quick follow-up, at your Investor Day you spoke about the potential for leverage capacity given the move to the AA credit rating. I know that there's no particular rush as you think through that, but I'm wondering if you could give us an update on how you and the board are thinking about over the longer term. Carlos A. Rodriguez: Sounds like a question for the CFO, but since you're asking me, I'll take a stab at it and then I'll let Jan also answer. So I think that, as we acknowledged at our Investor Day, I think we, like everyone else, could see that our -- from a capital structure standpoint, we could probably optimize our capital structure a bit more and stay within, I think, our strong credit rating that we have that is important to us for a variety of reasons around our money movement strategies and client investment funds. So I think that we -- as you can tell over the last quarter, we returned the entire amount that we received from CDK, $825 million and then some, in the form of share repurchases back to shareholders. That still leaves us with a, what I would call, a very comfortable amount of cash on the balance sheet. And as you know, we're not really market timers and so we believe in steady returns to our shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases without trying to actually time the market. So I think, today, as we sit here today, we're comfortable with where we are, but highly aware of the capacity that we have on our balance sheet. And again, that's a discussion that we've been actively engaged in with the board and I think as things develop and we have more to report, we will. But I think we don't want to be shy about making sure that it's clear that we are certainly considering the potential to optimize our capital structure and add some debt to the balance sheet. So Jan? Jan Siegmund : I think that captures it. I think relative to the time line, Sara, it's kind of this year, we have been focused on returning the dividend to our shareholders. And as we evaluate that, we would update, of course, the investment community about the progress. But right now, there is no update, really. Operator : Our next question comes from Smittipon Srethapramote from Morgan Stanley. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : This Danyal Hussain calling for Smitti. Just wanted to touch on R&D in light of sunsetting EasyPay. Perhaps could you just give us an update on where you are in terms of R&D spend and how that's, right now, broken down between maintenance and new product development? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Yes, so we've actually set a goal 3 or 4 years ago, to try to move how much we were spending on maintenance versus -- and I think what we relayed to you was that about 40% of our R&D spend was on new and 60% was on maintenance. And so I think it's a couple of quarters ago that we actually switched that around and now we're spending 60% on new and 40% on old. I think as Jan likes to point out to the organization, some of that is because our total spend has gone up and most of that spend, the increased spend, is on new. And so we have not necessarily decreased dramatically our spend on some of our legacy platforms, but as you can tell from our financials over the last 2 or 3 years, we have been steadily increasing our R&D spend. In grand ADP fashion, it's not -- it may not jump out at you, it may not be dramatic, but it is for us because we've been growing our P&L view spend at the same rate as revenue growth, which means as we get margin improvement in other areas from service, operations, implementation and sales because this is a place where we've not been trying to get operating leverage is in R&D. And so as you see those increased spend levels -- which, by the way, don't reflect really the true picture of our gross spend, which includes capitalized software, which you could see through our balance sheet and through our 10-Qs and our other reporting. But I think the message you should take away is that we have been, in ADP terms, spending aggressively on R&D, we believe for the right reasons, and I think it will translate into a better competitive set of products for us as you've seen already happen here over the last 2 or 3 years with some of our strategic platforms that we already have in the market. But the bottom line is, I think as we've increased the spend overall and we've held or slightly decreased the spend on our legacy platforms, that mix has shifted over now to 60% on new products and services and 40% on old. So we're very, very happy about that because that was a goal that we set several years ago that, by the way, happened to be in my management MBOs and as well as my team's because we think it's the right thing to do to continue to invest more in product and technology. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Got it. And just looking at Employer Services growth, I guess, FX adjusted, it looks like it was about 8%. So you mentioned the tax credits, can you just talk a little bit about what else is driving the strength there and how much of that tax credit benefit is sort of onetime in nature? Jan Siegmund : The Tax Credit Services business that we have as part of our Employer Services business is a long-running business. It suffered from the lack of renewal by Congress of certain return-to-work credits in the past years. So those tax credits have been reinstated and the business is in catch-up mode to collect those tax credits for our clients and receive the fees for it. So while the revenue is bumpy, I wouldn't describe it as onetime revenues because these are long-term processing contracts that we have with our clients. They are just dependent on the U.S. government and Congress to renew at certain time points for it. So they were suspended and we lacked the revenue throughout the last 4 quarters; and this quarter, the revenues started to kick in and they contribute a little bit more than a percentage point to the growth about. So it's just part of our business that now regains momentum as part of it. Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets. Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : The PEO, you've had at several quarters in a row really strong margin expansion after what has been more -- much more flattish, up a little, down a little over the last few years. What's really driven that this year? Is it a change in the pass-throughs? Or are you getting more leverage because of the faster growth you've been delivering? And how do we think about that going forward? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Well, I think first and foremost, you always have to give credit to the people on the ground running the business, so I think they -- that's number one. I think it's good execution and -- but I think you're right that it also, particularly in that business, the mathematics matter. And so the faster these pass-throughs grow, the harder it is to get margin expansion from a percentage standpoint. We try to focus more on dollars of profit per worksite employee or dollars of profit overall from that segment rather than margin percentage because of the pass-throughs. But you're correct that a slightly slower growth rate of pass-throughs mathematically helps in terms of achieving percentage margin improvement. But notwithstanding that, I think we have both things happening. We have slightly slower growth of pass-through, which helps make -- helps create the environment for potential margin improvement, and then they've just executed incredibly well. They've gotten good operating leverage, including on the distribution side, so the sales productivity there has been phenomenal as you've seen from the sales results over the last 2, 3, 4 quarters and that obviously helps quite a bit because sales costs tend to be relatively fixed, and if you get big improvements in sales results, you get nice productivity lift there. And that business tends to start relatively quickly as compared to some of our other businesses in the upmarket, so you get some of that margin help from distribution costs relatively quickly. The last thing that I'll mention is, just as a caution, is that's a 10 percentage -- around a 10% to 11% margin business right now in large part because of the pass-throughs. So in the end, because of the size of the pass-throughs and the level of the margin, that's a business that you should expect modest margin improvement from. So the results that you're seeing from a margin standpoint are terrific, frankly impressive, but not sustainable. So just to be clear. And part of that is because you never know what's going to happen with the pass-throughs and we have some visibility to that, so we would obviously give you guidance in the appropriate time frame in August around what's happening with pass-throughs. But in general, when you really run through -- if you take 5 minutes to run through the mathematics, it is a business that is inherently a lower margin than our other business, but we still love it because it's -- like our other businesses, it's not capital intensive, and every dollar of profit that we generate in that segment is a dollar of profit that goes to our shareholders, into our EPS. And so we love that business despite the fact that it requires some explanation around the percentage margin. Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : The point on profit per average worksite employees is a good one. I think I've got 10 years of data I'm looking at here, and it looks like you're trending towards, by far, the highest level that, that's ever been, up solid double digits this year. And so is it the sales leverage you mentioned and I guess just leverage of fixed cost with the business growing faster? But is there any reason that level of profits wouldn't be sustainable or be able to continue to trend somewhat higher? Carlos A. Rodriguez: As in all businesses, that level of profitability is dependent on your differentiation and your competitive position in the market. In other words, how strong your value proposition is. We feel very, very bullish and very good about not only the execution of that business today, but also the value proposition in part because of how complex the environment has gotten because of ACA for all employers, not just for large employers. So this is just really creating, I think, a natural trend towards people looking for help. And you could get help in a variety of ways, and the good news is ADP has all types of ways we can help you, all the way from basic payroll to the PEO, which is the ultimate BPO bundle. And I think this kind of environment where you have increased regulatory compliance and complexity around health care is really a very, very favorable environment for the PEO. But on top of that, I think the PEO has not been, to their credit, over the last 5 years, has not just been sitting there kind of waiting for things to happen on the regulatory front. They've also made great strides in terms of the products and services that they deliver and the value that they add to the clients that they serve. And again, this is not the appropriate call to get into those details, but we feel very, very bullish about the value proposition that has emerged there over the last 3 to 5 years. Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Great. And then just a quick follow-up, Carlos, you said you didn't -- it's great that you're selling more HCM into RUN customers, but it doesn't impact revenue. Is that just a scale issue? Or is there some other reason that's not really benefiting? Carlos A. Rodriguez: It is a little bit of a scale issue that, obviously because this is the conundrum that we always have when we talk about ADP is, in some respect, it's a good thing that we serve all markets globally at all levels in all segments. That really means that any 1 segment in 1 country doesn't usually move the needle when it -- we need multiple parts of ADP moving in tandem to really move the needle. And so the SBS business, our downmarket business is a scaled business and it's a nice-sized business, but the amount of additional HCM penetration that you get as we migrated clients over in relation to the total size of that business and the total size of ADP just doesn't -- it doesn't register. So we appreciate it and it helps the overall cause, but we added that line in the script because we want you to understand that we're not getting $40 million, $50 million of lift in 1 year from that. Now over time, if we end up having a higher penetration rate of things like HR, and time and attendance, and insurance services, and 401(k) and other products because the RUN product itself is easier to use and more integrated, then that, over time, would help us. But just the nature of our business model, these are not big onetime lifts that we got, and we just want to make sure that, that was clear to all of you. But we're very happy about it, and it also was an indirect way of making sure that you understood that if we get similar, which we are, getting similar lift in mid-market and upmarket where you would assume and we are experiencing higher penetration rates of some of these other products, some of these other HCM products, that it bodes well for us as we continue these migrations and we complete some of the migrations in of some of our other segments. We think it could be a more significant lift than what we experienced already in our low end. Operator : Our next question comes from S.K. Prasad Borra from Goldman Sachs. Siva Krishna Prasad Borra - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Probably just to start off, as you continue to increase your focus on expanding your HR suite, what are the metrics you are using internally to judge your success, both from an R&D and sales perspective? Is it the number of products you're offering? Is it attach rates? And if you could provide any update on attach rates post migration. Carlos A. Rodriguez: I know Jan has those attach rates at the tip of his tongue, and I think that's probably, besides our sales results and the attach rates in our upfront sales, I think the attach rates on our migrations, those 2 metrics are important metrics for us to judge our success of kind of our overall HCM strategy. So for example, in the upmarket, Jan has the exact numbers, but when you compare to kind of prior platforms that we had, the attach rates are much higher of the traditional HCM products around time and attendance, benefits, HR, talent, et cetera, and we're experiencing the same thing in mid-market where the concept of a seamless product that provides the entire solution in one-stop shopping, I think, is resonating in the marketplace. But what we needed to have is the products to actually reflect that, and I think we have that now in our strategic products and we're seeing it in the sales results. And now what you've been hearing us talk about over the last 2 or 3 years that we want to do that also with our client base by moving them on to our strategic products, which is what we just finished doing in Small Business and we're now trying to do in mid-market and also in national accounts. So I don't know, Jan, if you have the attach rates. Jan Siegmund : Yes, we have. In the upmarket, there's really no change from what we have reported in prior quarters in the mid-70s to low 70s for some of these modules, but they remain high for Vantage. And in the mid-market for Workforce Now, we have seen actually some increase in the attach rate of our benefits bundle that we believe coincides with strong interest of our ACA offerings. So there's definitely something going on in the mid-market driving demand for a complete -- more complete bundle including benefits due to the insurance changes and things. So we're looking at these attach rates, which are important for new clients as well as for migrated clients and how they buy. And the trend has continued really in line with the numbers that we have previously disclosed. There's no big change. Carlos A. Rodriguez: I think we should be clear that our sales force responds to product -- to good product and the market responds to good product. So for example, the release of our recent talent solutions, you could see, as I was going through some of the data for the call, you could see a fairly large jump, which we're not going to give the specific percentages, but a meaningful and significant jump in attach rates in new sales as -- since we released our new talent solutions. So I think we remain on the same track of being confident that, despite the fact that we want to continue to focus on our compliance, on our service, that product really matters and really drives our attach rates. Siva Krishna Prasad Borra - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : That's great. Just following up on one of the earlier questions on the PEO business, taking into consideration the pass-through costs and the mechanics related to that, but are there any other levers for margin expansion? You alluded to expansion of your products and services in this business. So can those products and services provide some upside, more from a mid- to long-term perspective, but are we going to be just range stuck? Or do you think these newer products and services should just allow you to expand margins? Carlos A. Rodriguez: We're never going to be range stuck. So I believe that -- what I was trying to make sure that I communicated is that the improvements that you should expect are not along the lines of 10% going to 20% over 3 years. It's more in the line of 10.5% going to 10.8% or 10.9% and then 10.9% going to 11.2%. It's just a different situation. When you have more than half of your revenues, we treat more than half of those revenues as pass-through revenues, and they literally are pass-through in the sense that on the health care side, we take no risk and we basically pass through the costs that we pay for those health care plans to the employees of our clients and to the clients, depending on which percent the client pays versus the employees. That just mathematically creates a very different opportunity for margin expansion than in a business where you have 90% to 100% of the costs available for leverage. And so we just -- we have a -- the value proposition can get stronger. And the other half of our revenue, so the other products and services that we provide that we charge administrative fees for, are leverageable and we can get operating scale from. But it's just mathematically important for people to understand that in that business there is a limit because of the large pass-throughs. But we do not believe that we're range stuck, and what we don't want is to take advantage of the largest leverage opportunity, which is slower growth. And so in all of the ADP businesses including the PEO, the fact of the matter is that distribution costs, even though we're getting operating leverage from distribution costs in the PEO today, the fact of the matter is that the faster we grow because of the nature of the business, we book all of our distribution expense up front. And so fast growth puts very, very big pressure and it's really quite impressive the business is performing the way it is given the high sales growth and the high revenue growth. So we hope that, that doesn't happen any time in the near future, but that would be probably the largest single source of operating leverage and margin improvement someday down the road is slower growth. Operator : Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : This is Ashish Sabadra calling on behalf of Bryan Keane. I was just wondering if you could provide some more color on [Audio Gap]. We saw that decline 50 basis points this quarter. Was there any large client? Or was it mostly in the small and medium businesses? Carlos A. Rodriguez: So as you know, we typically don't get into specifics around where our retention is going up or down. And so the good news is that for several quarters as retention went up, we didn't get into the details and didn't brag. And so we're going to take the same approach today, which is this has happened before. I think it was probably 4, 5 quarters ago where we do have variability and it does tend to happen more in the upmarket where, when transactions or deals are large enough, they can move the needle in any 1 quarter. But today, we have really nothing to report other than, on a year-to-date basis, we're still about 10 basis points above last year and still at record levels. And so I think Jan put it well, which is we're going to obviously watch this very, very carefully and we are obviously watching it and digging in and looking at to see if there's anything underneath the covers. But we spend a lot of time on this topic. And today, we really don't have anything to report other than the usual fluctuations in the business. I don't know if, Jan, you have... Jan Siegmund : I think, in particular, between the second and the third quarter, you should be aware there can be timing of losses between those 2 quarters. So we -- the more reliable number is really the year-to-date number because we can have timing differences and prior year timing differences that make the quarterly number a little bit harder to interpret, so that I don't think we should put -- other than you pay attention to your retention, put -- read too much into it one way or the other. Carlos A. Rodriguez: And I think we said in prior calls that of all -- as people think about us going forward, including at Investor Day, this is not a place where we are making assumptions of 1 to 2 percentage points of retention improvement over the next 2 or 3 years. We've been in this business for so long that we know exactly what is realistic and reasonable and what isn't. And it's possible that as we go through these migrations, that we end up in a different place with a higher potential retention rate than what we've had historically because we'll be in a stronger competitive position. But from here to there, it's still multiyears, and from here to there, there's going to be turbulence as we go through some of these migrations. So we're not giving up and are not saying that there isn't a potential higher absolute retention rate that could be achievable, but we have enough experience and know enough to tell you that, and we've said it multiple times in prior calls, that when we are at record client retention levels, that is not the time to be factoring in big increases in retention going forward. Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Just quickly, on Europe, I was wondering if you could provide some more color on the European business and how do the people control trending in Europe? Carlos A. Rodriguez: So coincidentally, I happened to be in Europe last week and the environment in Europe is obviously, from an employment standpoint, not fabulous : slow GDP growth, high unemployment, and relatively, the labor markets experience enough friction that it's not a place where you have big fluctuations either up or down. So the good news is as the economy tends to weaken in Europe, you don't have the same level of decrease of employment and layoffs that you have -- it takes a little longer. Having said that, the absolute levels of unemployment and the absolute levels of GDP are not attractive backdrops for those markets for us. And for our total international business, Europe is the largest single segment of our international business by a long shot. So we do have a fair amount of exposure there as you've noticed from the FX pressure that we just experienced. But relative to other companies, it's relatively contained. We have less than 20% of our revenues coming from our international business and only a portion of that is from Europe. But having said that, my view of Europe is that -- and it's a big continent so it's hard to make a generalization. But overall, when you consider the backdrop and the macroeconomic environment, I would say it's been outstanding performance in the business in terms of new business sales, client retention and revenue growth. So as we've said in prior quarters, it's not necessarily additive. Europe has not been additive to our growth rate from a revenue standpoint, but it is positive. And relative to what you hear in terms of other stories, of other situations in other industries, we're very, very pleased with the performance of that business and the leadership there. So one of the interesting things that I saw when I was visiting Europe as I spent some time in the U.K., and the U.K. is actually a nice example of what might be achievable for us over the next 10 to 20 years. In the U.K., we have strong product from a technology standpoint. We have Money Movement operations that are generating float income. We have time and attendance systems that we have now added, along with HR, to our payroll to really create an HCM solution. And so it's really a great example of what I think might be achievable for us worldwide and creates some potential growth opportunity for us for many, many years to come because it's really a replication of a little bit of what we've done in the U.S. Obviously, every country and every situation is going to be different in terms of the product needs and the regulatory environment, but in general, I think it supports the notion that the ADP model is replicable in other parts of the world where we have very, very low market share today. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Marcon from Robert W Baird. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : With regards to international, just a little more color, if you could, with regards to what you're seeing in terms of the play or the strategy in terms of expanding globally. Can you give us some sense in terms of what sort of deals you're seeing? What the pipeline looks like? How quickly you think you may be able to expand and ramp that? Carlos A. Rodriguez: We appreciate all the questions about international because we do tend to be creatures of habit here and focus a lot on our U.S. business, which obviously is our most mature business, but our biggest opportunities undoubtedly from a growth standpoint are outside of the U.S., and I'm talking 5, 10, 20 years down the road. The biggest single positive thing that we're seeing right now is our multinational solutions. So I also spent some time when I was in Europe in Prague, where we have a high concentration of our multinational solutions folks working, providing service there and from a service -- from a Center of Excellence. And the performance of our multinational business is really quite phenomenal. And I remember 2 or 3 years ago, every quarter getting questions about whether GlobalView was going to be profitable or when it was going to break even and so forth, and I'm not going to get into the details of the profitability of GlobalView, but the way it always happens in business, once things get paused and no one stops -- no one continues to ask questions about it. But it was a very, very positive view in Prague because the NPS scores of that multinational business -- and we define multinational as not just GlobalView, but also our Streamline solutions because clients don't care whether it's GlobalView or Streamline. They see it as one integrated multinational solution. And the NPS scores there are, particularly on the GlobalView platform side, are up. Again, I'm not going to get into the specifics, but they're up a lot versus 3 or 4 years ago. Profitability, it's not just a break-even business anymore; it's a very profitable business. Growth, strong double-digit growth in that business. That's a business that, it's approaching, including its backlog, around $0.5 billion business still growing nicely and still every quarter generating new clients that are really the who's who of the Global 100. So it's just a phenomenal opportunity for us, the multinational opportunity overall. In addition to that, what we're doing to some of our platforms in North America and probably eventually we'll do some of the same things to some of our more in-country, best-of-breed solutions is allowing those platforms to also be global. So for example, being able to -- without having to move to necessarily a multinational solution, having Vantage or Workforce Now have global capabilities is something that we have now that we believe will drive some additional opportunity for us in North America. So the whole global landscape, I think, is an important one for ADP over the next X number of decades and we're still on it. Even though we tend to be creatures of habit and go back to talking about balances in the U.S. and growth of our sales in Employer Services domestically, it's a very, very important part of our future and we're still focused on it. Obviously, the fact that the European business, which is a significant part of our company -- I'm sorry, a significant part of our international results, has had the kind of economic backdrop that it has had, has probably caused us to be less talkative about our international business, but we're not any less excited about it. I think Latin America and Asia also continue to grow very rapidly. But again, they're so small still in relative terms to $11 billion as a total company that it's just going to take a while for us to be able to report that it's actually having a significant impact on the overall results. I don't know, Jan, if you have anything you want to add on the international front. Jan Siegmund : No, I think that the multinational is the key driver for us, and ADP is the clear market leader in that space. And that drives that multinational business that is now close to $0.5 billion, so that's really what makes it successful. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : That's great to hear. And then just a follow-up, you mentioned Vantage and the potential to take that international. Can you just give us a progress report on Vantage? You've done such a great job on RUN and Workforce Now. Where do we stand with Vantage? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Yes, let me just clarify. It's really -- providing global capabilities to Vantage is different from taking it internationally, although I guess that's semantics, but I just want to make sure that I clarify that. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Understood. Carlos A. Rodriguez: I think that Vantage continues to perform well. We believe that for -- based on the track that we're on now in terms of sales year-to-date, that we will have good growth of Vantage over the prior year in terms of new business sales. We have a couple of hundred clients sold, I think over 100 now implemented. So we're very -- we continue to be very excited. That's our strategic platform in the upmarket, and we think it's continuing to perform well. I think Jan mentioned the attach rates. It's very, very exciting for us to see attach rates in the kind of 70 percentage range for, I believe that's for benefits -- sorry, for time and attendance. And then benefits and talent and HR are like -- HR is automatically part, it's 100% attached. But when you look at talent and benefits in the 60s, I think 60 percentage range, those are much higher attach rates than when we used to sell a separate payroll module with a separate benefits platform with a separate time and attendance system. So this seamless integration works and it's driving higher attach rates, and I think it's also driving stronger value proposition in the marketplace. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. Ryan Cary - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : This is Ryan Cary for Jason. I was just hoping you could just speak to some of the trends in new business bookings. I know growth in the first half of the year came against a weaker comparison, at least compared to the 14% in third quarter of '14. Is the third quarter 6% due primarily to the tougher comp? Or is there something else? And just rough ask, it looks like the guidance suggests about 8% in the fourth quarter. How should we be thinking about this number trending as we, say, get beyond '15? Carlos A. Rodriguez: So it's a good question. This may help you, that the 6% was actually exactly 100% of our plan for sales for the third quarter. So I think that, that's probably an indication that it was in line with our expectations. We always like to be positively surprised, but we knew that we had a 14% growth rate last year in the third quarter -- is it -- was it 14%? 14% in the third quarter last year, which is, at our size -- again, we're selling $1.6 billion annually. So the quarter obviously is approximately 1/4 of that. These are big numbers. And so when you have a 14% growth -- again, we've been doing this long enough that we know, as you can tell from the planning process, a planned 6% growth and so -- and I think we tried to telegraph that and signal it as best we could in the March Analyst Day and through other means. So I think we're exactly on plan. Very excited that we're 11% year-to-date compared to 8% last year, year-to-date. So we are nothing but positive and bullish on our sales force and our distribution, and I think the trends are positive. We're -- I don't know how else to, I guess, to put it. Like we're -- at this size, I'm just thrilled that we can get double-digit sales growth because that is exactly what we need to drive the financial results that we're trying to drive for our shareholders. Ryan Cary - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Great. And just as a follow-up. At the recent Analyst Day, you spoke a lot about the new technology and offerings, particularly speaking about big data and analytics. When do you believe these could be needle-moving to results? Or do you see these offerings more along the lines of helping to win new clients? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Well, I think winning new clients would be needle-moving. I think that's what -- I think that it's a part of the ongoing, I think, desire to create a stronger value proposition and to differentiate ourselves. So I think that if you hear a slight change in our tone as we keep talking about HCM and about helping our clients build better workforces and also focusing on their business results, that's really where the big data comes into play. Like, we think that besides the traditional strength that we have around operating efficiencies and compliance, all the things that we're traditionally known for, for getting mission-critical employment-related tasks done, in addition to that, if we can help our clients do better by giving them more information to make better decisions around their people, we think that creates a stronger value proposition and should lead to more client wins and hopefully higher market share. Because at the end of the day, we talked about this at Analyst Day, there really is no company where the people are not the most important asset. Even if you employ a lot of equipment and you're a manufacturer, at the end of the day because of what's happening with technology, people are the difference maker. And so hiring the best people, keeping the best people and making sure that you are -- that they have the proper training and that you are tracking their performance and compensating them the right way through compensation systems and managing that talent, these are all crucial parts of our HCM strategy that we think are going to drive additional sales in the form of new client wins and hopefully a slightly better market share over time. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research : Jan, in your remarks, when you were talking about the funds-held balances, you mentioned something about lower balances because of SUI tax rates going down. I just want to confirm that, if you can give a little bit more color. And is this an issue that we need to think about in the upcoming quarters as well? Jan Siegmund : Yes, I think we adjusted our forecast for the client-fund balances to the lower end. So the SUI impact is traditionally the biggest impact in the third quarter. These are the withholding rates for unemployment taxes, and if the economy improves, traditionally, SUI rate should go down because the high employment and unemployment funds are better funded as a consequence. So that was a large driver for the decline this quarter. And we have also actually measurable impact on the growth due to the currency translation that we have for our Canadian client fund balances that actually impacted the overall growth. So I think that's going to be to-be-continued for sure in the fourth quarter, and then we'll give guidance for '15 in August. Carlos A. Rodriguez: And I think one thing that I need just to add because I think a number of people here hate it when I do this, but I just can't resist. Reminding you that in fiscal year '08, we generated $691 million from the net client funds strategy on approximately $15 billion of balances. In fiscal year '15, we'll generate around $420 million on $22 billion of balances, and I think that just shows the magnitude of what's happened in terms of our yield going from 4.4% in fiscal year '08 to 1.89% today in fiscal year '15. And we have no expectations that we're going to achieve 4.4% any time in the near future, so we get that. But I just want to make sure that everyone understands the magnitude of the pressure that we've been able to get ourselves through here and the potential opportunity down the road because our balances obviously have grown despite this little hiccup with unemployment in the quarter, which, frankly, tends to happen every time there's an employment cycle that's improving, and it's just very hard to predict exactly where that state unemployment level is going to come down. But overall, our balances are still up from $15.7 billion to $22.1 billion, and unfortunately, interest rates have not cooperated with us during that period of time. But I think history tells us that we will have our day. Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research : Okay, appreciate you pointing that out again. And actually, just shifting gears back to the discussion about your international business. If I remember correctly, you get about 11% or 12% of your total revenues from Europe. Is there a major difference between your Employer Services and your PEO Services in terms of the exposure there? Carlos A. Rodriguez: The PEO has no exposure outside of the U.S. I don't know if that was the question, but the PEO is an only-U.S. business, not even North America. It's U.S.-only business. So there's no exposure internationally and we really don't break out -- Employer Services is reported as one segment from a segment reporting standpoint, but I think that you're generally correct or close in percentage that Europe would represent of our overall results. Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research : Okay. I just wanted to make sure there weren't any other HCM businesses in the PEO segment. It doesn't sound like there is. Carlos A. Rodriguez: No, it is an HCM business. There's no possible way because it does everything. It's already like a bundle from -- all the way from recruitment to retirement. Operator : Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : I like your new tagline, by the way. Can you give an idea of -- as you're driving these substantially increased attach rates, what type of revenue uplift you're looking for or aspiring for, like sort of in the ideal scenario where a client buys kind of like the full suite as you've got it defined today? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Well, obviously, it clearly depends on whether they buy 1, 2 or 3 additional modules in addition to kind of our core payroll. But again, just to put it into context so -- because, again, because of the way our business model works, these things take time and work slowly over time. But in -- as an example, the older platforms that we have where the clients have only payroll, when they migrate over to a new platform if they purchase a couple of additional modules, you can literally get, in some cases, up to 2x or 3x revenue multiple. Not every client that migrates does that. Some purchase one module, some purchase 2 models. But the numbers are fairly significant and we have not only kind of a traditional HCM modules that people can purchase and attach on to, but we are releasing obviously new products as things go forward like, for example, our Health Compliance solutions are an additional charge and they're not really in the category of benefits or time and attendance. They are an additional sale, if you will, that people can purchase that adds also to the overall revenue number. And I think if I'm not mistaken, Jan, maybe can help me, but I think -- I can't remember what the percentages of our new sales come from, I guess, additional attach rates versus -- but it's a fairly healthy number. Jan Siegmund : It's a healthy number. I think we roughly say 50%-50% new clients versus incremental business to it, although the consideration has to be that in the lower end, it's clearly much higher on acquiring new clients; whereas on the upper end, as you know, we serve 90% of the Fortune 100 companies. So there's a -- naturally it will be almost all incremental and upsell. So it shifts fairly smoothly from small to low in how we distribute, but a very important component is selling incremental modules to our existing clients. Carlos A. Rodriguez: And I think that -- that was my recollection, is around 50-50. And just to be clear in terms of what our strategic objective is, which is not to have that number become 40-60 or 30-70. We want to grow both and so we are -- part of what we're driving around our technology solutions and our investments in product is that we want to win market share, and we want to win additional clients. We also want to benefit from these higher attach rates, which we are benefiting from. But one of the very, very important objectives that we have internally is to really be much more attentive to unit growth and to market share. And the good news is that, that's been a pretty good story here for the last few years, but we're going to still stay focused on that because we're not trying only to grow through higher attach rates. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Terrific. And then, you've been a little bit quiet so far on M&A. Can you just give us an update on if there's particular areas you're looking at for acquisitions either product or geography, I suppose? Carlos A. Rodriguez: Other than telling you we're not the ones buying Salesforce.com, I don't -- we really don't have much to add versus what we said at the March analyst meeting, which is we recognize, again, because of our capital situation, that we have capital, that we can deploy in a variety of ways in terms of returning cash to shareholders, but also reinvesting in the business organically and also potentially for M&A. But I think we've become -- I think we've put ourselves in a box, so to speak, because we have to be very, very careful and very, very disciplined because it's going to be hard for me to convince you that it made sense to buy another payroll platform or another benefit platform and that, that makes sense for us. And I'm making it even harder for myself now that I'm saying this on a call because it's not our strategy. Our strategy is to create seamless, integrated solutions that we build ourselves organically, right, and that have an incredible UI and an incredible experience from a user standpoint for the clients and for the employees of our clients. So creating more migration issues and more platform proliferation is not our #1 objective. Having said that, you should know that we are actively looking at things and actively in the market because you never say never and you have to be willing to accept the fact that we're not great at everything and so we know that. And so as long as something fits into our strategic direction and as long as it's on our terms, we're going to use our capital. But today, we have nothing to report. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt O'Neill from Autonomous Research. Matthew O'Neill - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division : You answered most of my questions already, but I figured just to round out the discussion on international, if you could just add a little bit more color to the LATAM discussion or the weakness there that you mentioned. Is that just macro FX based? Or is there anything else to think about there? Jan Siegmund : I think we mentioned Latin America because, in prior calls, we talked about the success story that Brazil really was for us over the last few years with very high growth rates and great performance. And the current slowdown in Latin America, I think, particularly in Brazil, is mostly due to the softening of the economic environment in that country. So there's really not -- it's not that material actually to the overall result, but we felt it was consistent as we had bragged about it and talked about the success in prior quarters that we would update also when it's getting a little bit slower. Carlos A. Rodriguez: And if we brag about the progress of GlobalView or our multinational solutions over multiple years, we have to brag about Brazil as well. So there's no question that a good economic environment there, prior to this last year or 2, helped a little bit. But we have a great team there that's executing very well and has helped us expand into a few other countries in South America. And so we're still long term very bullish on the management team there and on the business there. But I think Jan is correct that I think we have to make sure that we help you understand kind of where things are going in terms of the different parts of our business. But we're still incredibly excited about what they've accomplished. Again, not for today, it's too much detail, but the last 5 years have been an amazing run for that business. Operator : Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore. David Togut - Evercore ISI, Research Division : I apologize if this has been addressed since I did join a little late from another call, but I noticed, Jan, you raised your ES pretax margin expansion target to 125 basis points. And my question is, does this represent the beginning of a more aggressive margin expansion trajectory for this business longer term? And if so, what would be the underlying drivers behind that? Carlos A. Rodriguez: It probably depends on who you ask. So Jan is over here smiling, thinking, yes, it does and I'm over here saying, no, it doesn't. And I think the truth is somewhere in between. Clearly, this business is performing better than it was sometime back from a margin standpoint. Some of that, in all fairness, is that we've -- our organic growth strategy, I think, has helped a little bit in the sense that we were relatively acquisitive in Employer Services over the years and that generally added margin pressure to us year-to-year. And eventually, those acquisitions helped with scale and should have been helping to drive margin, but it's just hard with a lot of M&A activity and a lot of noise in the system and a lot of platforms to drive good margin improvements. So I think that we haven't necessarily made huge progress, with the exception of EasyPay and a few other places on the migration front, but we certainly slowed the proliferation and the increase of, which I think creates a better backdrop for Employer Services to drive margin improvement. I think the second thing like I did with the PEO or with Brazil or with GlobalView, you've got to give credit to the people running those businesses. So there's really, really good execution on the ground as well. So having said all that, I really appreciate the question because it's important for people to get the tone from us, and I think Jan and I are on the same page, which is that you should not expect this kind of margin improvement in the future because we like -- or I, like many of my predecessors, are incredibly sensitive to making sure that we manage this business for the long term. And the long term doesn't mean like the next quarter; it means 3, 5, 10, 20 years down the road. And if you extrapolate 125 basis point margin improvement over 20 years, it becomes very, very difficult to believe. And so we are very, very committed to reinvesting in our business and that would make me nervous about pushing too hard on the margin front. So I guess the best way to answer this is that we're very, very comfortable with the guidance that we gave in March, which I believe was 50 to 75 basis point margin improvement over multiple years, and we're also very comfortable with the guidance that we've given for this year and we would not encourage you to focus on 1 quarter. David Togut - Evercore ISI, Research Division : That's very helpful. I asked the question, in part, given the increase in activism we're seeing in the sector, particularly among your former colleagues at Dealer Services. Carlos A. Rodriguez: Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Just a quick follow-up on the retention side. Any change in -- I've been giving this question a lot, any change in level of competitiveness from your rivals? I know Ultimate highlighted its largest win in their quarter. So any thoughts there, pricing, et cetera? Jan Siegmund : Well, look at the discount levels that we have in our sales, that's really unchanged year-over-year. So that substantiates our earlier comment that the competitive situation continues to be intense, but it has not dramatically changed over time. And we do focus on some of our key competitors, not naming any, and we have seen improvements for some of our competitors and we have improved our own performance, which we are very pleased with. Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Got it. So no real change then. It sounds like an intensity from the usual suspects. Is that fair? Jan Siegmund : Overall, yes. But as the portfolio has many competitors, some that you might be interested, I think we are doing pretty well actually. Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. Yes, that's historically been the case. I figured I'd ask. Just as a follow-up then, any change in ADP's share of wins coming from your referral partners? Jan Siegmund : Well, the referral partners are particularly important in our Small Business segment, and we're pleased with the channel -- the channels that we have built out. And they're wide ranging from banks over accountants to other referral channels, and they are an important source of our success in the downmarket. Carlos A. Rodriguez: And what the good news is, I think that some of that, as we've tried to become more \"One ADP\", some of the success I think is starting to move up into -- for example, the person who's running our Small Business division is now running our mid-market business. I think those types of things help in terms of spreading some of this knowledge of how much strong referral networks can help. So I think our mid-market business is -- now has a very robust referral network with insurance agents and brokers, in addition to traditional accountants that I think is helping that business as well. And in the upmarket, we have improved -- I think there's, again, nothing dramatic to report, but really improved the focus there with working with third parties as well including, for example, we created a little private equity group that works with private equity firms to help there as well. Operator : And our final question comes from Mark Marcon from Robert W Baird. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Just wanted to come back to the retention question. A year ago, in the third quarter, you had an 80 bp increase in your client retention. So it seems like it's a pretty tough comp. I was just wondering if you could kind of frame on a dollar basis where your retention is currently running and what a reasonable expectation is from a longer-term perspective. Jan Siegmund : Mark, I don't give you -- won't give you the dollar numbers, but maybe to help you, which I tried to explain earlier, this is -- what you're alluding in the compare to the third quarter prior year is definitely true. It's more difficult to compare with improvement of retention rate in the third quarter last year, and that retention rate may have been impacted if you look sequentially also. So you have to have a look sequential retention rates and year-over-year compare, which makes this a harder quarter to do so, but -- and you have natural variation in retention rates by quarter because some deals can move it. All these, together, make it risky, even if I were to give you these dollars to correctly interpret them. It's better to think about year-to-date in larger loss dollars aggregating to a total here for the good insight. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Yes, I was just thinking about percentage -- overall percentage retention. Carlos A. Rodriguez: We don't give that quarterly. We only provide that once a year. But again, our forecast is -- again our internal forecast, we have 1 quarter left and so if we had something dramatic to report, we would. So I think that we expect to have retention be where we expected it to be for the year. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Which was? Jan Siegmund : Which is I think we guided to prior year. Sara Grilliot : We actually don't guide. Jan Siegmund : We don't guide, but about record high. Sara Grilliot : Yes. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I'm pleased to hand the program back over to Mr. Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos A. Rodriguez: So thank you for joining us today for the call. I think just a couple of points. One is, as you can tell, we continue to be very, very sensitive to making sure that we're treating our shareholders well. We said that we were going to return the $825 million dividend that we've received from CDK and we did that via the share repurchase that exceeded the $1.1 billion. And so I think you'll continue to see us focusing on returning capital to our shareholders. The other thing that I just wanted to mention is we really had the same kind of pressures that everyone else is having from foreign currency translation and we may not have focused as much as others, but very, very pleased that despite that pressure, which was significant both on the top line and on the bottom line, that our year-to-date performance was -- I'm sorry, that our quarter performance and our year-to-date performance are strong as they are. So I believe that, that is evidence that we continue to execute well against our HCM strategy. We appreciate the time today, and we look forward to having you join us again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes our program. You may all disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",

My name is Nicole and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to ADP's Fiscal 2015 Earnings Webcast. I'd like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I'll turn the conference over to Mr. Sara Grilliot, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Sara Grilliot - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. This a Sara Grilliot, ADP's Vice President, Investor Relations, and I am here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our fiscal 2015 earnings call and webcast. Carlos will begin today's call with some opening remarks and then Jan will take you through the fiscal 2015 financial results and our outlook for fiscal 2016. We will then take your questions. I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve some risks. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. With that, I will turn the call over to Carlos. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you, Sara. Good morning everyone. This morning, we reported fourth quarter and full fiscal 2015 results with revenue up 5% and 7%, respectively, despite continued pressure from foreign currency translation. Even more gratifying is our exceptionally strong performance on new business bookings, which grew considerably better than our expectations to 18% for the quarter and 13% for the year. Our strategy to drive sustainable growth at ADP is working, the result of which is strength across all three of our strategic pillars. In particular, ADP Health Compliance product line has been particularly well received in the market, significantly outpacing our internal expectations. We have brought our technology and expertise together in a way that meets an acute client need at a time when businesses are racing to ensure compliance with the Affordable Care Act. Our success here has resulted in higher than anticipated selling expenses ahead of related revenue and that has put significant but short-term pressure on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2015 margins and earnings. In order to transition this strong performance in new business bookings to recurring revenue, we are making additional investments in operational resources that will begin in the first half of fiscal 2016 and remain throughout the year. These investments are not expected to contribute meaningfully to recurring revenue until the second half of the fiscal year. Jan will further explain our expectations for fiscal 2016 later in the call. But before he does, let me give you other examples of how execution against our three strategic pillars is driving ADP's recent growth and future opportunities. As we have told you, we are all-in on HCM. Overall, it was a successful quarter and year for ADP, as we continued to grow our complete suite of cloud-based HCM solutions, delivering customer solutions that work together seamlessly. This past quarter, we introduced a number of enhancements across our major platforms. With RUN, we updated the entire user experience to simplify interaction with the platform for small business owners. We expanded the capabilities of Workforce Now, our HCM solution for midsized businesses, to include career and job portals as well as a consumer grade experience for employee benefit enrollment. And we delivered a new user experience for Vantage clients as well, which promise to be even more intuitive, engaging and contextual. And for certain clients on our strategic platforms, we were especially excited to introduce ADP DataCloud, which leverages ADP's unparalleled data and insight to deliver workforce analytics that can help boost productivity, help develop talent, increase retention and identify potential flight risks. About 1,000 ADP clients are already taking advantage of these analytical capabilities. Not only have we been busy on the technology front, but we have also been busy building partners through the ADP Marketplace. We're excited to have about 60 partners providing solutions through our secure application programming interfaces, or APIs, and there are another 200 that have expressed interest in partnering with us. This is an exciting development for us. We are attracting established leaders like Concur and Cornerstone OnDemand, as well as exciting emerging technologies, such as OnePage, which provides clients an innovative platform for engaging passive job seekers. The ADP Marketplace is a great example of ADP taking a client-centric, outside-in view of enhancing our HCM capabilities and creating best-in-class solutions for our clients. In fiscal 2015, we also continued to make progress in growing and scaling our market-leading HR BPO solutions by innovating our product offering and improving the experience for our clients and their employees. Helping our clients achieve success is at the core of what we do, so it's critical that we understand the business issues they're facing in the markets they serve. We recently hosted an Insights 2 Innovation forum for a number of our clients to help us look around the corner. These client insights provide a framework to enhance our innovation efforts to ensure we are consistently advancing our solutions to address their needs and help their businesses thrive. To this point, in May we introduced a new program for ADP TotalSource focused on health, wealth, life and work, aiming to provide worksite employees with a suite of benefits and tools designed to support employee growth and development. Increasingly, employees are interested in tools and services to optimize productivity and wellness across the entirety of their lives, both at work and at home. We are continuously looking at ways to improve the health of worksite employees by offering new benefit solutions and partnering with clients to implement wellness programs. We also continue to expand into new markets and grow globally with our clients. In the 104 countries that we now serve, we remain focused on broadening our service capabilities to ensure we are delivering consistent, scalable and valuable services. In fact, the Everest Group recently recognized ADP for the geographic scope, scalability and global expertise of our payroll offerings. The success we've achieved requires that ADP continues to attract and keep great talent. We take great pride in creating an environment that attracts great people and I'm honored by some of the recent awards we've received recognizing ADP as an innovative company and a great place to work. Specifically, InformationWeek recently named ADP to their list of top business technology innovators and Computerworld listed ADP as a Top Place to Work in IT. And we are also pleased to have ranked number 20 on the 2015 DiversityInc Top 50 Companies for Diversity. ADP is the only HCM company that serves clients across the globe, across the full HCM spectrum and across the full range of client sizes. We focus on our clients' biggest investment, challenge and opportunity : their people. And we have the resources, scale and expertise to meet the market needs. Our clients are responding. We now have 500,000 clients in the cloud, more than 5 million people are using our mobile app and client revenue retention remains at record levels. In closing, fiscal 2015 was a successful year for ADP. We sharpened our focus on the HCM market through the spin-off of CDK Global. We expanded our suite of HCM solutions and our global presence and delivered solid revenue growth in spite of pressure from foreign currency translation. Consistent with our commitment to shareholder-friendly actions, we returned $2.5 billion in cash through dividends and share repurchases and during fiscal 2015 reached a milestone of 40 years of consecutive dividend increases. As I look forward into fiscal 2016 and the opportunity we have to assist our clients with growing regulatory compliance associated with the Affordable Care Act, I'm excited about the challenge ahead. The success of our HCM solutions highlights the strength of our direct sales force and our history of assisting clients with navigating the challenges of ever-increasing regulatory complexity. Combine this with ADP's historical strength of expanding client relationships, and this is a challenge I would love to have every year. The higher selling expense we incurred in the fourth quarter is behind us. To deliver on these commitments to clients, we will invest further in the first half of the fiscal year to convert these new sales to recurring revenues. We believe these investments will reward us with profitable revenue growth and even deeper client relationships over the longer term. I am confident that as we successfully execute against our strategy, we will continue to drive results for our clients, our associates and our shareholders. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Jan to further review our fiscal 2015 financials and a discussion of our fiscal 2016 outlook. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you very much, Carlos. And good morning, everyone. As Carlos mentioned, fiscal year 2015 was a successful year for ADP. Revenues grew 7% to $10.9 billion for the year. This growth includes a negative impact of approximately 2 percentage points from the effects of foreign currency translation. Pre-tax earnings grew 10%, which includes a negative impact of approximately 1 percentage point from the effects of foreign currency translation. ADP's consolidated pre-tax margin improved by 60 points for the year. This included a drag of about 20 basis points from the slower growth of our high margin client funds interest revenues as these highly profitable revenues grew at a slower rate than overall revenues. Diluted earnings per share grew 12% to $2.89 on a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. This growth included a negative impact of about $0.04 from the effects of foreign currency translation. And as Carlos mentioned, our new business bookings for the year exceeded our expectations, finishing at 18% growth for the quarter and 13% for the year compared with our April 30 forecast of about 10%. This outperformance resulted in higher selling expense than ADP anticipated and caused pre-tax margins and earnings results to come lower than our own prior expectations. Overall, I'm pleased with ADP's solid performance, which yielded good growth despite the impacts from foreign currency translation and continued low interest rate environment, which puts pressure on the growth of ADP's high margin client fund interest revenues. I'm also pleased that we continued our shareholder-friendly actions, returning approximately $2.5 billion to shareholders during fiscal year 2015 through dividends and share repurchases. So now for a discussion of our segments results. In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 5% for the year and were negatively impacted by 2 percentage points from foreign currency translation. This revenue growth was driven primarily by additions of new recurring revenues across all of our HCM markets we serve. For the fiscal year, client revenue retention remains at a record high level of 91.4%. You have may noticed in this morning's press release that the fourth quarter - that in the fourth quarter our revenue retention rate declined by approximately 30 basis points. And as we told you last quarter, we do experience variability in this metric from quarter to quarter and we continue to pay close attention to retention across all our areas of our business. We are also pleased that same store pays per control in the U.S. remain strong with an increase of 3% for the year. Average client fund balances grew 5% compared with a year ago, including a negative impact of about 1% from foreign currency translation on balances held outside the U.S. The primary drivers of the client fund balance growth were additions from net new business and pays per control, moderated by decreased balances from lower state unemployment tax rates compared with the prior year as employment levels in the U.S. continue to improve. We remain pleased with the overall performance of our international business, which continues to see healthy growth from sales of our multinational solutions. In Europe, the economic situation remains challenging and while we have seen growth in sales from our in-country solutions that are above Europe's overall GDP rate, the growth had been slower than our overall growth. Pre-tax margins in Employer Services \u2013 pre-tax margin in Employer Services was 70 basis points for the year, primarily from scale and productivity and reflects pressure from additional selling expense related to the fourth quarter outperformance in our new business bookings. I'm very pleased with the performance of the PEO in fiscal year 2015. The business posted 17% revenue growth with average worksite employee growth of 14% for this year. And along with this growth, the PEO delivered exceptionally strong margin expansion through sales productivity and operating efficiencies, expanding margins by approximately 110 basis points for the year. Before I take you through our fiscal 2016 outlook, I would like to point out that our client funds investment strategy had a positive year-over-year impact to our fiscal year 2015 revenue and pre-tax earnings for the first time since 2008. The benefit was slight, contributing about $7 million, driven by a balance growth that was offset by slightly lower average yield on the portfolio. However, we are pleased to have turned the corner in fiscal year 2015 after years of earnings pressure resulting from the continued low interest rate environment. So now, I will take you through our updated fiscal 2016 outlook, which excludes the results of a discontinued operations from a small non-HCM related business we sold at the end of the fiscal year. For fiscal year 2016, we are anticipating new business bookings growth of 8% to 10%. We expect this growth to be balanced across our three strategic pillars, with continued favorable performance from the sale of our ADP Health Compliance products. We anticipate total revenue growth of 7% to 9% for the year, including an anticipated negative impact of 1 percentage point to 2 percentage points from unfavorable foreign currency translation. This forecast assumes 5% to 6% revenue growth in the Employer Services segment, including an anticipated drag of approximately 2 percentage points from foreign currency translation and growth in pays per control of 2% to 3%. Revenue growth for the PEO is expected to be 15% to 17%. ADP's pre-tax margin is expected to expand about 50 basis points from 18.9% in fiscal year 2015. This forecast of pre-tax margin expansion is at the low-end of our goal of 50 basis points to 75 basis points of pre-tax margin expansion over the longer term. We're still committed to this goal but we believe the opportunity to assist our clients with ACA compliance will contribute to ADP's strategy of driving higher penetration of our HCM product suite as well as continue revenue growth and profitability. So while we do not expect to achieve more than 50 basis points of pre-tax margin expansion in fiscal year 2016, we believe that the fiscal year 2016 investments we are making will contribute to ADP's growth and achievement of our longer term goals. On a segment level, we anticipate pre-tax margin expansion of about 100 basis points for Employer Services and about 50 basis points of margin expansion in the PEO. Diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 12% to 14% compared with $2.89 in fiscal year 2015, and includes an anticipated negative impact of about 1 percentage points from unfavorable foreign currency translation. This forecast does not contemplate further share buybacks beyond anticipated dilution related to employee benefit plans. Although as communicated at our March 3 Investor Conference, it is clearly our intent to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders, depending on market conditions. Our earnings per share forecast assumes an effective tax rate of 33.7%, compared with the 33.5% in fiscal year 2015. Before I move to the forecast for the client funds extended investment strategy, I want to make a few comments about our expected quarterly growth rates for fiscal year 2016. As mentioned in this morning's press release, we expect that revenue growth in the first and second quarters of the fiscal year will be below our forecasted range of 7% to 9% for the year and above the forecasted range of 7% to 9% for the third and fourth quarters in that fiscal year. This is due to two factors. First, we anticipate that the first and second quarters of the year will experience continued negative pressure from foreign currency translation until we anniversary the strengthening of the U.S. dollar that occurred during fiscal year 2015, assuming no material changes to current foreign exchange rate. Second, as Carlos mentioned, new business bookings sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 will take time to implement and, therefore, anticipate that the most of the incremental revenue from these solutions will not impact recurring revenue until the third fiscal quarter. Because of the investment in operational resources to support these implementations and the anticipated lower revenue growth in the first half of the year, our quarterly earnings forecast assumes flat to slightly positive pre-tax earnings growth in the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2016. As we have mentioned, we believe this investment will yield growth and longer term benefits to ADP, as well as deeper client relationships. So with that, I will take you through our forecast of the client funds extended investment strategy. First, a reminder that the objectives of our investment strategies remain the safety, liquidity, and diversification of our assets. As of June 30, approximately 80% of our fixed income portfolio was invested in AAA and AA rated securities. In a typical year, our strategy results in about 15% to 20% (21:25) of our fixed income investments maturing, and this year, we expect the percentage of maturities will be closer to the higher end of this range. We continue to base the interest rate assumptions in our forecast on the Fed Funds future contracts and the forward yield curve of the three-and-a-half and five year U.S. Government agencies, as we do not believe it is possible to accurately predict future interest rates, the shape of these \u2013 the shape of the yield curve, or the new bond issuance behavior of corporate and other issuers. For fiscal year 2016, we anticipate average client fund balances in the range of $22.5 billion to $22.9 billion, which represents 3% to 5% growth, and includes an anticipated impact of about 1% from foreign currency translation, as almost 12% of our client fund balances anticipated to be outside the U.S. in fiscal year 2016. We anticipate that the yield on the client funds portfolio will remain about flat at 1.7% compared with fiscal year 2015. These factors are expected to result in an increase of $5 million to $15 million to our client funds interest revenue and an increase of up to $10 million to pre-tax earnings from the client funds extended investment strategy, when compared to fiscal year 2015. The detail of this forecast is available in the supplemental slides on our website. And, finally, before I take \u2013 before we take your questions, we're anticipating capital expenditures of $225 million to $250 million in fiscal year 2016. With that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our first question from the line of David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : Thank you. Good morning, Carlos and Jan. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Good morning. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Good morning, David. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : Good morning. How do you think about balancing this well above trend growth in global new business bookings with the expense associated with implementations? And what I'm trying to understand is, if you have the opportunity, let's say, to meaningfully accelerate bookings growth above the historic target levels of 8% to 10%, would you do it in this environment? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, when you think about the way our business model works, and I think we've been saying this probably for multiple decades, it's an incredibly attractive business model because of the retention rates. So, if you're keeping clients 10 years to 12 years on average, and in some cases, with large clients, 20 years, and to spend the sales expense and the implementation expense in the first year to then have that cash flow stream for that long is just adds a tremendous amount of value in what we call lifetime client value. So, we've been saying this, I think, for decades. All of my predecessors have said it that this is really a great problem to have, is to have new business bookings accelerating the way they did this year, and in the last quarter. And, frankly, from a shareholder value creation standpoint, we would love for it to continue. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : Understood. So as a follow up, that said, I'm trying to understand the 8% to 10% growth target for new business bookings given the 13% growth you put out for FY 2015, is that just a conservative outlook or is that realistic? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Well, we were taking bets on how long it would take someone to ask this question and so you get the prize. And the reality is, I think as we said over the last three years or four years, whenever we have the kind of strong finish that we just experienced, we have historically wanted to be cautious because \u2013 and we've had experiences in the past where, due to the way our incentive systems work and other factors in terms of how our sales force behaves, that a very, very strong finish in a fiscal year can sometimes lead to a slower start in the next fiscal year. So, when we looked at that 8% to 10%, if you look at the five years on a compounded basis, we have had actually right around 10% growth. And so we've been in double-digits now for five years and we're definitely coming off of some very strong momentum. And I think the ACA boost that we're getting is certainly welcome. But I think when you look at it over a long period of time, I think we feel like 10% is a very, very strong number and that's at the top end of our range. So somewhere in that middle range of 8% to 10% feels like the right place for us to be planning our year. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : Understood. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Sara R. Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to start by asking about the strength in the fourth quarter new bookings. Are these coming from larger clients? I'm wondering if that's why it's taking about six months for them to start to contribute. Is any coming from Vantage or much coming from Vantage? And are you expecting margins to be in the typical range? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: So to be clear, I'll let maybe Jan add a little bit of color in terms of specific numbers, but the strength was really across the board in all of our segments. And to be clear, it was not only Affordable Care Act related business; it was also in some of our other HCM solutions, including our core strategic platforms. And we just want to remind you also that ACA compliance is a requirement not just for large national account clients, but really effective next year for clients over 50 employees and currently at clients over 100 employees. And so we obviously experience some interest in our HCM products and ACA compliance products in our major accounts, mid-market business as well. So it wasn't contained really to national accounts. And we also frankly experienced strong growth in our multinational products as well, which have nothing to do with ACA. So we really just had good across-the-board sales results. I don't know if, Jan, you want to add? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah, I think one way to think is that ACA is triggering basically a broader HCM demand because the integrated bundle is very compelling to our clients. That's particularly relevant for the mid and up-market. But in addition to your final question is the margin (28:34) expectations for this ACA business and we have no reason to assume it would be any different from our average that we have in ADP. So this will be a good business for us in the long run. Sara R. Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great. And then turning to the fourth quarter. Employer Services revenue growth of 2% was below what we've seen in a while. And I know that FX was an issue and the comparison was particularly tough. But I am wondering if this was a surprise for you. And if so, what led to it? Particularly because you have had strong new bookings for the last couple of quarters. Thank you. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think excluding the FX, it was not a surprise. I think that if you look at again over four quarters to six quarters, there's some variability sometimes in calendar and a few other odds and ends here. But, no, the answer is it is not out of line with what we would have expected based on our bookings and based on our retention rates and all of the kind of other things that go into that mix. Sara R. Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Great. Thanks. Great bookings. I guess just a build-on question. I mean, can you just force-rank for us which markets were stronger than expected on the bookings front? And any change in duration of deals, thinking about how they cycle in? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Having looked at these numbers last night, I'm not sure that I can force-rank it because we really had strength across the entire portfolio, including global. Probably where we have the most variability is in the highest end of the business just because of the lumpiness and the size of those deals. And we did have particularly strong results in our multinational products. But when you look at the broader big business units where we have much bigger numbers and you don't have as much variability, they were all very, very strong and we were very pleased with the results. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Fair enough. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: The second question was around duration. You mean in terms of how long it's taking to close deals? Or... Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Well, yeah, I was actually more thinking about the revenue realization or the bookings conversion and the terms of the deals (31:02) Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: There are two elements obviously as we deal now with a big backlog of implementations that just have to be naturally worked down. And secondly, the reporting requirements kick in really in earnest around the calendar end of the year. So I think the ACA product itself contributes a little bit to the back-endedness of our product. And then just regular work. So I wouldn't just put anything special into this revenue conversion of a half a year, I think it's just like how we're operationally going to implement the business. And then the ACA timing plays a little bit of a role of it, too. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: There are some important milestones that happen on January 1 with regards to reporting around the Affordable Care Act. And so that's six months from now, that happens to be the average guidance that we give in terms of converting new business bookings into revenues. But we just want to make sure that we maybe gave a little bit of color there that if people are wondering like why now and not three years ago, because the Affordable Care Act was passed quite a long time ago. Some of the requirements for ACA have been phased in over time and there happen to be some important reporting requirements that are kicking in January 1. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. That is very, very clear. Makes sense. So, just one quick follow up just on the buyback front, as we expected, it's not in guidance. But has your philosophy changed at all with respect to buybacks, including how you leverage your balance sheet and approach to debt, et cetera? Thanks. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: No, there is absolutely no change in our philosophy. I think it's actually typical that we would not guide to future share buybacks, so this is right in line with how we've ever done. You should not see any change in our attitude towards returning cash to shareholders. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks, Jan. Thanks, Carlos. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Smitti Srethapramote of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley : Thank you. So just another question on bookings. Generally speaking, the acceleration in new bookings that you're seeing, are you just generally seeing the markets that you are competing in growing faster than you were expecting, or do you think you're also taking share from some of your competitors? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think it's probably a little bit of both and it depends on which market. And probably not going to get into those specifics in terms of market by market. But I think it's a combination of both because we have heard anecdotal stories, we obviously don't meet with our competitors to talk about these things, but we have heard anecdotally that the Affordable Care Act compliance requirements, especially the reporting requirements that are kicking in on January 1, are creating a higher-than-normal level of activity in the marketplace in general. But I think when we look at our growth rates across overall ADP and compare them to the growth rate of industry, we believe we are, I think, winning some market share as well. Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley : Got it. And then just a follow up on ADP Marketplace. It sounds like there's a lot of developer interest. Can you remind us whether this is more about giving customer choice for existing modules or whether it's about generating more revenues? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: That's a good debate that we've had I think a fair amount of here internally and I think we are leaning right now in the direction of being more open than not, which means, in some cases, there will be potentially some either perceived or real gaps that clients will be able to fill in through the ADP Marketplace, but we do fully expect this to be monetizable and I think a revenue generator for ADP. But I think as we've said for the last two quarters or three quarters as excited as we are because of the traction we're getting at $12 billion, this is really not going to have a meaningful impact anytime in the near future from a revenue standpoint. Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee of RBC Capital. Your line is now open. Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, guys. Good morning. I guess I'd ask another question about the ACA product. Obviously, that sounds like that's doing really well. How do you \u2013 two-part question. How do you think about how that trend in bookings trend, once we get into calendar 2016, and, theoretically, most companies are using this service, and can this continue to grow or is this more of like a one-time mad dash to get into compliance and then it's hard to keep growing that product? And the second part, as companies come to you looking for this product, are you seeing them take any other products? Or is that driving broader demand as they're thinking through these issues into the other parts of your portfolio? Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: They are, in fact, taking broader sets of our product. And part of that is, just to refresh your memory, I think we've been talking about this for a few years that the Affordable Care Act really requires a core system of record for payroll, requires a good benefits administration system, and a good time and attendance system. I know you've probably heard the stories about the 30 hours requirement for eligibility and some of the other factors that go into complying with ACA. So, really, having a complete HCM bundle and suite is almost a necessity for ACA compliance. Now, some, I think, competitors and, in some cases, we may choose to provide ACA solutions on a standalone basis, just like we do with standalone tax. But, clearly, with the very effective, direct sales force that we have, I think we are using this as an opportunity to really, as much as possible, encourage prospects and existing clients to really broaden their \u2013 what they're taking from us in terms of HCM solutions because it just makes it easier to report and comply with ACA. But it also, frankly, provides a lot of other benefits that we've been talking about for years, in terms of managing their workforce and optimizing their business. So, the answer is yes, when you look at our sales results, our new business bookings results, the ACA products dragged along with them additional modules and bundles, particularly around benefits administration. We anticipate that time and attendance systems will also be something that will be of increasing interest here over the next couple of years, not just because of ACA but because of some of the recent proposals around new requirements for the measurement of overtime. So, I think that this all bodes well for additional penetration of our products and we did see that in the fourth quarter. Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great, and then the follow-up is, is there anything particular about these ACA solutions that's different and would require a significant level of resources \u2013 investment and resources to handle the onboarding? Or is it just that it's a fairly new product and so you didn't have those assets in place? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah, it's a fairly complex compliance solution. And we developed it really with ADP's value proposition on mind, so it goes even further than recording and measurement eligibility. And in particular at the back end, which has a lot of the filing requirements that are due to the IRS and exchange of information with the public exchanges on penalties and rebates and so forth is fairly complex. And so that requires some time. I think the delay in implementation is not specifically caused by the (39:15) of the ACA product implementation, but more by the volume that we have to work through, and to some degree, if clients buy a full suite of HCM services, obviously, that is a complex implementation on its own. So, that combination of it. So, don't think of the ACA product as particularly difficult to implement. It does require implementation resources, but it is more really that working through the backlog and implementing a large number of broader modules in parallel with the ACA that will cause a kind of that time delay that we give you. Also, the revenue disbursements, I'd just like to remind everybody, is also due to that strong FX pressure in the first two quarters and less FX pressure in the second half of the year, so it's a combination of that that helps with the guidance. And even though you didn't ask the question, I just want to make sure I get the information out. In the first quarter, we anticipate FX pressure of approximately 3% and in the second quarter, revenue pressure of FX by approximately 2%. So you can \u2013 then it abides in the second half of the fiscal year. And on NOI, it's a little bit less pressure but kind of in that neighborhood and so you have really a strong component of this revenue guidance is aided also by the FX impact. So I don't want to have this ACA impact to be too overstated in your thinking. Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from S.K. Prasad Borra of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. S.K.Prasad Borra - Goldman Sachs International : Thanks for taking my question. A couple, if I may. Probably first one just on the operational costs. Can you elaborate on the operational costs associated with this new bookings? Is it just primarily going to be on services or are you expecting some investments in product offerings, especially for the up-market segment? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think just in terms of on the fourth quarter, I think we may have said in our comments, and if not, we should clarify that. We fully \u2013 even as of a few months ago, expected to \u2013 our own forecasts were to come in in line with the guidance that we had provided. And so the entire miss in the fourth quarter, if you want to call it a miss, I kind of call it good news, but if you want to call it a miss, was really due to selling expense. So we had approximately $40 million in incremental selling expense, which again as I said, we'll take all day long because that's now behind us. And again, given these lifetime client values, we're going to have these client for a long time. We're going to be collecting revenue and margin for them for a long time to come. So that's all good news. In terms of what we are planning, in terms of additional resources for implementation, as Jan said, this is all due to volume. It's not related to complexity or other issues, which again, just to reiterate, is a good news story. So we were not anticipating 13% bookings growth, otherwise we would have \u2013 and 18% for the quarter, otherwise we would've told you that last quarter. And so that requires us to ramp up some of these implementation resources purely driven by volume. But again it's a good news story because once we get through that expenses well, then we will have the benefit of those revenues for many, many years to come. And so in terms of quantifying those numbers, as Jan said, the first half of the year, it's mainly an FX story, but we do have probably 30 \u2013 around $30 million to $40 million of incremental operating expenses in order to implement all of these \u2013 all of this new \u2013 all of this incrementals. It's incremental on top of what we had already planned for in terms of implementation expense and that adds a little bit of additional pressure in the first half, but the FX is really the main story. S.K.Prasad Borra - Goldman Sachs International : That's great. On the competitive landscape, can you provide any color on the changing dynamics in various segments, up-market, mid-market, the SME market and also the PEO segment? A lot of noise in the market, but want to hear your perspective on your latest offerings and how the competitive there in the market? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I mean, that's a lot of ground to cover. I think the general answer is again as we prepare for these calls and we look at our win/loss ratios and we look at growth rates of new business bookings, not just for ACA but also in our strategic platforms, we feel pretty good about our competitive position. We don't see any major changes in terms of pricing behavior out in the marketplace. We're steadily growing our sales force at the rates that we had planned and I think our productivity gains have exceeded our expectations, which I think are a sign of I think getting reasonably good traction in terms of our \u2013 the products in the marketplace. So we're \u2013 I think we're pleased with our competitive position but we acknowledge also that there is a lot of competition out there. And a number of new entrants and I'm sure there's plenty have also exit. But this is a vibrant, competitive market but we believe that we are doing a pretty effective job when you look at our new bookings results, which is the ultimate measure of whether or not we're winning against the competition or not. S.K.Prasad Borra - Goldman Sachs International : That's very helpful. Thanks, Carlos. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis of Bernstein. Your line is now open. Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, guys. Hey, in the I guess 7% nominal and then 9% constant currency revenue growth from this year, it looked like pays per control came in around 3%. Can you kind of disaggregate the other 6 points of constant currency growth in there? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yes. Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Client growth versus PEO-related revenue growth versus add-on modules into the base? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Sure. I mean, Jan can maybe add a little bit more detail, but I think as we went through in March Investor Conference, pays per control really adds less than 1% to our revenue growth. And we have a couple of other small items that, plus and minus, very, very small impact. The main impact of our revenue growth is the difference between our new business bookings, which then turn into starts, and then our losses. So, we refer to as starts, which is \u2013 the leading indicator of our starts is our new business bookings. And so that really is the bulk of the 6% that you're referring to. And, by the way, that 6% was probably closer to 2% to 3% three years ago, because as the difference between our starts related to new business bookings and our losses has grown at a faster rate than our revenue growth, we've been able to kind of accelerate our revenue growth here. And that is with kind of a very similar pays per control number overall three or four of those years. And we've had around 2.5% to 3% pays per control growth here for a while. I want to add, also, that for two years or three years, we had about a 1% drag from client funds interest, because that was a revenue number that was under pressure. We had one year where we had $90 million decrease in interest income and in another one, I think we had $50 million. So there are some moving parts where it's very, very hard in a call like this to get through every year, every detail. But, in general, our net new business \u2013 difference between starts and losses has been expanding and growing, and it will continue to, given these strong new business bookings we just reported, and that tends to accelerate our revenue growth. Now, versus other business models that are not recurring revenue models, our revenue growth tends to accelerate at a slower rate because of just the dynamics of the existing base, which we also love. So, we love retaining 91% of our clients. But what that means is that to accelerate that revenue growth requires multiple years of new business bookings growth in 10% or more, which is exactly what we've accomplished in the last five years. And so that's why you've seen this, I think it was probably around 2% coming from that net new business number four years or five years ago, to today more like 6% to 7%. And obviously, we think that by the second half of this fiscal year 2016, that revenue growth rate will be based on \u2013 to be fully \u2013 we were transparent in terms of providing the comments and the guidance that Jan gave, that we expect to be above our range in the second half of the year. I think that you can extrapolate from that that we will have robust revenue growth in the second half, exiting the second half of 2016 and hopefully entering into 2017. Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Terrific. And the just \u2013 sorry, go ahead. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I was going to \u2013 I think your other question was about decomposing PEO impact versus (48:25) impact. And I believe that from a growth rate decomposition standpoint, I believe it's about half and half. Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Got it, got it. Good, and then just one follow-up related to the competitive environment. How frequently are you the only \u2013 are you sole sourced, currently, like, in this most recent quarter, when you had really strong new bookings. Is it predominantly sole sourced? Or are they - Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Sole sourced you're defining as we're in a non-competitive situation basically? Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Exactly, yes. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: We don't really have reliable statistics on it. And it switches, obviously, from \u2013 in the down market, more often than not, it is not a direct competitive situation, to up-market, it's always a competitive situation and a band in between. So, it switches to it. In the cross-selling of our additional modules and ACA products, it's more often than not, probably, that we ask our clients to expand our product offering. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I mean, this is a good opportunity, also, to put in a plug for our direct sales force. We have over 5,000 field salespeople. And I think that that, at various times, becomes a point of discussion externally and internally about the cost of that, because it's an investment. But obviously, this quarter and this year proved that, whether it's a competitive situation or not a competitive situation, having a sales force is an incredibly important competitive weapon for us that, again, we've been utilizing very effectively here for decades and it's a very well-honed machine. And they did an amazing job this year. And I think, as Jan said, other than for small clients, where sometimes there's no competition, but even then there are many options nowadays, almost every situation is competitive. In the mid-market, the up-market and many times in the low end of the market, in the PEO and benefits, and across all of our products, and having a well-trained, well-incented direct sales force is an important competitive advantage for us. Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Terrific. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim MacDonald of First Analysis. Your line is now open. James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Good morning, guys. I'd like to go back to the ACA product. Could you tell us how you're pricing it? Is it priced monthly? Is there an extra charge in January for the form that needs to be filled out, like a W-2? And how big is the market? I mean, how much is this adding to the market in terms of maybe dollars per worksite employee per year? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Good question. This is priced as a module, like our other HCM modules as a per-employee per month-type charge. For ACA compliance, you have to really work throughout the year and so the service is offered throughout the year. And the year-end filing requirements of the forms for the employee and the employer is included in that monthly charge. So once we are going, you should expect a steady recurring revenue stream integrated in our HCM solution. So, it's not like a W-2, for example. It's just an integrated price that we give to our clients. And I'm sorry, the second part of the question was how big it is? It's a smaller-type module compared to our overall incremental revenue that we sell. James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Okay. And maybe for a follow up. Normally, this time of the year, you tell us what your client count was at year end and client growth? I didn't see it in the release. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Jason, you're asking two good questions that we were waiting for and I appreciate them. We had another good year of client count growth accelerating and taking market share of 3.5% for the company. James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corp.: Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Ryan Allen Cary - Jefferies LLC : Hi, guys. This is Ryan Cary calling in for Jason. First one just on the Employer Services side. I saw that the pre-tax margin is expected to be up 100 basis points and then looking at the PEO, which is expected to be up about 50 basis points, but overall pre-tax margins were only forecast to increase 50 basis points. So I was just curious what are the other pieces here? Is there something that maybe I'm missing? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: No, I think we have still a little bit of \u2013 number one, it's the balance of the growth. So you have 50 basis points of the PEO which weighs down the overall margin expansion and you have a very small drag from the client fund interest rate that depresses anything, but nothing else really that is that meaningful. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: And if you remember that the way that we do our reporting is we provide Employer Services a 4.5%, which, again, this has been going on for years that we just fixed it at 4.5%. They get credit for the fund balances at 4.5% in Employer Services. And then we have in the other segment is where we do kind of the adjustment, if you will, for what the real rates are, which, as we just, said are 1.7%. So that accounts for some of that difference as well. The missing link for you in terms of it's 150 basis points and then that other segment, at least today and into the foreseeable future, will be a drag on that overall margin just because of the math, because of the way we credit interest at 4.5%. So there's no economic difference to ADP overall. It's just that we, for management purposes so that Employer Services isn't focused on interest rates, we pass back to them a credit for interest rates at 4.5%. And that number, one would argue now with the benefit of hindsight that that number's too high. But it's been that way for many, many years. And for comparability purposes, we've chosen to just leave it the same. Ryan Allen Cary - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks so much. And then on client retention, I saw it's down a little bit year-over-year for the second straight quarter, but it was flat at record levels for the full year. Can you just tell us what you're assuming for 2016 in regards to client retention? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: We don't really guide to our client retention. But we have historically said that maintaining historic levels of retention is for sure a good goal to have. Ryan Allen Cary - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good morning. I'll just follow up on the retention. Obviously, two quarters isn't a trend, but we haven't seen two quarters consecutively down. Is there anything to call out there or maybe perhaps a lost client from a couple quarters that continues to drag? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think if you go back you \u2013 not that I'm trying to encourage you to look for bad news, but you will find that we definitely have had prior times in our history where we had two consecutive quarters of decline in retention. It's just the way \u2013 mathematically, it has to have happened just because of the fluctuations that we've had over the years in our client retention. But the answer is, you see the tone of how seriously we take this. And we've said twice that we watch this very, very carefully and we're looking across all of our segments. Unfortunately, we just really don't have anything to report in terms of any patterns or any particular place of concern that we have right now. And we will definitely communicate that if we see any of that. I did, as I prepared for the earnings call, notice that in our major accounts and our mid-market business, as we got off or in the process of getting off of two of our legacy platforms, we did have retention pressure on those platforms. And that doesn't account for the 30 basis point decline, but as we move from our small business migrations or upgrades where we move clients over onto RUN, where we had just frankly amazing results, where retention actually has improved and increased overall through those migrations. As we anticipated as we began this process of trying to accelerate the upgrades of our clients in our mid-market and up-market, I think it's safe to say that when we get to the end of the line on some of these platforms, that we do experience a little bit of pressure. So we had a time and attendance system, for example, in our mid-market where we spent a couple of years getting all of the clients off of it. And then in the last six months, the last few hundred clients the retention rate was 50%. So good news is it was only a couple of hundred clients and so that 50% retention rate doesn't really have a major impact on overall ADP in terms of revenues or retention. But you combine that with another legacy payroll platform where we only have I believe now it's 300 clients left on our PCPW platform in our mid-market, that also experienced lower than historical retention rates as we get to the end of the line in terms of encouraging the last few clients to move off of that platform and to upgrade them. Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then back to the bookings growth, the 18% in the quarter, I know there's been a lot of discussion regarding it, but I guess I'm a little still unclear what the upside was on the quarter. Was it specific to the ACA products? But it sounds to me like that's not a huge driver. Or was it just sort of broad based strength across the board that kind of surprised you to the upside? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: It was broad based strength across the board, but ACA was a significant part of it. Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And just, Jan, to clarify, the $40 million incremental sales commission, by my math, that's like $0.05 or $0.06 for the quarter. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think that's fair. And so we had a little bit better performance and a few miscellaneous items, so we would have point landed (58:36) our 14% earnings growth without (58:39). Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. What was the expectation for new bookings? I knew it grew 18%, but I know it was over your expectation. But what was it going into the fourth quarter? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: We had guided for 10% new business bookings growth on our last earnings call and so our true expectation was to grow 10% for the year and I'm looking at new business bookings for... Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Our sales plan had to be below... Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I don't have \u2013 it had to be below 10% because we exited around 11% year-to-date in third quarter. So we had planned slightly below 10% new business bookings growth. That is almost little bit too much detail here for our purposes, but 10% was our true forecast at the end of the forecast for the year. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, yeah, because I don't recall in ADP's history missing EPS due to selling expense. So I guess it sounds like the size of the direct sales force has increased as well? Maybe that has something to do with it, or just maybe the comp structure? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I contribute that to your young age, but we do had... Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: ADP has missed... Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: We have missed the number of times actually due to good sales performance actually I think in my first year, three years ago, we did have such year also. So it does happen and as Carlos has alluded to, we have two things there, sales incentives that accumulate and accelerate performance in a good sales year for the sales force, so they have high incentives to book. And that causes it. And if you multiply out that incremental new business bookings relative to the NSE cost, (01:00:49) you see, really, that it's just a marginal cost that we pay out and have in our distribution channel. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Hey. Just because of the nature of our business model, really, the only \u2013 not the only, but one of the few places where we get variability in terms of our results is on bookings and sales expense. But, the good news is that having additional selling expense is usually related to having really great bookings result, which is what we had. And, as I said, like, when you look at our business model, that's a great \u2013 it's a great story and a great outcome. So \u2013 but it is the one place where \u2013 we don't, as you can imagine, you can just imagine how silly it would be for us to call our sales force in the middle of the quarter and tell them we would like you to stop selling, so that we don't miss our sales expense forecast. That's not what we do. We actually call them and go on sales calls to encourage them to close as much business as possible, because of what it does to the lifetime value of ADP. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: No. Yeah, that makes sense. I mean, it doesn't make sense to not grow the business. It just doesn't happen that often. But then again, I guess an 18% bookings quarter obviously in the fourth quarter is \u2013 doesn't happen as often, historically. All right, just last question for me. I think you mentioned this, Carlos, but obviously, with the low revenue and profit in the first half of fiscal year 2016, and then an accelerated growth rate in the back half of fiscal year 2016, that I think we can assume, or should we assume then the first half of fiscal year 2017 will still have those benefits? So, we should have an outsized growth rate in both profit and revenue in the first half of fiscal year 2017 as well? Thanks so much. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Let me just answer your original question, which was back to \u2013 I did find some of these numbers here. So, the 18% in Q4 of 2015 was 110% of plan. So, you can assume that our growth rate expectation was around 7% or 8% for the fourth quarter. And we had 18%. And another piece of information is in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, we had 4% growth. So just to give you a sense of kind of the grow over issue there. And on the last question, we're not providing fiscal year 2017 guidance yet. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Yeah, I just thought you mentioned something about that it will continue into fiscal year 2017 because of that growth rate that's in the second half, which will be exponentially higher. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Well, I didn't say anything about \u2013 I think what I said was that we would be exiting \u2013 and I did get kicked under the table, by the way, for what I said. But what I said is that it's clear from what Jan said in his comments that we expect to have the second half of the year revenue growth to be above the guidance range and the first half to be below the guidance range. That would lead most people to conclude that, assuming the FX doesn't compress even more than it has, because, again, this assumes that we plan based on spot rates at the time that we're having this call, or at the time we actually prepare our operating plans. So, things can happen. That's why we don't provide fiscal year 2017 guidance. But, assuming the FX rates stay where they are and at the pressure abates in the second half and that we have all of these new business bookings implemented and executed upon, then I think what we said was that, in the second half of the year, we would be above our guidance range. And then, for folks who follow ADP closely, they know that just because of the recurring revenue nature of the business, that if in the fourth quarter of a fiscal year, you have X revenue growth, that again, barring any changes in FX or other things, that, for the following first or second quarters of the next fiscal year, you should be somewhere in the same neighborhood. This is not trying to provide guidance. We're just trying to help, I guess, clarify what I think is already \u2013 should be obvious. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Super. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber of BMO. Your line is now open. Henry Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey, good morning. It's Henry Chien calling in for Jeff. Just wanted to follow up a little bit about pricing. Could you talk a little bit about pricing trends you're seeing and how much, if any, that pricing was used to generate some of that new business bookings growth? Thanks. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah. Two components to your pricing question. In the past fiscal year, we had price increases approximated a little bit less than 1% of revenue growth, right in line with our long-term expectations. And when \u2013 the best way to assess pricing competitiveness and pricing dynamics on the new business bookings is really a way to look at our discounting levels throughout the book of business as we sell and they are consistent with prior quarters, so we have not seen any changes in our \u2013 in the pricing environment that were meaningful to report. Henry Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got it. Okay. Perfect, thank you. And just wanted to touch a little bit on the partnership with Cornerstone OnDemand. How are you thinking about \u2013 or if you have any updates on your thoughts on where it makes more sense to partner on certain areas of HR? Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think we offered a couple of examples out of the set of 60 participants in the marketplace, picking a couple very well-known partners and market participants in the HCM market, just as examples that we have really \u2013 you shouldn't read more into it. We have larger and established companies in the marketplace and we have startups in the company place and we're really emphasizing the need to be part of an overall integrated environment that the utilization of this APIs will allow us to pursue, to better serve our clients. Henry Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got it. Okay. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. And again, ladies and gentlemen, in order to allow time for others, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Foresi of Janney Montgomery. Your line is now open. Robert E. Simmons - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Hi. Great. Thanks. This is Robert Simmons on for Joe. So you called out that FX hit Employer Services by 4%. Can you say how much it hit the PEO line? And then how do each of those compare to your expectations? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: That's a good question. The PEO has no FX impact. They're a U.S. only business. So, yes. Robert E. Simmons - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : And then, relative to expectations, were they 4% on FX for Employer Services? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: For Employer Services, it's kind of in line with what I gave you for the overall company. It's a little bit... Sara Grilliot - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Sorry. You're asking... Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: It's a little bit more \u2013 I'm sorry, I misunderstood. So, the ES revenue \u2013 why not, it's a mathematic. It's about 4% in the first quarter for ES, and between 2% to 3% in the second quarter for next year. Robert E. Simmons - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Sorry. I was asking, though, what actually happened in the fourth quarter compared to what you thought was going to happen, in terms of FX impact. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Oh, it was right in line. I'm sorry. I misunderstood. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: In line with 4%. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah, it was 4% and... Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Just to be clear, it's 4%. Because it is greater than the overall ADP impact, because the PEO has none, and it's $2.5 billion of revenue. So, I think, by definition, the ES impact has to be a larger percent impact than the overall ADP impact. Robert E. Simmons - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Definitely. Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon of Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Good morning. Post the new sales that you had, what percentage of the client base that is required to file 1095s has actually signed up for the ACA compliance product? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I don't think we want to talk about it in detailed numbers, but your question, Mark, yields on are we anticipating future ACA sales in future years and the answer is yes, so it's not everybody has signed up. We still have opportunity in future years. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): It would be significant, wouldn't it? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah, it would. Yes, we have a large portion of our clients signed up, but not all. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then with regards to nationals. What percentage of the clients are on Vantage at this point versus some of the older systems? And what's the plan in terms of the transition? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: So Jan will probably get you the \u2013 we can come up with \u2013 I think I have it here somewhere in terms of how many clients we have live on Vantage. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: 129 clients live. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I knew he had the numbers, so 129 live on Vantage. We did this year go through some migrations and so we have been \u2013 I guess, I would call it dabbling and working on some migration tools and moving some clients, but we have several thousand clients in our national accounts base so \u2013 and frankly we kind of like \u2013 we want to do both but we really like new share and incremental growth to the company, and so our focus for the last couple of years has been on kind of new logos, new share, but we realized that we also need to bring our existing clients along, just like we're saying we need to do that in the mid-market and then in the low end of the market. So I think you'll continue to see us do both, sell new share and also migrate clients \u2013 sorry, upgrade. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And just from a servicing perspective, is there any changes contemplated in terms of the service methodology going forward in any of the lines to even further strengthen the retention rate? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah, we have a number of initiatives on continually enhancing our service and compliance offerings which are, as you know, an important part of the overall ADP value proposition. So, in addition to the technology of Vantage and Workforce Now on RUN, very important and so they are ongoing and incremental and they, in particular, focused on improving the overall client experience by offering a more integrated service offering that further strengthens like the togetherness of payroll, HR, talent and benefit. So that the client gets really the best of ADP from an integrated source of service. So it's an ongoing transition as we work on continually improve it. But in parallel with us becoming an integrated HCM technology platform provider, our services will \u2013 is migrating into that same method. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: And we've I think invested more than the normal amount in user experience and usability over the last 12 months, and I think it's \u2013 it's I think getting us good traction in the marketplace because that is frankly, in today's world, the expectation is to have kind of a consumer grade experience both for the worksite employees or the employees of our clients and the worksite employees in the PEO as well as for the practitioners that use our products at the client site. And so, if you do market checks, you'll see that we have an updated \u2013 and we mentioned it in some of our comments, so I think that we've been investing quite a bit in usability and user experience. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. And one last question. What's the remaining authorization on the buyback? Sara Grilliot - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I can get that for you, Mark. I can follow up with you. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Enough for now. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Enough for a good bit. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: You don't have to worry about it, but we're going to get that for you. Sara Grilliot - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Neill of Autonomous Research. Your line is now open. Matt C. O'Neill - Autonomous Research US LP : Hey. Good morning. I was just curious if you, guys, could go back and discuss the DataCloud offering that you mentioned you now have 1,000 clients signed up for and maybe how the revenue model works for that business and if it's nice to have or a must have for the clients who have kind of given you feedback on it at this point? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I'm glad you're asking. So, DataCloud is the branded name for our data analytics and Big Data product that we're developing and it is our new market-leading comprehensive reporting and analytic solution that includes benchmarking and capabilities for it and it's sold in our mid-market as an incremental module, reporting \u2013 or analytics module, if you want, it's called DataCloud and you subscribe to it on a per employee per month basis. And it just launched and we have 1,000 clients mostly in the mid-market. Vantage has it built in and it's included and we're seeing good traction I think. This is going to \u2013 from my personal expectation, it should be a must have because it is truly unique the way you can now drill in and compare your performance to a level of detail of compare to benchmarks it's really not available elsewhere, and so we put big investments into our data analytics product development and DataCloud is really the first version of it and you should see continued expansion and broadening of the offering. So very exciting early stages and I think you will hear more from it over the next year for sure. Matt C. O'Neill - Autonomous Research US LP : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the call over to Mr. Carlos Rodriguez for any closing remarks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you all for joining us today. I think that the 2015 results as you see I think are an example of the enduring quality of the ADP business model as we continue to combine best in class sales operation with breakthrough products and services to try to meet the needs of our clients. I also want to take this opportunity to say that as excited as we are about the opportunities in front of us, we need to thank our associates and, in particular, our sales implementation associates for the hard work in 2015. There was a lot of extra hard work to make these new bookings results happen and there's still a lot of work in front of us here in 2016 and it would appear beyond in order to get all of this business implemented, started and provide the clients the service they expect from us. So I appreciate their hard work as well, and I look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. That does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP\u2019s First Quarter Fiscal 2016 Earnings Webcast. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Ms. Sara Grilliot, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Sara Grilliot : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. This is Sara Grilliot, ADP\u2019s Vice President, Investor Relations, and I am here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer and Jan Siegmund, ADP\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call and webcast. Before we begin, you may have noticed in this morning\u2019s earnings release that we are now including a condensed statement of cash flows to assist you in updating your models ahead of our quarterly 10-Q filing. We will also discuss certain growth measures on a constant dollar basis, which adjusts for the impact of foreign currency. You will see similar comparisons in this morning\u2019s earnings release and in our SEC filings. In addition with the introduction of long-term debt to our capital structure during the quarter, we are moving away from a discussion of pre-tax earnings and pre-tax margin and will instead discuss earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT and EBIT margins. We believe this change best reflects the operating performance of our business. For ADP, EBIT includes interest income and expense associated with our client funds extended investment strategy, but excludes all other interest income and expense incurred such as interest income earned on corporate funds outside of the client fund strategy and interest expense incurred on long-term debt. Since the client funds extended investment strategy is a fundamental operating component of our business, we believe this approach best measures our operating performance. During our call today, we will reference these and certain other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. To begin our call today, Carlos will start with some opening remarks and then you Jan will take you through the quarter\u2019s results and an update on what to expect for fiscal 2016. I would like to remind everyone that today\u2019s call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. With that, I will turn the call over to Carlos. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you, Sara and good morning everyone. This morning, we reported our fiscal quarter \u2013 first fiscal quarter 2016 results with revenue up 6% or 9%, excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation. In addition to the solid revenue growth, we also continued to report very strong new business bookings performance, which grew 13% in the quarter. We are off to a good start. And as a result, we now anticipate full year new business bookings growth to be up at least 10% compared with our prior forecasted range of 8% to 10% growth. We have solid momentum as we delivered client-driven innovation that leverages our scale and deep HCM expertise to win in a competitive industry. Our ability to meet a wide range of client needs with leading solutions is unique in the industry and gets stronger everyday. I would like to give you a few examples. Last quarter, we told you about our introduction of ADP DataCloud, which leverages ADP\u2019s unparalleled data to deliver workforce analytics that help boost productivity, develop talent, increase retention and identify potential flight risk. More than 1,200 ADP clients are already taking advantage of these analytical capabilities. Earlier this month, we reduced benchmarking capability to the DataCloud analytics platform. This new benchmarking solution provides users with unique insight from real and optimized up-to-date data. With many companies experiencing a word for talent, this new tool will provide HR teams with key industry workforce metrics for quickly identifying changing market trends. We believe that access to the right information at the right time will help companies create successful, engaging work environments. You have heard us talk about the breadth of our portfolio in terms of serving clients and their employees from hire to retire. On the front end of that continuum, I am proud to share that Forrester Research recently named ADP a leader among talent acquisition vendors that help clients proactively search for, find and nurture job candidates. And for those new employees hired by our clients, we just introduced a new on-boarding solution that harnesses human resource data to personalize the on-boarding process. We are really excited about this new product as on-boarding is often characterized by mountains of paperwork and a lack of understanding about an employee\u2019s new role, team and culture. This new on-boarding solution, a product of our Innovation Labs, delivers a simple, enjoyable on-boarding experience that helps get new hires positioned for success before their first day on the job and it\u2019s another example of how ADP is innovating across the HCM spectrum. Let me turn now to the Affordable Care Act. ADP has decades of experience in helping clients of all sizes, meet the challenge of new compliance requirements. Since the ACA was enacted in 2010, our approach has been no different. Our Health Compliance solutions have been particularly well received in the market and their adoption has outpaced our internal expectations. But while we are excited about the business opportunities, ACA has created for ADP let me be clear this is not easy work. We have added significantly to our implementation organization to address the demand and we have teams working around-the-clock to get our clients live on our ACA solutions. We are pleased with the progress we have made and proud of the many associates who are showing extraordinary dedication to help clients navigate these uncharted waters. The high demands on our implementation and service organizations will continue and I am confident that ADP is able to deliver on our client commitments. To deliver on these commitments, we told you that we will continue to invest in our business to convert these new sales to recurring revenues. We are confident these investments will reward us with profitable revenue growth and even deeper client relationships over the long-term. Another way we are helping clients manage the cost of compliance of healthcare reform is through our new ADP private exchange offering, which we introduced in August. ADP\u2019s flexible private exchange enables employers to build and implement a healthcare insurance exchange strategy that can help control cost and engage their employees. The solution delivers an end-to-end exchange experience for the employer, including an engaging retail-oriented shopping experience, defined contribution plan administration, public exchange enrollment, ACA compliance, and spending accounts. All of this is integrated with and powered by our broader set of HCM solutions. Once again, we have brought our technology and expertise together in a way that\u2019s meeting an acute client need at a time when businesses are raising to adapt to changing regulation. Separately, I am proud to share that our ADP Marketplace won two prestigious designations from Human Resource Executive Magazine including Top HR Product of the Year and Awesome New Technology. We were excited to have received these recognitions at HR Tech in Las Vegas last week as they provide some nice validation for our client-centric view of enhancing HCM capabilities. We are excited about the potential for this platform to make it easy for clients to extend the value of their investments in ADP\u2019s HCM solutions while helping us strengthen client relationships. Innovation is a job that\u2019s never done and we are proud of our progress. Before I turn it over to Jan for a discussion about the quarter\u2019s results, there are a couple of things that I would like to mention. First, during the quarter, we executed on our strategy to enhance our capital structure through the issuance of $2 billion in senior notes, which are intended to fund incremental purchases of shares over the next 12 to 24-month time period. This action is consistent with our communication at our March Investor Conference when we acknowledged our leverage capacity available within our AA credit ratings category and our intention to be thoughtful in our approach to changing our capital structure. These actions, the debt issuance and the share repurchases, are intended to enhance total shareholder return over the long-term. Second, I would like to take a minute to talk about client retention. Our client retention has been at ever increasing historical highs for the last several years, leveling out at 91.4% over the last two fiscal years. This is a very solid performance that we have been very proud of, so we are naturally disappointed to see a decline of 160 basis points in the first quarter. We take client retention very seriously and are highly focused on this key metric. Some client losses were anticipated of course, given the anticipated churn that comes with moving clients from legacy platforms to our new cloud based solutions. However, we were disappointed to see an elevated level of losses from clients on mature technology. In addition, there is a lot of activity in the marketplace right now as clients choose providers to help them comply with ACA. Clearly, we have experienced benefits from that activity through higher new business bookings, but the increased level of implementation activity of ACA solutions combined with the movements of clients to new platforms, has put higher demands on our service organization. We know we have opportunities to enhance the client experience to ensure our customers recognize the value of great software and services that ADP delivers. And my team is squarely focused on these opportunities. And I have full confidence, given our track record and our team\u2019s ability to execute. We are off to a good start, but we have a lot of work ahead of us in fiscal 2016. The challenges of ACA compliance have impacted our clients and are causing some disruption both in the market and within ADP as we sell and implement these new solutions and also prepare to answer the many calls and increase we expect to receive from our clients in the coming months. We have increased our forecast for new business bookings and along with that comes increased cost not only in the form of selling expenses but also in operational resources to install and support this new business. As a result, we are now expecting to be at the bottom end of our forecasted range of 12% to 14% for earnings per share growth. So as I said, we have a lot of work in front of us and likely some challenges ahead, which may require some further investments. But I firmly believe that as we successfully execute against our strategy, we will continue to drive long-term results for our clients, our associates and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call over to Jan for a further review of the first quarter results. Jan Siegmund : Thank you very much, Carlos and good morning everyone. Before I begin, during the quarter, we sold our AdvancedMD business and realized a gain of $29 million. The results of this business, which historically were reported in the Employer Services segment are not reported as discontinued operation and have been moved to the other segment for comparative purposes both in the current period and all prior periods presented. The restated segment amounts can be found in the supplemental schedules on our Investor Relations website. My comments on the quarter\u2019s results and our fiscal year 2016 outlook exclude the impact of the $29 million gain on the sale of this business. ADP revenues grew 6% in the quarter or 9% on a constant dollar basis. Earnings before tax \u2013 interest and taxes or EBIT grew 6% or 8% on a constant dollar basis. This growth is inclusive of investments we have made during the quarter to increase operational resources in support of product implementations. EBIT margin increased about 10 basis points compared to 17.5% in last year\u2019s first quarter. Diluted earnings per share grew 10% to $0.68 or 11% on a constant dollar basis and benefited from a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. And as Carlos mentioned, our new business bookings started strong for the quarter with 13% growth. Overall, our results in the quarter were good, yielding solid revenue growth despite continued headwind from foreign currency translation. And as anticipated, earnings growth was slower in the quarter due to expected investments in the resources to implement HCM solutions that will add to our future recurring revenue growth. In our employer segment \u2013 in our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 3% in the quarter or 7% on a constant dollar basis. As Carlos discussed, client revenue retention decreased 160 basis points for the quarter from elevated losses in legacy client platforms. Our same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.3% in the first quarter. This is slower growth than we have seen in the past several quarters. However, we still expect to see 2% to 3% growth in this metric for this year. Remember that one point of growth in pays per control contributes about $20 million in total revenue to ADP. Average client fund balances grew 3% compared to a year ago or 6% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was driven by additions of net new business and increased wage levels compared to the prior year\u2019s first quarter. Outside U.S., we continue to see solid revenue growth and margin growth driven largely by the success of our multinational solutions, which continued to perform well. Employer Services margin declined about 50 basis points in the quarter. The decline is largely in line with our expectation and reflects increased selling expenses and investment and implementation resources to install and support ADP Health Compliance solutions. The PEO continues its track record on solid performance, posting 18% revenue growth in the quarter. Average worksite employees grew 13% to 389,000. A portion of the 18% revenue growth was driven by increased benefit costs and higher benefit plan participation from our worksite employees during the quarter. We believe this gap has \u2013 between revenue growth and worksite employer growth, which have consistently ranged between two and three points per quarter will return to normalized levels for the balance of the year. Along with this revenue growth, the PEO delivered margin expansion through lower selling expenses and operating efficiencies, expanding margins by approximately 130 basis points in the quarter. Both of our segments performed well in the quarter and as Carlos mentioned, we are off to a good start, but we also have some opportunities and challenges ahead. As a result, we have revised certain aspects of our full year fiscal year 2016 outlook. First, as Carlos mentioned to reflect the strong start we had in new business bookings, we now expect bookings growth of at least 10% compared with our prior forecast of 8% to 10%. With the divestiture of the AdvancedMD business, which was included for the full year in fiscal year 2015, but only two months of fiscal year 2016, we have reduced our revenue expectations for the year almost one percentage point. As a result, we are now forecasting revenue growth of 7% to 8% compared with our prior forecast of 7% to 9%. And just as a reminder, because of continued negative pressure expected from foreign currency translation as well as timing of recurring revenue starts from new business bookings sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, revenue growth is expected to be below the guidance range in the second quarter and above the guidance range for the third and fourth quarter. On a constant dollar basis, our total revenue growth is anticipated to be 8% to 9%. Our revenue growth forecast for the Employer Services and PEO remains unchanged. However, I would like to remind you that we anticipate two points of negative impact to Employer Services revenue growth in the second quarter from foreign currency translation and about two percentage points for the full fiscal year. Consistent with our new approach of discussing EBIT margin expansion compared with our prior practice of discussing pretax margin expansion, we will now be providing a forecast for EBIT margin expansion. For fiscal year 2016, consistent with our prior forecast of 50 basis points of pretax margin expansion, we anticipate adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 50 basis points from 18.8% in fiscal year 2015. Our segment margin expansion forecasts for the year are unchanged. For the client funds extended investment strategy, we have lowered our forecast due to revised market expectations, which now assume a delayed increase in the Fed funds rate as well as lower fixed income new purchase rates compared with our prior forecast. We are now anticipating that client funds interest revenue will increase up to $5 million compared with our prior forecast of an increase of $5 million to $15 million. The total contribution from the client fund extended investment strategy is now expected to be about flat to last year compared to our prior forecast of an increase of up to $10 million. The details of this forecast are available in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. For the fiscal year, while we still expect growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share of 12% to 14% compared to the $2.89 in fiscal year 2015, we now expect this growth to be at the lower end of the range. On a constant dollar basis, our adjusted diluted earnings per share growth is expected to be 13% to 15%. This forecast includes $43 million of additional net interest expense anticipated from the $2 billion in senior notes issued during September as well as the expected impact of share repurchases in fiscal year 2016, which I assumed to be completed ratably over the next 24 months. Together, these items are not anticipated to have a material impact on our diluted earnings per share for the year. The forecast does not contemplate further share buybacks beyond anticipated future dilution related to employee benefit plans, although it is our intention to return excess cash to shareholders depending on market conditions. And as Carlos mentioned, we have a lot of work in front of us, particularly in the second quarter as we install new solutions and prepare to support our clients in their efforts to comply with ACA. We have on-boarded more than 500 associates in the first quarter and engaged third-parties to assist with our implementation efforts, but the majority of this expense will ramp in the second quarter. This investment combined with lower anticipated revenue growth continuing into the second quarter from the effects of foreign currency is expected to result in EBIT that is flat compared to last year\u2019s second quarter. We believe the adjustments we have made to our fiscal year 2016 forecast reflect the challenges and opportunities that we have in front of us, but we also acknowledge that changing factors such as higher than anticipated new business bookings or higher client call volumes related to ACA could put a short-term strain on our earnings growth. There are many factors at play in the market and with our clients, which could cause risk in achieving our full year earnings forecast. However, we believe that delivering on commitments to our clients and focusing on our strategy will yield the best long-term results for ADP. So, with that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from the line of David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Anthony Cyganovich : Hi, this is Anthony Cyganovich on for David. How do you think about balancing the above trend growth in global new business bookings with the expense associated with implementation? Jan Siegmund : I am sorry, the question is related to global \u2013 you mean to bookings outside of the U.S.? Anthony Cyganovich : No, overall bookings. Jan Siegmund : Yes, I mean, I think we have, I think for decades we have always taken the position that we will take as much business as we can get from a bookings standpoint. So, when you look at the lifetime value and the discounted \u2013 the present value of discounted cash flows of our clients given our retention rates, especially in the mid-market and the up-market, we basically have to take all the business we can. So, we have always been willing to sacrifice short-term profitability in the form of additional implementation and service expense in order to add additional \u2013 and implement new additional bookings and raise our revenue growth. And that\u2019s really what has been happening over the last three or four years, so that we clearly have had greater tailwinds in the last few quarters than we have seen for a while. But just want to remind everyone, we have had double-digit sales growth on a compounded basis here now for four years and that\u2019s what\u2019s really helped create this \u2013 in our world, accelerating revenue growth, which is in 0.5 point to 1 point increments at a time per year. So, our revenue growth is kind of slowly inched up and when you look at it on a constant dollar basis, 9% growth through the quarter. And we believe that in the second half of the year we might be higher than that, because our guidance is very clear that we expect to be above the guidance range. Those are pretty strong revenue growth numbers for ADP and it\u2019s driven by new business bookings that we have been able to generate over all these years and now we are in a situation where we have even stronger new business bookings and we are going to continue to do the same thing, which is we are going to take it all and we are going to implement it all. Anthony Cyganovich : Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. Just a follow-up, can you talk about the pipeline of new products you intend to introduce in Employer Services and PEO over the next 1 to 3 years? Carlos Rodriguez : This probably is not the best forum to do that. From a competitive standpoint, I think we have \u2013 the things that I talked about in my introductory statements, I think probably give you a sense of kind of some of the direction that we are headed in which is really providing a lot more insight through data analytics for our clients in order to help them run their businesses better, hire the right people, retain the people, pay them the right amounts and there is all very, very powerful insights that can be gleaned from the data that ADP has. And I think we have known that this is a competitive advantage for us and a differentiator. And we spent the last two or three years really building, I think the products and I think DataCloud and some of the analytics that we are building on that platform, I think are going to provide those types of tools for our clients. So, we are working on a few other things that we are really not ready to talk about just yet, but we \u2013 if you look at our balance sheet and you look at our P&L and you look at our statements, I think you will be able to glean from them that we are investing a lot in R&D and in product development. Anthony Cyganovich : Great, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of S.K. Prasad Borra of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead. S.K. Prasad Borra : Thanks for taking my question. Carlos, could you provide some color on the specific products and services which are driving this new bookings growth? And is it largely driven by ACA or would you say that some of your new platforms whether it\u2019s the advantage or RUN they are also seeing some increased traction? Carlos Rodriguez : I think it\u2019s a combination of both. I think that we are selling some standalone ACA solutions in our up-market space, but most of our ACA new bookings and sales are associated with either existing clients or new clients that have our broader HCM solutions. So, it\u2019s probably safe to say that the ACA sales are being told by our HCM solutions and some of our HCM solution sales are being pulled by ACA. So, it\u2019s probably a combination of the two. So, we had \u2013 I think just to reiterate, we said in the fourth quarter and for the year, we have really across the board strong new business bookings in all of our segments, in all of our strategic platforms without ACA included. I think in the first quarter, we came off of a very, very strong fourth quarter sales and I think we have \u2013 again, for several years, have been talking about how the way our incentives work from a sales standpoint, but it\u2019s somewhat difficult to maintain the momentum into the first quarter when you have such a strong finish, yet we were able to do that. And I think it\u2019s safe to say given the way Jan described it in his comments that ACA helped with that. Under normal circumstances, you probably would have expected in the first quarter and we would have expected kind of just by historical standards mid to low single-digit new bookings growth without kind of the extraordinary tailwinds that we got from ACA. And I think that\u2019s probably a general \u2013 it gives you a general gist of our comments, but we are actually \u2013 in the context of what we know about how ADP behaves and how our sales force behaves and the incentives drive things, we are very pleased with our first quarter new bookings growth, excluding ACA and including ACA. S.K. Prasad Borra : Okay. And just a follow-up, how should one think about the profitability of this increased sales related to ACA? Is it a combination of the PEO business or the low margin PEO business primarily or would you say that some of the more profitable segments like time and attendance and other solutions are also benefiting from this? Carlos Rodriguez : Yes. The \u2013 keep in mind we are selling these ACA solutions as a bundle and so assigning profitability is always a little bit tricky, but our business cases and our plan is to have the margins of the ACA modules to be right in line with our other good functioning products like that you mentioned. So, I would not see any meaningful impact on our overall margin characteristics from them. Other than they are right now growing and have to carry of course implementation and sales cost. But, the ongoing, if you would like the contributing margin of these products is right inline with what we have in our portfolio. S.K. Prasad Borra : That\u2019s great. Thanks Carlos. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Frank [indiscernible] calling in for Sara. Follow up on the strong new bookings, is there any way you can breakout how much was driven by the ACA compliance versus non-ACA solid work? Jan Siegmund : We don\u2019t really breakout in detail, the product components that we have. It was a contributor to the 14%, but as Carlos said, on a typical quarter our internal plans for calling, we would expect after a strong fourth quarter kind of mid to high single digit sales growth in first quarter and we really accelerated across the board. So that\u2019s kind of what we say. So it was not the majority of our sales growth quite the opposite actually our core strategic platforms sold well and had nice growth rates in the quarter, multinationals had a great success stories this quarter. So, it was a broad-based acceleration of \u2013 of new business bookings. And ACA had a trigger event to that, so it\u2019s hard to separate it also analytically because, people that buy ACA also buy HCM solutions in order to make it all work. So it is kind of combination and not, I think that\u2019s kind of honestly of what we can \u2013 really mostly analytically give you. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thanks. And then just as a follow up, did your guidance contemplate retention improving significantly through the rest of the year? Jan Siegmund : While the retention is, is as a quarterly measure fluctuates and I mean Carlos gave detailed comments on the retention development. So, the \u2013 we also, I\u2019d like to mention in the first quarter prior year we had a large improvement, significant improvement in the quarter. So there was probably some catch-up in this quarter and a difficult compare and overall I think, we don\u2019t guide to retention, but I think there would be a mistake to think retention would continue at these levels. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open, please go ahead. Gary Bisbee : Hi. Just following up on that question retention, so Carlos, it sounded like in your commentary there were some, staffing issues or execution issues from the client service perspective. And I guess I just wanted to understand on the margin commentary for the company overall. Is that \u2013 is that basically just the on-boarding cost and sales commissions from the stronger bookings or is there also a component of, we need to fix something here to get this retention back on track. And specifically what type of cost would those be? Thanks. Carlos Rodriguez : So, as various stood observation and I would say that we are \u2013 we did feel some pressure in certain areas of our business, but frankly we have other parts of our business where retention improved and margins were up and all is good. It\u2019s as usual it\u2019s a portfolio and we have different situations in different parts of the \u2013 of the business in the company. But the one thing that is absolutely clear again decades and decades of experiences that, despite our desire to migrate or to upgrade and migrate our clients to our newest and best platforms. This retention figure is very, very important to us. We are very fortunate that we have very, very strong new business bookings, which is offsetting some of the retention weakness that we have. But generally speaking that puts pressure on us, because obviously those, even if we achieve the same revenue growth we\u2019ve been accelerating our revenue growth, it comes with pressure on margin, because you have implantation cost and sales cost. And so, we\u2019ve been very, very clear about desire to accelerate migrations and we did that, and we may be did it a little too effectively. And so, I think we\u2019ve created some pressure in the system as a result of a significant increase in migrations year-over-year. At the same time when we were experiencing frankly, I would describe it as a not to overstated, but we were surprised by the volume of sales that we\u2019ve gotten as a result in some part, as a result of ACA compliance solution demand. So, we have this combination of all those volumes that\u2019s coming in, while at the same time we were creating pressure in our implementation and service organization around migrations. And I think we\u2019ve, I think we took a pause and recognize that this is the right time to make sure that we are still pushing, we are not backing up for migrations, we have a lot of data that we\u2019ve looked out very, very carefully over the last two or three weeks that shows that the retention on our new strategic platforms is very, very high and is remaining in very high levels, because we have the ability to compare retention by platform, but also over time. And we\u2019re very, very confident that our long-term strategy of moving these clients is the right strategy and it will end up creating the same outcome that we now have in our SPS business. But, you see the impact of what happened in the quarter, when you push a little too hard and you have other moving parts and other variables like ACA and overall strong bookings across the board. So, I think your observations are correct, they are stood, and we are doing whatever we can to stabilize here and make sure that we deliver on these commitments that we\u2019ve made to our clients on these new business bookings regarding ACA and at the same time, delivering our commitments to our existing clients who deserve to have the right level of service from our \u2013 from our service organization. And so I think what you\u2019re seeing from a margin, I think the last part of your question was really around margin. We have added, I would say somewhere between 500 and 1000 people just as during the probably beginning before the first quarter and that\u2019s on effective basis we have this cost already in our quarter. And I think Jan was clear about that, that. As of today based on what we know today and the bookings growth that we have experienced so far, we believe that we have the proper expense in the plan to handle, the stabilization of our new starts for ACA as well as the needs to stabilize our service organization to handle the combination of the new volume as well as the migrations. Obviously if were to experience additional incremental above what we\u2019ve guided, new starts we would have to come back and revisit. But, as of today, we\u2019re very very comfortable that we have addressed the issue and you can see that, we still have pretty good margin results despite what is frankly a quite a large investment that we\u2019ve put back into the business. I think that speaks to some of the underlying improvement and good execution that we\u2019ve had for several years around margin and expense control that allows us to ramp up, expenses to this level and still deliver what I believe are very respectable results that are still something to be proud of. Gary Bisbee : Thank you. I appreciate the commentary. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Grossman of Stifel Financial. Your line is open. Please go ahead. David Grossman : Hi, great. Thank you. Sorry, just to follow-up on that last question and so if you look at the business than looking at the retention rate, it sounds like if you see all that the \u2013 the core issue is really one implantation complexity versus competitive losses that come with the churning if you will exposure that comes with the platform upgrade? Carlos Rodriguez : I think I said it\u2019s both and we clearly, because we can see our retention rates by platform. We know where we have exposure and we have weakness and of course we have known that for years, which is why we\u2019re doing what we\u2019re doing, because that is really I think ADP\u2019s vulnerability, I think to some of the comp which there is plenty of \u2013 there is plenty of competition out there. And I think that has been a vulnerability that we over the last three or fours have opted to try to close and I think I have used the analogy of kind of making sure that people are fishing in a smaller and smaller pond, when we create activity around migrations, particularly in the mid market and up market. A lot of fisherman comes even to a smaller pond and so, I think we\u2019ve experienced that some of that over the \u2013 over the quarter. But I also want to be clear that, I \u2013 in my previous answer that the, in addition to that the overall increase in activity and volume as put strain on our implementation and service organization. And they have done an incredible job over the last two or three months to get, a lot of this business that is \u2013 that has been sold in the fourth quarter started. And they are doing that, and they are doing a tremendous job, but they are working very, very hard under tremendous strain which is why we\u2019ve added additional resources to help them. David Grossman : Okay. And just, follow up on Jan\u2019s comment about, the not to assume that retention would stay at these levels, is that contemplating that the increased capacity that you put in would help kind of alleviate some of the stress on the system that you are experiencing with current quarter? Carlos Rodriguez : Yes. And I think what you see is the incremental resources are already doing their thing. So we see already these improvements coming through. So we obviously work very hard to retain every client that we can. And I gave you the typical compare, so the other factors in it we do not give guidance to revenue retention, but it would certainly be not our expectation to stay at this level. David Grossman : Alright, very good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Smitti Srethapramote of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, Carlos and Jan. This is Daniel Hussein [ph] calling in for Smitti. Just want to pry in a little bit more into retention. So I appreciate that you gave a good amount of color already, but could you just provide a little bit more detail about which channel saw the most I guess attrition. And I know you guys look closely at where your customers are going, so did any competitor or type of competitors stand out or was it just the usual suspect? Carlos Rodriguez : It really as usual, I wish we had more exciting news to tell you because it would be easier for us to have one competitor. Theoretically it would be easier, but it is really not that kind of story like we really \u2013 by the way it fluctuates also from quarter-to-quarter. So we unfortunately don\u2019t have any news to report on that front. We don\u2019t have any specific competitor that is doing a lot better or a lot worse than last year and likewise, the same in the other direction. We usually have a very, very broad group of competitors. And remember, we compete against some competitors in the up-market, which are different from the ones that we compete in the mid-market, which are different from the ones we compete in the low end of the market. But again just to add, we have to be careful in terms of \u2013 we are not trying to help our competitors here on these calls. But I think we have given you a lot of information already. So when we say that we experienced a great deal of pressure in turnover as a result of migrations and we told you last quarter that we are done with our run migrations in the low end of the business, you could probably jump to the conclusion that we didn\u2019t have a retention problem in SBS or that maybe it even improved. But we wouldn\u2019t be able to tell you that because we don\u2019t provide guidance by business unit. I think Jan also mentioned that once you get into the up-market, in the mid-market the comparisons do matter and we have a difficult compare versus last year\u2019s first quarter. But we are also trying to be transparent and share with you the information that we are seeing, which is this churn in our legacy base combined with what was enormous pressure on our service and implementation organization as a result of a large surge in business that I think with the benefit of hindsight, needed to have had additional resources to handle and we have those resources now in place. Jan Siegmund : Maybe one last comment is, as you saw, we really left our revenue guidance intact and left it intact for Employer Services and just down ticked it for the divestiture of our AdvancedMD business, which tells you also that we are confident about achieving the revenue number in the framework that we are guiding to, which contemplates of course, client retention in the revenue model. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thanks. And then maybe just a quick question on the debt issue. At this point, would you characterize $2 billion as testing the waters or is this sort of at this point what you think your capital structure should look like? Jan Siegmund : Yes. So we affirmed at our Investor Day and also during our debt IPO that we committed to our AA rating and solidly in it, as you know we have requirements that in our money movement and client fund operation that make a strong exceptionally strong credit rating very helpful. And so you should think of this as a one and a deal of $2 billion debt on our balance sheet. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Lisa Ellis : Hi, good morning guys. Can you give an idea of \u2013 given the dates associated with the ACA regulation, how long \u2013 like, what you are anticipating the elevated bookings outlook to look like, how this will play out over the next four, six, eight quarters? Carlos Rodriguez : I wish \u2013 this is all going to be somewhat speculative because we have never been through an ACA. As you know, this is a new law and its complex, and its been phased in over time and now there are some real pieces, if you will and real penalties and real requirements with forms and so forth that kick in on January 1. But we have never seen this before. And so it\u2019s hard to imagine, but some of the things that we are looking at as an example is what percentage of our client base has purchased or has taken the ACA solutions that we are \u2013 that we are selling. And the answer is it\u2019s less than half, significantly less than half. And so there probably is some additional upside. And I think there is two scenarios. One is on January 1, everyone stops working \u2013 worrying about ACA and our new bookings return to kind of our normal levels of 8% to 10% or somewhere in that range. The other scenario is that come January 1 or January 30 or the end of February, people worry more about ACA because all of a sudden, the reality has hit. And that continues to drive demand for our solutions but also the solutions of some of our competitors and other people out there. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle, it\u2019s hard to believe that there will be no additional interest or demand for ACA compliance or HCM solutions that help with ACA compliance post-January 1. But we really would literally be speculating if and guessing as to what those levels would be. And you just saw what happened over the last six months which is that we kind of underestimated and under guessed the level of activity and demand for these products. And in theory, we should have known better and now we are going to be a little \u2013 probably a little bit more vigilant and make sure that we are prepared if we would have to continued demand at the levels that we are seeing today. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. And then on that to follow-up, can you give us a little bit of a temperature check on the PEO business, which continues to churn along very strongly, is primarily what you are seeing there are still Greenfield sales or are you sort of benefiting from some of the struggles with some of your competitors in that area? Carlos Rodriguez : Yes. Traditionally, ADP\u2019s PEO has grown from two sources of leads from our own client base and Greenfield clients. And the mix of that has been balanced and it continues to be very balanced. And the execution in the PEO is extremely solid and is a very competitive product. So I think we are seeing just a continuation of a trend, nothing specifically to report relative to the competitive environment. We have been the market leader with a superior product for very long time and execution and I think we are benefiting from that strength and continued to do so. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Ryan Cary : Good morning. This is Ryan Cary calling in for Jason. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a quick question on pays per control, I know you reiterated the full year expectation to 2% to 3%. It seems like the 2%, 2.5% in the quarter is a little bit lower than we have see in sometime, anything to reenter there or is just it bouncing around quarter-to-quarter? Carlos Rodriguez : I think what we are seeing is a little bit of a maturing in the growth in labor market. In our case, I think we were kind of right in the middle of what we expected. So it has to do with the hiring situation of some of our clients. I think manufacturing energy slowed a little bit. So I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it. I think this is more a general comment about what is your assessment about the overall economic growth in the labor market to be done and I think we had for many, many years strong, strong labor market. And it seems to be now a little bit maturing, still at a very good clip. So I am not too worried about it. I think it\u2019s kind of right in line of where we thought it would be. Ryan Cary : Okay, great. And I just wanted to touch on pricing with my second question. First, could you talk about some of the trends you have seen in the quarter and then we are looking at the continued strong new business bookings we have seen over the several quarters, do you see pricing is the driver for any of these deal wins? Carlos Rodriguez : Yes. So in pricing, I think we have to analytically always separate what\u2019s happening in pricing in our base and what is happening in pricing on our new deals. And so I think with your question, you are targeting a little bit what is the pricing environment for new deals. And we monitor that very carefully and measure it as kind of at a relative discounting levels that we have in the business. And they do fluctuate as we also excise different sales strategies in different markets, but the overall mix and discounting levels stays the same. So, we do see a stable competitive environment relative to pricing. Relative to our base, we continue to execute a strategy that targets less than 8% of price increase in our base, which is consistent of what we communicated with you in our Investor Day earlier in spring and we are executing exactly along our plans. Ryan Cary : Great, thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim MacDonald of First Analysis. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jim MacDonald : Yes, good morning guys. I wanted to follow-up on Carlos\u2019 point about migrations being done for small business, could you talk about how many migrations are left in the other businesses that could impact retention? Carlos Rodriguez : I think the guidance we have given in the past or I wouldn\u2019t call it formal guidance, but we have been talking about trying to complete our migrations in our mid-market by the end of fiscal year \u201817 and we are still on track to do that and that will have all of our clients on our current version of Workforce Now. We have made really tremendous progress over the last year. And I think we talked about in the last call that we had put in incremental resources to accelerate migrations and we did that very effectively, which as I mentioned also happened to put some pressure on us execution wise. But we have really made great progress. There was a platform in the mid-market called PCPW, which we are now down to, I think, it\u2019s 100 clients or less. So, it\u2019s a very big accomplishment, because that was a fairly large base in our mid-market space. And so we are just kind of methodically going through the same process that we went through in our small business division. I think someone reminded me just a few days ago the process in SBS of first stopping sales on the older platforms and then beginning the process of migration took a total of 5 to 6 years. And so these are not overnight. This is a recurring revenue model. We value client retention and we value our clients. And we do have to get off of these platforms, but we will not do it on anybody\u2019s timeline other than our own timeline when it\u2019s the right time under the right circumstances. And I think we have a good plan that we have been executing in our mid-market and we are I think on track on that plan. In the up-market, we have said multiple times that it\u2019s a bigger challenge given the size of the clients and the complexity and frankly, the number of platforms we have. But I think there too, we have taken steps and built into this year\u2019s plan a good number of migrations over to our Vantage platform that we are starting to execute on some of that, whereas a couple of years ago, we had literally no migrations on Vantage, so then maybe we had a couple of year we have \u2013 I am not going to disclose exactly the number, but we have some number of migrations. By the way, these are all pool migrations for now, where the clients are lining up and want to be upgraded to Vantage. So, this is not a push or a forced migration at this point. And so I think it\u2019s safe to say we are on track in terms of our plans in up-market as well. Jim MacDonald : Right. And as a follow-up, I hear you settle your spat with the benefits, but did that have any impact in the quarter or distraction? Carlos Rodriguez : We had a lot of distraction, no impact. Jim MacDonald : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Tien- Tsin Huang : Great. Thanks as always for all the details. Just one question for me. Just also on price, but I will ask it in a different way, just in terms of playing defense I get that you are more disciplined on pricing in general, but did you have potential to pull the pricing lever to protect your book from leaving as part of some of these migrations and you chose not to. Just curious what your tactic there was to try and actually protect that book as they transitioned? Carlos Rodriguez : I think it\u2019s a fair question. I think it\u2019s \u2013 I think the truth is that this was not a pricing issue. Tien- Tsin Huang : So, I guess this sounds means you don\u2019t want to elaborate on that? Carlos Rodriguez : Well, I am sorry, what was the rest of the question? Tien- Tsin Huang : Yes, I guess if it\u2019s not pricing, was it just sort of the change in desire to move to different platform or do you use a new service provider, I am just trying to better understand that? Carlos Rodriguez : Well, I tend to choke on my words when I confess that we had execution channels, so if you could just let me off the hook. Tien- Tsin Huang : Okay, fair enough. I am good. It makes sense. Thanks guys. Sara Grilliot : We have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Rick Eskelsen of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Rick Eskelsen : Good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in here. Carlos, I wondered if you can go back and talk about analytics, you talked about that in your upfront commentary. Just wondering how you guys are pricing it and viewing it for clients? And how much is built in versus being sold separately to clients? Is it something that helps you win a deal or is it something that you are looking to actively sort of monetize here? Carlos Rodriguez : I will answer on the pricing side. We have a number of modules that are incremental to our core HCM product. So, as you buy payroll, obviously and time and attendance benefits and others we have employee per month charges and incremental products like analytics is charged on an incremental basis also and comes in different flavors depending on how comprehensive you want to subscribe to the benefit \u2013 to the benchmarking and deep analytic services. So, yes, a short answer is it is an incremental per employee per month charge and we are planning to monetize it for the vast amount of our business. Jan Siegmund : And everything we do is to help us win more business. So, I think that last part of your question clearly we do think that it helps differentiate us and helps us win deals. Rick Eskelsen : Thank you. Then just a quick follow-up. With your switch now to EBIT margins, are you going to be talking about the segments more in EBIT or still on sort of a pre-tax basis? Thank you. Jan Siegmund : It\u2019s kind of the same really. There is no difference. We call it now segment margins, but those obviously do not include ES and PEO don\u2019t include any interest charges on the long-term debt. So, they are really unchanged. Rick Eskelsen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you all for joining us today. As you could probably tell from our tone, we are really excited about the strong start that we had to the year and we are really happy with our momentum, especially in our new business bookings. You also probably heard our tone that we definitely feel like we have some challenges in front of us in terms of implementing all this new business, so that we really deliver on our commitments to our clients to help them comply with the new and complex healthcare regulations, but I think I also want to take this time to really thank all of our associates from sales, implementation and service for all the hard work they have done. It\u2019s been a very challenging 6 months and particularly, a challenging quarter in terms of workloads. And we appreciate everything they are doing and they are going to continue to do to build upon ADP\u2019s past successes. Thank you, again for joining us and thank you for your interest in ADP. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Have a great rest of your day.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP\u2019s Second Quarter Fiscal 2016 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Ms. Sara Grilliot, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Sara Grilliot : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. This is Sara Grilliot, ADP\u2019s Vice President, Investor Relations, and I am here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer and Jan Siegmund, ADP\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call and webcast. Carlos will begin today\u2019s call with some opening remarks, and then Jan will take you through the quarter\u2019s results and provide an update on what you expect for fiscal 2016. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. I would like to remind everyone that today\u2019s call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. With that, I will turn the call over to Carlos. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you, Sara and good morning everyone. This morning, we reported results for our second quarter of fiscal 2016, which included revenue growth of 6% or 8% on a constant dollar basis. This solid revenue growth was impacted by about 1 percentage point from the sale of our AdvancedMD business at the end of the first fiscal quarter. In the second quarter, we continued to see very strong demand for our solutions, which is evidenced by our new business bookings growth of 15%. Sales of additional human capital management modules that assist with Affordable Care Act or ACA compliance continued to contribute meaningfully to this performance, which has exceeded our expectations on a year-to-date basis. As a result, we are now forecasting new business bookings growth of at least 12% for fiscal 2016. In addition to delivering this solid performance, we have returned to shareholders an additional $780 million through share repurchases in the first half of the fiscal year. And in November of 2015, our Board approved an increase of our cash dividend of 8% marking our 41st consecutive year of dividend increases. These actions demonstrate our commitment to shareholder friendly actions and are intended to contribute to ADP\u2019s goal of achieving top-quartile total shareholder return. It has been an exciting and challenging quarter for ADP and our associates as we help our clients prepare to comply with the ACA. Our teams have worked very hard to implement, human capital management modules that were sold during calendar 2015, and I am pleased with the number of units started on our ACA platforms during the quarter. This is performance that we should be proud of. And I want to thank our associates for all of their hard work and dedication to our clients. We now have more than 14,000 US clients with over 50 full-time employees live on our ACA solutions. Let me put that achievement into perspective. By the end of March, employers with 50 plus employees will be required to send Form 1095-C to each of their employees describing the health insurance available to them. This is the most significant employee tax filing form that the US government has introduced since the W2, and ADP is on track to deliver about 10 million of them in the first year. Success of our ACA solution is just one example of ADP\u2019s proficiency in dealing with complex compliance issues. From helping clients determine eligibility for Work Opportunity Tax Credits signed into law just weeks ago to preparing for anticipated changes in overtime rules, ADP\u2019s expertise is unique in the dynamic world of HR compliance. And as this complexity grows, many clients are choosing to outsource HR entirely to ADP. Our PEO business, ADP TotalSource experienced another strong quarter growing revenue 18% and average work site employees by 14% in the second quarter. With this growth, we eclipsed an exciting milestone. ADP TotalSource, already the largest PEO in the US, now supports more than 400,000 client employees. In fact, if ADP TotalSource were an independent employer, it would rank them on the top size private employers in the US. On the new product front, while in its early days, we are excited about the progress we are making with our analytics platform called ADP DataCloud. During the quarter, we fully released the benchmarking capability with more than a 1,000 job titles, which allows our clients to generate actionable insights from workforce data embedded in their ADP HCM solutions. The benchmarking platform available for US companies draws aggregated and anonymized information from ADP\u2019s large US client base. And of course, ADP\u2019s data advantage is a global one. During the quarter, we introduced the ADP France National Employment Report as part of our commitment to adding deeper insights into the labor markets globally and providing businesses, governments and others with a source of credible and valuable information. Similar to the US report, each month ADP will publish aggregated employment statistics from an anonymized sample drawing from 1.3 million workers included among ADP\u2019s client base in France. Here is just a few examples of ADP\u2019s leadership in the HCM category, which continues to receive positive external recognition. Most recently, Ventana Research recognized our ADP Vantage platform with its Technology Innovation Award in the Business Innovation Category. In bestowing this honor, Ventana recognized us for our ability to \u201chelp employees not just the efficient through modern user experience, but actually enjoy working with the application\u201d. It\u2019s always gratifying to see the HCM community recognize the progress we have made with our platforms. And now, I would like to give you an update on client retention. In the second quarter, ADP experienced a decline in retention of 120 basis points, which marks a sequential improvement over the first quarter. While we are disappointed to see this metric slip from its recent historical high, we are pleased that retention on our strategic platforms remains high. Consistent with the first quarter, the majority of the retention decline stems from clients on mature technology and we still believe that market activity from employers choosing their ACA providers has introduced a change event for our clients. Although disappointing, our management team remains focused on this metric and we have taken actions to address opportunities we have for improvement. Our progress on client migrations remains a key area of focus for us. And based on the success we have seen in our small business services unit with all clients now on ADP RUN, we believe these migrations are the right thing for our clients and for the long-term success of our business. As evidence of this, in December, we reached a milestone as we were able to sunset the PCPW platform in the mid-market, a legacy payroll product. Many clients have chosen ADP for our strength and expertise in compliance. We are in a time when the level of uncertainty in the regulatory environment is higher than it\u2019s been in decades. And as a result, our clients are even more reliant on our service teams. As a management team, we remain focused on the client experience, which includes staffing our service teams to the level appropriate for assisting our clients with these HCM needs. Since last quarter, we have hired over 1,000 associates to assist our clients and expect to receive the benefit of adding these talented people in the coming months. Once again, I want to thank and congratulate these new, as well as our tenured associates for their continued contributions to our success. I\u2019ll wrap, which is one reflection from our ReThink Global HCM Conference, which I attended last week in Rome. There we had Executive HR, Finance, IT and Security leaders together to explore global perspectives around managing and cultivating the foundation of organizational success. It\u2019s clear that winning the war for talent as well as handling compliance on a global scale are critical issues facing businesses around the world. What\u2019s even clear to me is that no organization is better positioned to help these clients that we are. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jan for a further review of our second quarter results and an update on our fiscal 2016 outlook. Jan Siegmund : Thank you very much, Carlos and good morning everyone. During the quarter, we realized a gain of $14 million from the sale of the building. My comments on the quarter refer to adjusted results, which exclude the impact of this gain. ADP revenues grew 6% or 8% on a constant dollar basis. This growth includes approximately 1 percentage point of pressure due to the divestiture of the AdvancedMD business, which occurred at the end of the first quarter. As Carlos mentioned, our new business bookings remained strong posting 15% growth for the second quarter. Adjusted earnings, before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT grew 2% or 4% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted EBIT margin decreased about 70 basis points compared to 18.7% in the last year's second quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 4% to $0.72 or 6% on a constant dollar basis, and benefited from a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with the year ago. The slower earnings growth we realized in the second quarter as well as the decline in margins were anticipated as we made planned investments to increase operational resources in support of our service teams and new product implementations. In addition, increased selling expenses resulting from higher than anticipated new business bookings also contributed to the slower growth. In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 3% for the quarter or 6% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was primarily driven by net new business additions in the quarter. As a reminder, new recurring revenue from ACA related modules is not expected to impact revenue growth until the third fiscal quarter. As Carlos discussed, client revenue retention decreased 120 basis points for the quarter as we continued to experience an elevated losses from clients on legacy platforms. Our same-store pays per control metric in the US grew 2.5% in the second quarter. Average client fund balances grew 4% compared to a year-ago or 6% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was driven by additions from new business as well as increased pays per control. Outside the US, growth in our multinational solutions remained strong. Employer Services margin declined about 30 basis points in the quarter due to planned investments that we have made in operational resources to install new business sold and provide services to our clients as well as higher selling expenses from continued strong new business bookings. ADP's PEO continues to perform very well with revenue growth of 18% in the second quarter. As Carlos mentioned, the PEO reached a milestones in the quarter surpassing 400,000 average client employees to reach 403,000, which represents growth of 14%. We continue to see an increase in benefit plan participation rates from our work site employees, a trend we expect to continue for the remainder of the fiscal year. The PEO also continues to drive margin expansion through operating efficiencies expanding margins by approximately 20 basis points in the quarter. We are pleased with the progress we've made through fiscal year - for the first half of fiscal year 2016, particularly with the success we have seen in new business bookings. As Carlos mentioned, we are now forecasting new business bookings growth of at least 12% compared to our prior forecast of at least 10%. As a result of this change to our expectations and the strengthening of the US dollar, which occurred towards the end of calendar year 2015, we have updated certain elements of our fiscal year 2016 forecast. ADP now expects fiscal year 2016 revenue growth of about 7% compared with our prior forecast of 7% to 8%. This change is due to higher than anticipated pressure from unfavorable foreign currency translation, which is now expected to impact our revenue growth by about 2 percentage points for the fiscal year. On a constant dollar basis, ADP now expects revenue growth of 9%, which is the higher end of our previously forecasted range of 8% to 9%. This updated forecast reflects our increased expectations for new business bookings growth as well as our confidence in the recurring revenue, which will start from new solutions sold over the past three quarters. And as a reminder, this forecast also includes almost 1 percentage points of expected pressure from the sale of the AdvancedMD business which occurred toward the end of the first quarter. For the Employer Services segment, revenue growth is anticipated to be 4% to 5% compared with our prior forecast of 5% to 6% due to higher than anticipated pressure from unfavorable foreign currency translation. On the constant dollar basis, revenue growth is now expected to be about 7% compared with our prior forecast of 6% to 7%. Due to the strong half performance - first half performance of the PEO, ADP is now anticipating 16% to 18% growth for this segment compared to our prior forecast of 15% to 17%. Our forecast for adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 50 basis points is unchanged. On a segment level, we are now expecting margin expansion of about 75 basis points in Employer Services compared with our prior forecast of about 100 basis points. Margin expansion expectations for the PEO remain unchanged. ADP has made some minor changes to our forecast for the client funds extended investment strategy to adjust for the December 2015 increase in the Fed funds rate as well as additional pressure anticipated from foreign currency translation that is expected to reduce our balance growth. These changes are not material to our overall forecast and the details can be found in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow 11% to 13% from the $2.89 in fiscal year 2015 compared with our prior forecast growth of 12% to 14%. This forecast reflects additional selling expenses anticipated from increased new business bookings, higher than anticipated pressure from unfavorable foreign currency translation which is assumed to have a negative impact of 1 to 2 percentage points on earnings per share growth. On a constant dollar basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share growth is expected to be 12% to 14% compared with our prior forecast of 13% to 15% growth. These changes to our full year outlook reflect the results of our first half and our expectations for the balance of the fiscal year 2016. However, we continue to acknowledge that changing factors in the marketplace due to uncertainty around ACA compliance could put a short-term strain on our earnings growth. We remain committed to our strategy and to our clients, which we believe will yield the best results for ADP over the long run. So, with that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Grossman from Stifel Financial. David Grossman : Thank you. You mentioned that the Sunset PCPW platform in the mid-market during the quarter, given that a lot of the churn has happened in the legacy platform, should that favorably impact retention just arithmetically as we go into the back half of the year? Carlos Rodriguez : So we have been keeping track of retention by platform which is obviously where we have the information about our legacy platforms versus our strategic platforms and there is no question that the PCPW platform as it got into its final stages of migrations had very low retention rate, but over the last 12 months that was relative to the total size of ADP and even to the size of our mid-market business, I would say that, it would not be a material change. We have other legacy products that are - the largest of more clients on them that are also underperforming from a retention standpoint that are greater focus for us than just a mathematical improvement from PCPW retirement, because it is just not mathematically, I think, significant because it's been waning over the last 12 months even as we got close to the final retirement of the final clients. David Grossman : I see. So, I mean, if you step back and you just look at some of the some changes, Carlos, in the enterprise IP staff impact that\u2019s having on customer buying patterns, with that as a backdrop, are you seeing any change in the way the market is segmenting between those that choose a platform like ADP with services wrapped around it and the software-only platform and if you are, what are the key differentiators that are changing between the different buyers? Carlos Rodriguez : I think if you take our new business bookings as an indication it would seem that there is still quite a lot of strength and interest in buying a solution that has services wrapped around it. And I think the fact that we\u2019ve had these robust sales around ACA compliance which does include a service component to it in terms of assistance with compliance, not just providing the software, reinforces our belief that we think our technology and services enabled model is the right model. It doesn\u2019t mean that other models are not good and that other people won\u2019t choose other models, but we like our approach and it seems to be frankly right now gaining traction in the marketplace. David Grossman : Very good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets. Jay Hanna : Hi, this Jay Hanna covering for Gary today. I just had a question regarding the buyback. Are you anticipating using any additional operating cash flow in addition to the $2 billion you already planned on the buyback or are you happy with the offering covering most of the buyback for the remainder over the next two years? Thanks. Jan Siegmund : Jay, you will see our cash balances of slightly below $3 billion at the end of the quarter and we stopped really thinking in ADP about separating our initial debt offering from the cash at hand that is generated out of the operating cash flow. So we continue on our steady path of returning the cash to shareholders via an ongoing share buyback program and will proceed to work those cash balances down over time. Jay Hanna : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Sara Gubins : Thank you. Good morning. Could you remind us where you are in the migration of midmarket clients to Workforce Now, so what percent are still on legacy platforms? And are the retention issues largely concentrated with those mid-market customers? Carlos Rodriguez : Sara, we have a - I\u2019d give very rough numbers here to give you more an idea directionally around 75,000 clients in the mid-market and we have about 45,000 clients. So, around 60% or so on the latest version of Workforce Now. So this gives - answers also a little bit David\u2019s first question around the impact that the settlement of PCPW had. It was a small client base and we still have a large number of clients to be migrated in the remainder of this fiscal year and the next fiscal year. That's kind of - those are big milestones and we have communicated prior that we are anticipating to make significant progress towards the end fiscal year \u201817. That's still our plan. Sara Gubins : Okay. And just from a retention perspective, is that really where the primary issue is? Carlos Rodriguez : I think that\u2019s fair. I think that\u2019s what we said in the first quarter. There has really been no material change and again, I think that consistent with what we said in the first quarter, I think the piece of migrations was quite accelerated in the first quarter versus the prior year first quarter. And in the second quarter, it was the same, in part because we had a lot of migrations already in the pipeline and we had momentum. And so I think it\u2019s safe to say that we were on kind of in the same place, if you will, in terms of the pressure that migrations which were the benefit of hindsight and I take some accountability or I take all the accountability as the boss for this that migration is a very big priority for us, but not at any cost. And organizational, we have put a lot of focus and a lot of pressure and the organization as usual responded to the boss. And I think we may have overdone and created an inordinate amount of pressure on the organization as a result of the piece of migrations. I think we also have mentioned that I think the ACA decisions that some of our mid-market clients were making, because in the up-market these are not decisions that you can make over the course of two or three months and in the low end of the market, it doesn\u2019t apply, because companies under 50 employees don\u2019t have to comply. So it really is a mid-market issue and we think it had an impact. We just don't know really how to measure that. And then lastly, I also knowledge that I think we exited the last fiscal year with not enough resources to handle everything I just mentioned, the extra activity around migrations and all of the activity and noise around ACA. So as we\u2019ve mentioned in our comments we\u2019ve added resources and we've taken actions. This is not the first time - ACA is definitely a new factor and the pace of migrations is something that with the benefit of hindsight we probably stepped on the accelerator a little too fast, but we've been through this type of events before. It seems similar to prior times where there's really no concentration of any one particular competitor or any pattern that we can see other than self-inflicted wounds that are reparable and we are in the process of repairing them and we see some signs of improvement. So despite the fact that we still have 40% of the clients in the mid-market, it doesn't necessarily mean that we will have to continue to see and we don't plan on continuing. We obviously have no - we don't provide a forecast and we don\u2019t provide guidance around retention, but I can assure you that we don\u2019t believe that we have to accept the retention levels that we have on our legacy platforms today. So we are not just standing idly by and continuing on the same pace of migrations and with the same actions and don't expect the same results going forward. Sara Gubins : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Lisa Ellis : Hi, good morning, guys. Can you give any qualitative feedback that you get back from the sales teams out there around how clients are thinking about the ACA implementation and whether this is sort of it as we go through this season or whether you expect or they are anticipating making some additional changes over the next year? Carlos Rodriguez : Maybe two comments. Number one, the number of clients that we now have and are eligible and which is the part that\u2019s eligible represents approximately - sold about half of our client base. So we still have I think another half of the client base that we expect to offer some future opportunities, although probably at a slower rate than we expect in the first year to sell the product. And then secondly, the product is for use on an ongoing basis, so it is not really just the implementation and the printing of tax form. It is an advisory tool that helps clients to manage actually their liabilities and the compliance on an ongoing basis, so it's really just a component of an HCM module that clients use and we expect the clients to benefit from it throughout the year as they keep the employees in compliance and like an ongoing tax filing offer. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rick Eskelsen from Wells Fargo. Rick Eskelsen : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I guess I was wondering if you could touch more on the new business bookings and talk about sort of the trends that you are seeing in terms of winning new clients versus expanding and up-selling with the existing clients? So what\u2019s been the biggest driver of the bookings beyond the ACA stuff that you are seeing? Thanks. Carlos Rodriguez : Again, given that we historically don't get into a lot of detail for obviously competitive reasons on our new business bookings, in terms of breaking by segment or by product, but I think it's important for you to understand directionally. And so I think the wording we've used and I think it may have been in my comments or in Jan\u2019s opening comments is that clearly ACA added to our new business bookings growth and exceeded our - or allowed us to exceed our expectations in terms of bookings. So I guess an indirect way of answering your question is that the long-term 8% to 10% new bookings growth that we strive for absent changes [indiscernible] ACA would be safe to say that this year we're on track to achieve that and that performance above and beyond that would be attributable to ACA. And of course that's only with six months done that could change in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter. But I think right now based on the information we have and what we see in terms of market activity, I think that the fair way to look at it and it's important for all of you to understand that because as Jan said, even though we still have an opportunity in front of us, the opportunity is obviously smaller now then it was in the prior year. And so, we don't expect to get as much lift, we hope we do, but we won't expect to get as much lift from ACA in fiscal 2017 in terms of our new bookings growth. Having said all that, most exciting thing for me around ACA and this event in general is it, it should and we hope will drive companies to look at the full HCM bundle. So ACA compliance really requires that you have information not just about how many employees and what they're paid but also about their time, how many hours they work per week, whether they have benefits or don't have benefits. So having for example a Workforce Now platform like we in the mid-market really helps a lot with ACA compliance, not to mention that as we rollout analytics tool and other things to help manage people better those are also attractive features. So I think the combination of the improvements in our user experience, the information that we provide through analytics plus the advantages you get through compliance, we believe and this is our expectation and our hope is that that will continue to generate new business bookings growth in terms of clients and also sales dollars into the future even if the tailwind that we get from ACA diminishes a little bit in fiscal 2017. Rick Eskelsen : Thank you, that's helpful. Just as a follow-up, I was wondering if you talk a little bit more on the mix shift that's you\u2019re seeing in terms of the strong new business bookings and still some challenges with the retention. Any margin implications we should be thinking about here longer term from that mix shift? Thank you. Jan Siegmund : As you saw our adjustment for the forecasts on margins it\u2019s really primarily driven by only two factors. It's driven by higher selling expense, which is, levels above our long-term expectation of new business bookings growth and FX. So, you saw that in that we upped our revenue guidance for the year on a constant dollar basis on a slightly, which kind of takes into account the cost for a higher selling more clients and of course slightly elevated retention if you will. So it's all contemplated in this overall. So the recent adjustment of the margin has really mostly to do with FX and selling expense. Carlos Rodriguez : And I think the base - mathematically with the information that we have today and baked into our forecast is an assumption that despite the pressure we're getting from retention, our revenue growth is accelerating as a result of our strong new business bookings growth. So I think net-net, Jan and I are happy, and I think the organization is very happy because obviously that growth rate, our plan obviously is to get retention stabilized and to make improvements in that area as you've heard because of our additional resources. Assuming that we do that and acceleration in our long-term revenue growth rate is very, very positive for ADP because of the recurring revenue nature and the lifetime value of these clients that we're bringing in. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore ISI. David Togut : Thank you, I appreciate the helpful detail you gave on the remaining conversion schedule, the Workforce Now. Just taking a step back, should we expect client retention to begin to improve again once you complete the conversion to Workforce Now or you just in general seeing much greater competition in the mid-market. And so retention should be something we should keep an eye on even post the conversion to Workforce Now. Carlos Rodriguez : Again, consistent with what we mentioned in the first quarter and I think mentioned a few minutes ago, we have information around both our sales successes against competitors and we also information around our lawsuits against competitors. So unless all of the sudden all of the competitors got together and did something different, there would be nothing in our information that shows that this is a competitive issue in terms of what's driving our retention. So, I think that's one answer to the - one part of the answer to the question. So again, note we don't see any changes in the pricing environment or in the competitive environment. In terms of you know the conversions and immigrations; it is clear as we're pointing out that we're getting pressure on legacy platforms. But it doesn't mean that we can have a better retention rate even on the legacy platform. So, take the example of our down market SBS business. In that business, we went through a migration similar to the one we're describing in majors over the course of multiple years. And as in this case, you have to balance speed with the desire to get done. And in that case, I think we've felt some level of pressure around retention at various points and when we were done with that migration, our retention rates have definitely improved. So they just didn't stabilize but they improved. But in the case of that client migration, we did not encounter some of these - what we term as self-inflicted wounds that we're having here that we believe we can address and we believe we can correct as we're going through the migration. So again, the problem is there is a lot of uncertainty and it's you know very would be I think responsible for us to make definitive statements because we just don't know for sure but I want to make sure that everyone is very, very clear that we believe that we can impact the retention rates in the mid-market even as we're doing these migrations. And I also everybody to understand that we're not going to stop doing the migrations, but we will moderate, we still are on track to be finished by the end of fiscal '17, which was our original plan but the pace at which we do these and the timing of when we do them, I think we will do on our terms in order to maximize the balance between client retention and also the long-term health of our business and what's right for our clients. David Togut : Thank you that's very helpful. Just a quick follow-up. Recognizing you don't give guidance beyond the current year, I'm just trying to understand clearly the bookings growth has been terrific and well above expectations. Client retention possibly could be an issue going into '17 as you continue to convert from legacy mid-market onto Workforce Now. Should we think of the retention issue with being offset by the stronger bookings trajectory or should we think that the retention issue potentially could be an issue for FY17 and beyond? Carlos Rodriguez : So, I'm going to let Jan make a comment but you should again back to the discussion we had about PCPW, just if you think about this mathematically, clearly as we continue to migrate clients, the number of clients on legacy platforms becomes smaller and smaller and mathematically has a smaller and smaller impact on our retention rate. So I would just caution a linear assumption around retention into 2017 even though that's clearly a possibility. But I would caution against making that assumption because that base of clients is becoming smaller and smaller and will have a smaller impact of our overall retention rate. I also want to just reiterate and I'll let Jan weigh in, what we just said earlier, which is, at this point our new business bookings is more than offsetting the pressure we're having from retention. And our revenue growth rate we moved up in terms of our guidance for this year and we're very, very happy with where we are versus our long term range. We have said in the first quarter and we'll say again today that in the second half of this fiscal year on a constant dollar basis, if you adjust for the AdvancedMD disposition which typically would have been included in discontinued ops but because of accounting changes is not in discontinued ops, so if you adjust for that, we will be at the high-end of our long-term revenue growth guidance. Jan Siegmund : And David I think, while we don't give guidance for fiscal year '17, of course I have to wait for two quarters for that. I have only maybe one more comment to emphasize I think in the script call I said, retention of our strategic platforms remains very good. So and I think out of that you can deduct that as that base is growing there should be a mathematical re-weighing of the retention rate that will help and plus what we hope to achieve an improvement of retention in the legacy base. So, those things together plus our revenue update guidance, I think sends you the signal about how we think about the impact on retention really. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of SKPrasad Borra from Goldman Sachs. SKPrasad Borra : Thanks for taking my question. Carlos, just on the client migrations levels, can you remind us what was the client migration level in mid-market beginning of calendar 2015. And also a small clarification is the FY17 objective for only for mid-market or does that apply to up market as well? Jan Siegmund : So I - you addressed it to Carlos, but I'll give you some idea. We migrated almost 7,000 clients in the first quarter of fiscal year '16 in the mid-market and close to 4,000 clients in the second quarter; year-end slowed migrations down a little bit and for the reasons that Carlos described obviously that tempered a little bit in the second half of the last quarter. So that migration pace compared to the prior year was accelerated as we increased the resources available to them. So you should expect basically continued focus on migrations maybe at a similar level as last year maybe slightly accelerated, we're going to go and determine that as operations allow to maintain our goal of finishing migrations, the vast majority of migrations in the mid-market by the end of fiscal year '17. So that's the goal, the up market migrations will be a multi-year effort and we're going to proceed together in partnership with our clients and I don't think we're going to give specific migration numbers for the up market, will be an ongoing effort to move those clients. SKPrasad Borra : Jan, this question is definitely for you. Just on the margins, obviously ACA business is the mix of products, services and various offerings from your end. To the point you can clarify, is the margin profile of the ACA business going to be post all this implementation costs and higher selling costs. Is the margin profile going to be more closer to the products business or is it going to be closer to the PEO business. Jan Siegmund : Well that is a loaded question because the PEO has pass-throughs in its P&L and if you exclude the pass-throughs from the P&L, PEO margins you'll see actually there even slightly ahead of our ES margins. So, the characteristic of ADP and then very interesting way is that we have a margin profile that is actually very similar between our product sets and even our HR BPO products excluding the pass-throughs have margin characteristics that are roughly in line for most of the cases with our overall margin profiles. So if you think about ADP as a kind of growth margin for an ongoing contribution of the recurring revenue model. The ACA product is to have - expected to have exactly that margin profile. So we don't think about it in anyway different than the rest of our product set. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Ashish Sabadra : Hello. This is Ashish Sabadra calling on behalf of Bryan Keane. A quick question on the PEO, the gap between revenues and the worksite that was 4% this quarter. So on the last call, you had mentioned that it may normalize to 2 to 3 points, but it looks like it's trending north of it. I was just wondering do you continue to see some good traction there on the benefit adoption, what's driving it and how do you think about that gap going forward for the rest of the year? Carlos Rodriguez : Yeah. I think that you hit the nail on the head, which has been the benefits. The number of clients selecting and the number of worksite employees selecting benefits does have an impact on the growth of our top line revenue versus worksite employee growth because of the pass-through nature of the benefits revenues. And so we do have a chart that shows and I think we may have even mentioned it in our comments in the script that the benefits participation rate is trending upwards, so it had been trending downwards several years ago pre-ACA, and now it's trending upwards, it's not a dramatic increase, but it's enough to help drive additional difference between our worksite employee growth and our top line revenue growth, which is why it\u2019s so important until we get the margin dynamics of that business, excluding those pass-through revenues. Ashish Sabadra : That's great color. And then quickly on the pricing, you\u2019re in the peak selling season, are you seeing any shift in the pricing environment? Jan Siegmund : No. We observe pricing very closely and two factors are important. One is our discounting levels, as we distribute new business in our new business bookings and those discounting levels have been very consistent with prior quarters, so no change in the marketplace. And secondly, we indicated that our long-term goal is to have price increases to our client base closer to 50 basis points than the historic 100 basis points and we're trending right along that, right in between this year, a little bit less than a percent of price increases to our client base, unchanged and 100% in line with our expectations. Ashish Sabadra : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Daniel Hussain from Morgan Stanley. Daniel Hussain : Hi, Carols and Jan. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask a couple of clarifying questions about new business bookings. So first on your back half guidance, it seems to bake in 10% growth, is that just conservatism given you\u2019re not really sure what demand for ACA would look like in the next couple of quarters or are you actually already seeing some slowdown there? And then secondly, I know new business bookings is at the run rate revenue number, so wouldn't there be FX impact in there as well, and therefore with newer bookings a couple of points higher, or would it be very similar given a lot of that came from the ACA product, which is mostly US? Thanks. Carlos Rodriguez : I think at the risk of getting into trouble, I think the answer is yes to both questions, but it is what our forecast is. So I think you\u2019re mathematically correct about second-half bookings growth, so I don't think we want to say much more, rather than its accurate that we have no real definite sense of what's going to happen in terms of the tailwind around ACA in the second half and hence it is what it is, in terms of our forecast. And then the second part of your question is accurate, too, I would just remind you that our bookings outside of the US are not a large part of the overall sales result, but there would be some impact from FX in it. That would be a fair statement. But I would not quantify a couple of percentage points extra growth in new business bookings. Jan Siegmund : I think that's fair. And maybe one point that we finished our last fiscal year 2015 in the fourth quarter with a very, very strong quarter. So there is a big growth over in the fourth quarter that you would also have to consider. So that probably factored also in our overall expectations. Daniel Hussain : Got it. Thanks. And then maybe a high-level question on PEO, so it's been growing at a healthy pace for the past 15 years or so since you've been in the business, and I imagine a lot of your customer base has now been educated about it or has heard of it, but at the same time, the value prop seems to be increasing over time, so just in that context, is there a way that you can help us think about maybe what inning we\u2019re in, in terms of double-digit growth or is it just really hard to tell and it just depends too much on regulation and insurance, and so forth? Carlos Rodriguez : Well, again, I am not going to attempt to answer that question, because if you had asked me that question six or seven years ago, I would have probably said that it was going to get really, really hard because how big the business had gone. So we\u2019re selling now just each month, the number of worksite employees we have to sell in order to and start in order to maintain this growth rate is close to what the size of the business was when I first entered that business, because that's where I started my career was in a PEO. I then got acquired by ADP. So I\u2019m the wrong person to answer that question in terms of, because it is large numbers, it\u2019s becoming - as we said, it\u2019s now one of the largest private employers in the US, but it is a very, very strong value proposition with very strong momentum and very talented management team. So we definitely don't have any plans to slow it down and to see a slowdown because on a per client or per worksite employee basis, no matter how you look at it, that business is a winner for ADP. And we convert about half of the business that starts into PEO, comes from existing ADP clients that we upsell and that's an incredibly powerful formula for us because I think we are one of the few that have that advantage of having the salesforce and the installed client base that we have that we have the ability to upgrade. So we\u2019re very, very happy with that business and we hope that it continues to grow at these robust rates. Daniel Hussain : Understood. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang from JP Morgan. Tien- tsin Huang : Thanks. Just two questions, just on the upper end of the market or the enterprise side of the market, what's going on there in terms of sales and retention, any change in trend there given the macro? Carlos Rodriguez : Again, I will say that we try to avoid for a variety of reasons getting into specifics by segment or by business unit. But I think it's safe to say that we don't see any - in that business, you do have to look at it, I think multiple quarters, I think one month or a couple of months does not make a trend, just because of the lumpiness of that business, but I think if you look at our upmarket business overall, I don't think we see any material change. I think our vantage platform is still selling well. Our multinational international platform is selling well. I think on the retention front, there is really nothing to report either in terms of any trends. So I think that we\u2019re I guess satisfied with that business in terms of - well, obviously, we'd love to have more, but I don't think there is anything material to report in the upmarket. Tien- tsin Huang : Thank you for that. And then just on the PEO, just one question there, just with I guess Paychex, they\u2019ve introduced minimum premium plan and I guess TriNet is also looking to make some changes in how they handle the risk side of insurance. Given all these changes, does that create share opportunity for ADP and are you considering making some changes as well, I'm assuming not, but I figured that out, given some of the changes happening in the marketplace? Carlos Rodriguez : I think we\u2019re always looking at all of our options, but there is no current plans to make any changes and we have really no way of knowing what competitive impact it's going to have in terms of what other people are doing. Tien- tsin Huang : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon from Baird. Mark Marcon : Good morning and thanks for taking my questions as well. Just on the PEO side, you mentioned that half of the clients are basically existing payroll clients. Can you describe a little bit how much more profitable or what the revenue uptick is when we typically go through a conversion from a payroll centric to a more comprehensive PEO solution? Carlos Rodriguez : Excluding pass-throughs, it obviously depends on what the client had when they were a payroll client and depends on what the pricing is when they become a PEO client, but you can think of the range being between 8 and 10 times multiple of revenue on a net basis, excluding pass-throughs. Mark Marcon : That's great. And then - when we talk about the new bookings, how much of the new bookings is from upsells of either modules or versus brand-new clients? Jan Siegmund : Mark, historically, our mix has been 50-50, about 50% of bookings roughly towards new client counts and logos and 50% of upsell. And but obviously at the elevated levels of ACA selling, the mix has shifted a little bit because most of the ACA has been really selling to our existing client base. So in the current year, that mix is a little shifted, but as we indicated without ACA, we would have grown with our long-term expectation of new business bookings going up 8% to 10% for that component that roughly holds in line. Mark Marcon : Great. And then you mentioned 14,000 clients using you for the ACA, can you give us a percentage of the core target there in terms of the companies, above 50 employees, but not overly huge that are using you for the ACA, like how far penetrated are you? Jan Siegmund : I think we have captured about half of the opportunity in total. At the large market, this is a smaller number. So at these ranges, it doesn't really make that big of a difference to include them or not include them. So I think we have captured about half the opportunity. Sara Grilliot : We have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our final question for today comes from the line of Jim Macdonald from First Analysis. Jim Macdonald : Yeah. Thanks for squeezing me in. With the fall selling season over, could you talk about if there are any qualitative differences, like more active than normal or people frozen because of the ACA or? Carlos Rodriguez : I think based on our results, excitement would be the qualitative description. Jim Macdonald : Okay. So you are at success. And then you mentioned that the ACA revenue would be more felt in the third quarter and that was maybe for the modules. I know you\u2019ve been charging monthly to some people, could you just talk about how the revenue from ACA will dovetail in? Jan Siegmund : Yes. It is a monthly per employee charge that the clients start to incur with really January or February, depending on when they launch their product. So you will see the full swing of our implementations that we finished in December into January by building up, and that's basically reflected in our revenue guidance as Carlos indicated we will reach kind of by the end of the year the double-digit revenue growth, 10% revenue growth if you adjust for FX impact of the AdvancedMD business. So you will see it kind of from our current organic growth rate accelerating to those levels in order for us to make the full-year guidance. Jim Macdonald : Okay, thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos Rodriguez : So thank you all for joining the call today. We\u2019re obviously halfway through this fiscal year and I think we\u2019ve described some of the challenges we still have ahead of us, but obviously we\u2019re very happy with the progress we've made. I don't usually use the word, exciting, but I just used it in the last question to describe how we feel about our new business bookings growth. Clearly getting some help from ACA compliance, but it\u2019s really an incredible achievement to have the kind of bookings growth that we have this year on top of what we had last year. I want also just to remind the folks on the call that we still remain committed to the shareholder friendly option that we've always been committed to around share repurchases and increasing our dividend. And I want to end by, besides thanking all of you for joining us and thanking you for your interest in ADP, I just want to end by saying that there has always been a strong work ethic here at ADP. But over the last 12 months, it has been a very challenging environment for our associates with the ACA rollout and some of the challenges we've had around our resource constraints. So, I once again would like to thank all of our associates for their dedication to ADP and more importantly to our clients. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a good day.",

Davis - JPMorgan Securities LLC Unknown Speaker : 6MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION Operator : Good morning. My name is Cat and I will be your conference operator. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Third Quarter Fiscal 2016 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Ms. Sara Grilliot, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Sara Grilliot - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. This is Sara Grilliot, ADP's Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call and Webcast. During our call today we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures which we believe to be useful to investors. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. Before Carlos begins with a discussion of the quarter's results, I'd like to remind everybody that today's call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. So now let me turn the call over to Carlos. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you, Sara, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call and for your continued interest in ADP. This morning we reported results for our third quarter of fiscal 2016 which included revenue growth of 7%, or 9%, excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation. In addition to this solid revenue growth, we continue to see strong demand for our solutions which is evidenced by our new business bookings growth of 13%. While sales of additional Human Capital Management modules that assist with the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, compliance continue to boost our performance, we are especially pleased to see balanced growth contribution across our HCM portfolio. From further penetration of new applications into our base, to growth in the number of clients choosing our higher touch HR outsourcing models, we are seeing continued traction for our technology solutions and our robust service offerings. During the quarter, ADP continued to focus on implementation of solutions that support ACA reporting requirements in the U.S. At the end of March, employers with 50 or more employees were required to send form 1095-C to each of their employees describing the health insurance available to them. This is the most significant employee tax filing form introduced by the U.S. government since the W-2 more than 70 years ago and it is significantly more complex for the employer to deliver. More than 25,000 clients ranging in size from 50 to 50,000 employees trusted ADP to assist them with ACA. As of March 31, ADP delivered nearly 10 million Form 1095-Cs to these client employees. This endeavor was no small task. To put it in perspective, ADP processed nearly 60 million W-2 forms for the 2015 tax year, a form we have been producing for decades. The W-2 requires one system of record, the payroll system, and is therefore significantly easier to produce than the 1095-C which can require data from multiple sources. So as you may imagine, producing 10 million form 1095-Cs in the first reporting year of these new regulations was demanding for us and required a strong partnership with our clients. This is another example of the breadth of our capabilities in the complex world of workforce compliance, and I am very proud of the work our teams have done and will continue to do to help these clients navigate the uncharted waters of ACA reporting. ADP's global capabilities also continue to be a differentiator for us. ADP first began offering global payroll services more than a decade ago, and we have continuously expanded our offering across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific and the Americas. Last month we announced the expansion of our capabilities to seven additional locations including Angola, Tanzania and Zambia. Now in 111 countries around the globe, ADP is bringing our global clients the benefits of integrated payroll solutions from a provider they trust. This ability to support the payroll compliance needs of global firms managing businesses in locales with constant changes in the legal and regulatory landscape is incredibly powerful and unrivaled in our industry. Now I'd like to give you an update on client retention. In the third quarter, ADP experienced a decline in retention of 30 basis points. We do believe the sequential improvement is a result of actions we have taken to strengthen our service capabilities. The talented professionals we have added to our service teams are now supporting our clients, and although we have an easier year-over-year comparison, we expect the client experience to continue to improve as these associates gain more experience. Aside from our clients' interactions with ADP through service and implementation, a key component of the client experience is our technology. We believe that our strategic platforms deliver best-in-class HCM capabilities in each of the markets they serve, and clients on these platforms generally have higher retention rates than those on our mature technology. So we are continuing to focus on upgrading clients to our modern cloud solutions. As we have previously discussed, we intentionally slowed the pace of migrations in recent months so we could best assist our clients with ACA compliance. With additional talent in place and the effort of ACA reporting beginning to slow, we intend to return to a migration pace that will enable us to complete our mid-market upgrades to the latest version of Workforce Now by the end of fiscal year 2017, which is in line with our previous expectations. Upgrading clients from mature technology is an important element for our strategy and the right thing for our clients. Positive external recognition further bolsters our confidence in our product and service offering. Earlier this quarter we announced that Everest Group has once again named us a Leader and Star Performer in its annual Everest Group PEAK Matrix for Multi-Process HR Outsourcing Providers. The report cites the number of new deals, expanded global service delivery, success of our mobile solutions and the introduction of our analytics and big data solution called ADP DataCloud as evidence of ADP's continued commitment to providing an enriched scope of solutions to our global clients. It's flattering when influencers recognize our strategic progress, but it's even more rewarding when clients do. I recently had the opportunity to spend time with many clients at our annual ADP Meeting of the Minds conference which we just held in Washington D.C. Each year we use this opportunity to update our clients on our developments and share where we are headed while listening and learning more about their challenges. What's clear is that these are challenging times for payroll and HCM professionals. ACA, globalization, regulatory complexity, the fight for top talent and changing workforce dynamics are all having a profound impact on how HR is practiced. We have built our business to help clients through these challenges and many others. We are unique in our ability to deliver capabilities across the HCM spectrum from recruitment through retirement, for businesses of all sizes around the entire globe. This was on display at Meeting of the Minds, and the client response to our progress was gratifying. And so with that, I'll turn the call over to Jan for a further review of our third quarter results. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, ADP revenues grew 7% or 9% on a constant dollar basis. This solid revenue growth was driven by net new additions to our recurring revenue stream, including the impact of ACA-related revenue, which began contributing to our growth in the third quarter. Earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, grew 9% or 10% on a constant dollar basis. This growth, while stronger than the first half of the fiscal year, continues to reflect additional costs related to selling expenses and incremental operational resources in support of new business sold. EBIT margin increased about 40 basis points compared to 24.4% in last year's third quarter. Diluted earnings per share grew 14% to $1.17, and reflected a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. In addition to delivering this solid operating performance, we have paid more than $700 million in dividends and returned more than $1 billion through share repurchases in the first three quarters of this fiscal year. In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 5% for the quarter or 7% on a constant dollar basis. As Carlos discussed, client revenue retention decreased 30 basis points in the third quarter, and we remain focused on actions that will improve this metric. Our same stores pays per control in the U.S. grew 2.5% and average client fund balances grew 2% compared to a year ago or 3% on a constant dollar basis. On a year-to-date basis we have seen a relative slowing in our pays per control metric compared with the 3% growth last year, which we believe is consistent with the U.S. economy reaching high employment levels. As a result of improving employment, we continue to see declines in state unemployment insurance collections, which have had a drag on client fund balances but at a lesser rate than last year. This, in combination with a weaker bonus season and the impact from client losses experienced in the first half, has put added pressure on the growth of our client fund balances for the quarter. Our business outside the U.S. continues to perform well driven by the strength of our multinational solutions, which serve businesses of all size from small and mid-market clients to very large global corporations. Employer Services segment margin declined about 40 basis points for the third quarter. This decline resulted from the impact of planned investments made in operational resources to implement the strong volume of new business sold over the last few quarters. ADP's PEO posted another quarter of strong performance, with third quarter revenue growth of 16% and growth in the average work site employees of 14%. The PEO also delivered solid margin expansion of approximately 50 basis points in the third quarter, driven primarily by operating and selling efficiencies as we continue to see good execution and increased productivity. I'm pleased with the progress we have made, and will now give you an update on our expectations for fiscal year 2016. For the fiscal year, ADP still expects revenue growth of about 7% or 9% on a constant dollar basis. As a reminder, this forecast includes almost 1 percentage point of expected pressure from the sale of the AdvancedMD business, which occurred towards the end of the first fiscal quarter. For the Employer Services segment, consistent with our prior forecast, revenue growth is anticipated to be 4% to 5% or 7% on a constant dollar basis. For the PEO, ADP is now anticipating revenue growth of about 17% compared with our prior forecast range of 16% to 18%. Our forecast for adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 50 basis points is unchanged. We're now expecting Employer Services margin expansion up about 50 basis points compared with our prior forecasted margin expansion of about 75 basis points. Margin in the PEO is now expected to expand up to 75 basis points compared with our prior forecast of about 50 basis points. We have narrowed our forecast for average client fund balances and are now expecting 3% growth or 4% on a constant dollar basis. We also now expecting growth in client funds interest revenue to be about flat to last year compared with our prior forecasted increase of up to $5 million. This is the result of the lower interest rate environment from the softening of the global economy. The total impact from the client funds extended investment strategy is still expected to be about flat compared to the $419 million in fiscal year 2015. The details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. Adjusted diluted earnings per share are now expected to grow about 12% from the $2.89 in fiscal year 2015 compared with our prior forecasted growth range of 11% to 13%. On a constant dollar basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow about 13% compared with our prior forecasted growth range of 12% to 14%. And with that, I now will turn it over to the operator to take your questions. Operator :  Our first question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could give us an update on the improved client retention methods \u2013 rates that you saw in the quarter. Can you maybe talk about how much the rate of implementation slowed versus the prior quarter? You talked about the slowing there. And maybe give us an update on in the mid-market I think you talked about 75,000 total clients and 45,000 on Work Force Now. Maybe an update on that 45,000 number, please? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Sure. I'll let Jan maybe put in a couple of stats also. But the \u2013 when \u2013 the slowdown in implementations was really around migrations, just to be clear. And I think after the first quarter, I think we mentioned that we had begun already to slow down some of our migrations. Now there continued to be some scheduled migrations that spilled over into the second quarter, so it was really toward the end of the second quarter, our fiscal second quarter, that we began to truly try to focus more on stabilizing our service organization and also our ACA implementations. And hence, this third leg that was putting pressure on us, and the third leg of the stool which is an important part of our strategy, but we felt like we could in the short-term slowdown in order to take pressure off of ourselves is what we did around the slowdown in the migration. And that's exactly what happened. To put it in perspective, in the first quarter of the year our migrations were more than double at the same rate of the previous year's first quarter. We still did some migrations here in the third quarter, but I would say it was very, very low rates. And we got the desired impact, which is it allowed us to focus on the other things that we had from a volume standpoint on ACA, and also trying to redirect some of those resources to stabilizing our service environment. So I think that was \u2013 we did exactly what we had planned to do, and I think what we communicated, and I think we got the desired result. As I mentioned in the first and second quarter, there's no scientific way to know how much each of those three things was putting pressure individually on our retention and our client service experience, but we basically had one that we had very \u2013 a lot of control over which is migrations, and we decided to slow it. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Maybe I'll add on the migration pace, Jim, for you. I think we migrated in March; we resumed the migrations, and I think it's in the thousand range. So the number of clients on the latest version for Workforce Now has not changed materially really compared to our last update. But we are still expecting to really complete the overall migrations in our mid-market onto Workforce Now to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2017, as we had always planned for. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's very helpful color. Thanks. And then maybe as a quick follow up. Can you give us an update on the migrations you're seeing in the up-market? Any rough metrics in terms of percentage of clients completed on that side? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think in the up-market, it's probably more a discussion around number of clients rather than percentages because I think it's just the nature of the business. And I think there we are, I think, moving ahead with plans in terms of a similar strategy to what we've had in the down-market and in the mid-market which is to get our clients onto our strategic platforms over time. But I think as we've said over the last couple of quarters, I think it's probably not helpful. And given that these are very identifiable clients, everyone knows who their names are, and most of our competitors know what platforms they're on, we don't believe that it's going to be fruitful and useful to get into a lot of detail around our schedules and which platforms and which clients we're migrating. But you should take from the message that Jan and I just delivered on the previous question that you asked that we still believe this is the right thing to do, and the slowdown in the mid-market was really just related to all of the other moving parts that we had, not because we believe it's the wrong thing to do. So we're still on the same strategy. It's I think consistent with prior quarters. We believe that the migrations and the upgrades in the up-market are going to take longer than they have taken in the down-market and in the mid-market, but we're comfortable with that because that's just a different nature of the business in the up-market. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Good morning. It's great to see the retention trend improving. Do you have any concern that it could get worse again as you ramp back up the migrations that have been slowed? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Obviously, like, one of the \u2013 as you know, new business bookings and retention are the two numbers that are not \"recurring revenue.\" So our business model is actually very stable, very predictable. And those two numbers are also relatively stable and relatively predictable, but they have more variability than the rest of our numbers. So we never try to forecast quarter to quarter or future quarters on either new business bookings or client retention for that reason. So it's clearly a possibility, but it's not our plan. And so you can tell by our desire or actually our actions to reignite our migrations that we don't believe that that will be the case, and we believe that medium and longer term it's the right thing to do, which I think would lead you to the conclusion that the other factors like the high volumes of ACA and some of the service challenges we had around \u2013 which were related to ACA implementations and high volumes, the issues around inadequate service capabilities, I think, were also factors that contributed to our retention issues. And we don't think that it was only because of the client migrations, otherwise we obviously wouldn't be \u2013 we would be probably following a different path. So I think we're confident that it's still the right thing to do. As you know, we had had been doing migrations for several years and had not had the same kinds of issues that we experienced over the past couple of quarters with regards to retention. So I think, again, no scientific evidence, but I think we have a lot of ways of triangulating to the point where we think it's fundamentally the right thing to do. We end up having more \u2013 higher attach rates for our HCM modules. Our retention rates right now are higher on our strategic platforms than our legacy platforms. There's a lot of reasons that point to the need and I think the advantages of continuing with the migration strategy. Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Thanks. And then turning to margins, the ES guidance on margins suggests a pretty significant ramp year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Is that just the leverage on hires that you have already made? And are you now fully staffed up to higher migration in new sales, or should we expect to see that come up more? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah, I think you're pointing out to one element as now the revenue stream of the incremental revenues gets really a full quarter. So you could see that. See that implicit revenue acceleration in the fourth quarter when you dissect our full-year guidance that we confirmed. That will help. And secondly, the most important factor is in the fourth quarter, we are anticipating -we have a high investments of selling expense in the last year's fourth quarter and an easier grow-over. So with the confirmation of our new business bookings growth of 12%, you can also see that we're not anticipating mathematically a blowout fourth quarter just because of that difficult grow-over, and that will help on the margins. Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is open. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. I'm wondering if we could just talk a little bit about just the character of the business and how it's evolving. So given that the client base is mixing the bundled solutions, specifically ACA and PEO, since they're presumably growing at faster rates, should we be thinking any differently about how those clients scale differently than the traditional payroll business has over time? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Sorry. How those clients scale \u2013 in terms of...? Can you be a bit more ...? David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Well, I was thinking that since the ... Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: (23:26) David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I'm sorry? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Is this directed towards margin? David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Well, I was thinking more in terms of revenue growth, but you could include margin as well. But I was just thinking that because they're buying more that is, say, for example their pays for control increase, that this business may scale a little bit differently than the traditional payroll business had grown. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think we have been, I think, communicating, I think, for several quarters and I think it's still true that the products that we have that have the richest bundles, and it's not just PEO, but it's also our mid-market what we call ASO and basically our BPO HR outsourcing solutions, they're all growing faster than our core business, and they all have now, I think, very positive dynamics in terms of their margin. Not that you were asking specifically about margin, but they're also I think now at a size, all of them individually and collectively, where we're getting good contribution I think to our margin, certainly from a dollar standpoint and in many cases also from a margin percent standpoint. So I think that's why we like our position in terms of where we are around starting with our richest bundles, where it's really all-inclusive in terms of a full HCM bundle. The PEO is unique in the sense that it also has co-employment and provides healthcare and workers' comp. But some of our other very rich bundles also are very, very comprehensive and growing very robustly and scaling very well, and we've been able to handle those volumes and have gotten good leverage on the margin side. And then as you come down to our more traditional products, as we have also communicated there, whether it's in Vantage or Workforce Now or even in the down-market, the attach rates continue to be better on new business than the penetration of our products in the base. So I think that also bodes very well for us from a revenue growth standpoint, and also from a margin leverage standpoint. So we're \u2013 I think we're happy directionally with where we're going and where frankly the market is leading us, which is demand for these solutions is clearly high versus kind of the traditional simple standalone payroll solution. We do sell simple standalone payroll solutions, but I think the market is leading us in the direction of more comprehensive solutions. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you for that. And then just going back, I think there was a question earlier about the up-market market. And recognizing sales cycles are long, it's still early, but could you talk a little bit more about your experience thus far, and just help us understand better what the competitive dynamic is there, and where you're seeing success versus where there are some challenges as you approach that market? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Well, I think the competitive dynamic in the up-market is not terribly different than the competitive dynamic in the mid-market and in the down-market, which is that it's competitive, and there is a lot of competition. But we're pretty happy with the progress of our Vantage platform there in terms of new sales. And we mentioned that obviously we're going to be methodical and careful in terms of our upgrade cycle in the up-market, which I think fits naturally with the nature of that business anyway. So, I mean, as you know, we have been investing heavily in all of our products, including in the up-market. But that also goes for Workforce Now in the mid-market, and we have made some significant investments over the years in RUN which is our down-market platform. So it's hard to \u2013 I know it's a very specific question about the up-market, but it's hard for me to really single it out as having a different approach or a different strategy from the rest of our company because I don't think it is. I think it's we're on the same types of things. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: And maybe if I add from which will substantiate this with the color on our new business bookings, we really tried to say that we had a balanced growth in the quarter and have experienced that actually for the last few quarters, and so the up-market is participating in the sales acceleration that we have seen for this year. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Very good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Please go head. Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning. This is actually Jay Hanna on the line for Gary today. I was wondering if you could shed any light on why we haven't seen more revenue acceleration just given the strong bookings growth over the previous several quarters, in particular this quarter as retention declined and we started the new calendar year. Thank you. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah, I think, as usual, we have \u2013 you can probably mathematically as Jan probably has the math on the tip of his tongue, but I would tell you that just from an overall big picture standpoint, mathematically you can tell that the fourth quarter we have a decent amount of visibility given the nature of our business as to what is happening quarter to quarter, and I think the fourth quarter again when you exclude \u2013 which I think is the right way to do the comparison, you exclude the AdvancedMD comparable from the previous year, we don't have a lot of \u2013 I think in fact our current forecast is to not have much, if any, foreign currency effect in the fourth quarter. I think you normalize for all those things, and we're actually pretty happy with what our fourth quarter revenue growth implies. And then the third quarter I don't think we were \u2013 it's not fair to say we were disappointed, because we are pretty happy. Whenever ADP's revenue growth incrementally moves up 1/2 percentage point to 1 percentage point, which is when you \u2013 again you normalize for AdvancedMD and you normalize for currency, that's what happened. That makes us very happy. Because in a recurring revenue model, in order to accomplish that, you have to, as you just pointed out, you have to have strong new business starts, not just bookings, and you have to have either stable or improving retention. And that's exactly what we got. There may have been a little bit of calendar noise and a couple of other things in the third quarter that we don't see in the fourth quarter happening, and so we were actually pretty satisfied with kind of where we are, assuming that all of these things kind of hold that we have just communicated. Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And if I can get one more in. I'm just wondering given the strong bookings growth related to the ACA offering. When that begins to slow, should we expect an overhang from that as that service offering kind of begins to fall off (30:23) begins to drop? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think that that was something that I communicated in last quarter's call, which is again based on our kind of sense of the business, our experience and our knowledge, it's safe to assume that if we have sold call it approximately half of the addressable market on ACA, we believe there is still a lot of opportunity in our client base. But obviously now it's half the opportunity that we had had in the previous year. What we don't know yet is how people will react in terms of demand, because right now everybody is focused on getting the June deadline past them, in terms of the employer portion of the reporting which is the 1094. So it's really a little early for us to know exactly how much ACA demand we will or we will not have. And we've been very very transparent and very clear that it has provided tailwind. However, we have also been very clear that we would be satisfied and happy to communicate our sales results both for the quarter and the year to date excluding ACA. And that communication would lead you to believe that excluding ACA we'd be in the neighborhood of our long-term guidance around new business bookings. And so we believe this has been incremental. We hope we will get more of it next year. But clearly the mathematics are such that it's going to create \u2013 I wouldn't call it a hangover or an overhang, but I would call it a very difficult compare that we as we get further along in the next couple quarters will be able to hopefully communicate a little bit more clearly in terms of what that exactly means when we provide guidance for the next fiscal year. Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thank you for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rick Eskelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. The question is just going back to margins. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about sort of the longer term margin drivers with you altering the outlook for the two segments here on the margin side. Has anything changed longer term and more fundamentally? Do you see fewer opportunities in the Employer Services and more in the PEO on the margin front specifically? Thank you. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: No, we don't. I think that again when we have the kind of new business bookings growth that we have, because of the way our P&L works around implementation expense and commissions and selling expense, it puts a lot of pressure. So honestly I would probably say that I'm incredibly proud of the organization's ability to despite a very big ramp-up of expenses, some of which was related obviously to ACA both around new business bookings cost as well as implementation expense, I'm actually quite proud of the organization's ability to deliver based on our forecast for the fourth quarter what will be some margin improvement that is still kind of in the neighborhood of our long-term guidance. So I think that leads me to believe that even though we still have a lot of investment we want to make in the business, I want to be very, very clear that we are managing all of the variables in our business, including the need to continue to invest in our technology, in our associates, and in a number of things. But if in fact, as Jan said, if the fourth quarter our new business bookings growth because of the grow-over the previous year is smaller, that takes pressure off of us from a margin standpoint. The same would apply to next year if \u2013 we're not providing guidance in terms of our new business bookings growth for the next year, but mathematically, if we get back into the long-term range of our new business bookings, that will also provide tailwind and help take pressure off of our margin. So again, without getting \u2013 I mean, I could go on for a long time in terms of how our business model works. But we feel pretty good in fact this year I think would give us a high degree of encouragement. It was hard, and people worked very, very hard on controlling all controllable expenses in order to still deliver the kind of margin improvement we are in the face of the increased costs we had. But it just shows the power of the business model, and I think the ability of the company to leverage its revenue growth. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Then just following up, just on the staffing up you did in this past quarter, just curious if you are fully staffed or completely right-staffed for the migrations and the efforts, or if there is still more incremental hiring to do? Thank you. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think one of the comments I made in my opening statement was around the \u2013 what we're looking forward to is we have added a lot of additional resources that are in the process of ramping up. In other words, going through training and frankly it's not just about training because that's a relatively short process, but it's just the way it works probably in most companies that obviously as a person becomes more tenured they become more effective and more productive. And so we do expect to have continued help from the resources that we have added. But in terms of head count, in terms of FP head count, we believe we are fully staffed and that we are where we wanted to be at this point. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Danyal Hussain with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, Carlos and Jan. Thanks for taking the question. Can you just talk about how the improvement in retention came in versus your expectations when you first set out and took action to address it? And at this point, do you still have a backlog for ACA implementation or are you fully caught up? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah, so first a disclaimer. As retention fluctuates over the quarter and has seasonality in it and changes, so we generally think about it as a longer term type of trend. And I would say that the third quarter was right in line with our expected improvements for our full year expectations. So we just made the progress that we expected, and within the forecasting uncertainty that there is, we came kind of right out in that range. So we're pretty happy about that. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: You had a second part of your question? Do you mind repeating it? Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes. It was just on the backlog that you had in the implementation. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: We're still implementing ACA solutions. We have sold some ACA solutions for the next year. So \u2013 and we're working on completing the delivery of the product, which centers around the employee-employer part of the portion of ACA. So they're still in high gear. They're reaching out to clients. They're connecting, making sure that everything is going well. So that activity it has stabilized obviously, and the big push of the March deadline is behind us. But this is just going to be now part of our regular business. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then a second question is just on PEO. The spread between revenue growth and the average work site employee growth, it narrowed a bit in the quarter. So just wondering if there was deceleration of medical inflation or other pass-through taxes? Or is there... Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: (37:47) mathematically, that's actually an astute observation. The answer is actually related to my comment that we had in the balance growth comments of my portion. Unemployment Insurance rates have declined, and so as a consequence of that, the pass-through of that 38 :07) rate has diminished the total revenue growth versus the processing revenue growth. So that's the biggest factor. A number of ins and outs. But nothing other structurally changing. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think without getting into the weeds, the state employment that Jan is referring to, which affects our balances, and also affects the PEO, is a tax that gets capped fairly early, depending on obviously your wage, but it tends to be a first quarter phenomenon. So, again, we don't provide quarter to quarter guidance, but if you were to see that narrowing that you observed would be more pronounced in the first quarter than... Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: In the first calendar quarter... Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: ... first calendar quarter, sorry, than it would be going forward, just to help a little bit there. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks so much. I don't think anybody has asked about the pricing environment yet so let me be the first to ask that question. How has it changed if at all over the past quarter or so? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah, we were expecting the question, and we have really no news to report. It is really unchanged. We are continuing with price increases of less than 1% in our revenue growth so we're executing against our long-term vision of price increases, also discounting environment is similar. It varies by segment a little bit over quarters and how we manage our sales force. But no structural change in the pricing environment. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think that's probably a good place also to mention because this is a question that we've gotten a couple times in the last couple quarters, given the client retention questions that, again, Jan and I spend a lot of time particularly when we have a full quarter to look at and then at the year to date numbers around wins and losses and competitors and so forth. And I think I was very, very clear that we have a lot of competition in every segment of our market, but we really don't have anything to report in terms of any major changes around individual competitors or, as Jan alluded to, people changing their approach based on pricing or other factors. So it's all kind of normal course and speed if you will, but with a lot of competition, obviously, which we've had for a number of years. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Great. And on to an obscure question on taxes. We noticed that you lowered your guidance for tax rates. I know it came in a little bit lower than expected for the quarter you just reported. Can you just give us a little color what's going on there, and should that be the new tax rate we use longer term? Thanks so much. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: No, you should not. These were one-time items that were actually in this case related to our prior bigger transactions on divestitures and the spin, so we just identified a little bit more opportunity that came in and that we hadn't forecasted. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Appreciate that. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Your line is open. Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC : Sure. This is Ramsey El-Assal standing in for Jason. When we look at the new business bookings, the healthy growth in new business bookings, how much of this is new business to payroll PEO versus competitive takeaways or versus cross-sell? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: So the mix of our new business bookings is relatively stable, and it \u2013 for the total new business bookings picture is 50-50 approximately. So 50% of our new business bookings is generated by capturing new clients, and about 50% is generated by selling more product to our existing clients. Secondly, I think in detail, we don't disclose the sales volume, our new business bookings volume to our PEO, but we have also in prior calls disclosed that about half of our business to the PEO is new clients and about half of the business comes from existing ADP clients that fuel the overall growth of the PEO. So we have kind these rules of 50-50 and they apply consistently and move actually very little quarter over quarter. Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And then in your Employer Services revenue, what percentage is now non-U.S.? Has that split between Canada, Europe, and other geographies changed? And I'm just trying to get an idea sort of as well in terms of whether there's been any shift in terms of the currencies you're exposed to, granted you're expanding pretty dramatically across the globe. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Since Carlos hasn't, let me answer that sub-question. Carlos mentioned it, but we don't currently at current rates, we don't expect FX pressure for the fourth quarter. A little less than 20% of our revenues are international revenues. That has been fairly stable over the last many years actually. And our largest exposure is the euro and the Canadian dollar. Those are the majority that you would want to watch. Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephanie Davis with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Stephanie J. Davis - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I know we have addressed this a bit for the mid-market, but can you talk to the mix of cloud versus legacy clients on a total company basis? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think on a client percentage basis, I think we were always \u2013 been careful to make sure that we communicate very clearly on this. Because we've moved all of our down-market clients onto our cloud solution, and that's close to 450,000 clients. So in terms of number of clients, we have about 500,000 clients that are on our cloud products, which are our strategic platforms. So percentage-wise, it's a very high percentage of our clients. But clearly from a revenue standpoint, that would be different because our small client's average revenue per client is much lower than our mid-market or our up-market. So I think, down-market a hundred percent of our clients, around 450,000, are on cloud. In the mid-market, we have probably over 60% or so of our clients on our strategic cloud solution. And then in the up-market, I don't have that percentage offhand, and again that's one where you really look at it on a client by client basis. But I think that gives you a little bit of a flavor of kind of where we are. Our plan obviously is to continue the upgrades in order to continue to drive those percentages higher, but that gives you maybe a little bit of color. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yes, I think that's about it. Stephanie J. Davis - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. Thank you for the color. Just one follow up on the retention side. With some macro employment improvements and the migration push, are you seeing any structural shifts in voluntary versus involuntary attrition mix? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: We do monitor the factors that are cause for our retention, and if you take a multi-year look, which I think if you want to look at the economic factors that impact our retention, SPS is most affected by these economic factors new business foundation and other business are impacting our ability to sell and impacting our retention rate in SPS, and we had excellent retention rates in the down-market, partially aided by this improvement of the business environment overall. That has been fairly stable for the last three quarters, and so we have not seen a big change in it. Our comments regarding high employment and the economy were more geared as a general notion to the expectations that we've had a very long positive economic cycle, and we see overall for the business potentially a slight slowing from a still growing trend basically. So it's a very nuanced comment that we wanted to make it's so ever so slightly we're coming closer to what some people would describe as a full employment in the economy. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: And the comments were really more around pays per control growth rather than client retention. Even though I think as Jan was alluding to, obviously as the economic cycle matures, at some point there might be an impact on client retention. But for today, I think our comments were really directed at our pays per control growth, because I think the math is very clear there. So what we have seen in past economic cycles is you could possibly go for a few years with a kind of full-ish employment type of situation which then impacts pays per control, but doesn't necessarily impact client retention. But clearly if the economic cycle turns, you know, we have been very clear and very transparent around how our business model works, particularly in a down-market, a negative economic cycle has negative impact on our client retention. Stephanie J. Davis - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude today's Q&A portion of the call. I'm pleased to hand the program back over to Carlos Rodriguez for any closing remarks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I want to thank you for participating today. I just want to reiterate how proud I am of the organization's ability to get our solutions implemented on ACA compliance. Other than back to Y2K during my tenure here at ADP, this has been probably the most challenging time in terms of need to ramp up resources in terms of implementation and service and be able to absorb the new business bookings that we have had over the last several years. That was a lot of hard work and a lot of dedication on the part of a lot of associates, and I want to thank them specifically for everything that they did for our clients. It's \u2013 I don't know if it was clear in the call today, but when you look at our strong new business bookings, which now when you look at the compounded growth rate over the last five or six years in double digits coupled with the improving trend on retention, what we've been able to do in terms of these ACA implementations, and despite all that deliver decent margin improvement, it's really a lot to be proud of. So I want to thank all the associates across all of ADP for their hard work and contribution to the success that we had this quarter. And I want to thank all of you for joining us today, and I want to thank you for your interest in ADP. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Fourth Quarter FY \u201816 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the conference over to Miss Sara Grilliot, Vice President of Investor or Relations. Please go ahead. Sara Grilliot : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. This is Sara Grilliot, ADP's Vice President Investor Relations and I'm here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter FY '16 earnings call and webcast. Before we begin, you may have noticed in the slide presentation posted on our website that we included the detail of our client funds available for sale portfolios as of June 30th, 2016 which shows the embedded book yields of the portfolio by year of maturity. This is chart is in the appendix of the presentation and is provided for your information. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures which we believe to be useful to investors. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and in the supplemental sides on our Investor Relations website. Before Carlos begins, I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filing with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Now let me turn the call over to Carlos. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you, Sara and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining our call and for your continued interest in ADP. This morning we reported solid results for the fourth quarter and full FY '16, with revenue up 8% for the quarter and 7% for the year. Excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation, FY '16 revenue grew 8%. Please keep in mind that our 8% growth in FY '16 was negatively impacted by about 1% from the sale of our AdvancedMD business which occurred at the end of the first fiscal quarter. In addition to the solid FY '16 revenue growth, I'm very pleased with the robust new business bookings results we experienced during FY '16, posting 12% growth for the year. This represents $1.75 billion in new recurring revenue generated by our sales force during the fiscal year. Strong sales of human capital management modules that assist clients in complying with the Affordable Care Act contributed meaningfully to the out performance we've seen in new business bookings for the past two fiscal years. This important regulatory change impacted the ATM industry in material ways. ADP responded well and sold our ACA compliance solutions to about half of our addressable base in a relatively short period of time. Because of this very strong recent performance and the resulting difficult compare, we expect FY '17 new business bookings to grow 4% to 6% from the $1.75 billion sold in FY '16. If achieved this will result in a three year compounded annual growth rate of 9% which is within our long-term expected range of 8% to 10%. FY '16 was an exciting year that showcased ADP's agility as we continued to adapt to the dynamic needs of our clients. When we look back at our progress, it's clear that the long-term trends we see with respect to the changing nature of how work is done, the increasing complexity of regulatory compliance, the trend toward harnessing the power of big data and HR and the need to work seamlessly across geographic boarders are all having positive impacts on our success. We've responded to these trends in many ways during the year. For example, across the portfolio, we've dramatically improved the user experience of our clients' employees. In doing so, we've made our products easier to use and more consistent with how employees engage with consumer technology and social media. If your company is an ADP client, I invite you to join the more than eight million users of ADP's mobile app to experience this for yourself. We've leveraged our unique data set of 26 billion payroll records to introduce significant new data analytics capabilities. Since introducing ADP DataCloud just over one year ago, we now have more than 2500 clients using this solution to generate actionable insights that help address work force productivity, contribute to talent development and assist with employee retention. We've expanded our capabilities geographically and can now meet the payroll processing and compliance needs of companies with operations in more than 110 countries and territories which is a key differentiator in our industry. And we've met the challenges presented by the implementation of the Affordable Care Act in the U.S. With strong demand for our ACA solutions, we made investments in operational resources and successfully helped more than 25,000 clients process more than 10 million form 1095-Cs, the most significant new employee tax form introduced by the IRS since the W-2. As we've discussed, we believe our investments to innovate and simplify our portfolio are essential for our long-term success. We believe our strategic platforms now deliver best-in-class HCM capabilities in each of the markets they serve and we've seen solid retention rates from clients on our strategic platforms. Therefore, continuing to upgrade clients to our modern cloud solutions remains a critical area of focus for us and is the right thing to do for our clients. Today, all of our small business clients are on the RUN platform and during the fourth quarter we increased the pace of our client migrations in the mid-market and now have about 49,000 clients on the latest versions of Workforce Now. With 2/3 of this base now upgraded, we expect the balance of our Workforce Now clients to be transitioned to the current platform by the end of FY '17. As we continue to move clients onto our strategic platforms and have more clients engaging ADP for multiple services across the HCM spectrum, we're embarking on a path to simplify our service model for our associates and our clients. Over the past several years, our technology platforms have evolved to meet the dynamic needs of our clients, who are choosing to engage in a more comprehensive way with their HCM providers. As a result of this shift, a new approach to service is essential to support the HCM Company that we've become and extend our leadership in this growing market and I'm therefore excited to tell you about a service initiative we're kicking off in FY '17. This new initiative is designed to better align our service organization to work across traditional lines, leverage best-in-class service tools and processes and establish teams with expertise across the HCM spectrum. We believe this will enhance the client experience and at the same time allow us to better transfer knowledge among these service teams and offer robust career opportunities within the service organization, all of which benefits our clients and our associates. As we begin to build out this new service model, we believe there's a benefit to be gained by collocating certain U.S. service capabilities at existing and new ADP locations in the U.S. that have the scale to support the strategy. We have had positive experiences creating centers like these at sites such as El Paso, Texas; Augusta, Georgia; among other places. We've recently selected Norfolk, Virginia and Maitland, Florida, near Orlando, as our next two locations and have started building cross-functional service teams at both sites. We will announce a third new site in the western part of the U.S. later this year. As part of this initiative, we will focus on building service capabilities within these and our existing other locations while streamlining our geographic footprint. In connection with these efforts, ADP will be making certain investments in FY '17 which are expected to put some pressure on our margin expansion goals for the year. Jan will provide more detail when he reviews FY '17 outlook. However, we do expect our margin expansion in FY '17 to be lower than our long-term goal of 50 to 75 basis points as we make these important investments. Now let's spend a few moments on retention. During the fourth quarter, we experienced a retention decline of 80 basis points and for the full fiscal year, retention declined about 1 point to 90.5%. Similar to previous quarters, we continue to see a concentration of losses from clients who are still on legacy technology and while we have seen some of the benefits from investments we've made in service during the early part of FY '16, we continue to experience variability in our retention metric. In closing, FY '16 was an exciting and challenging year for ADP. We achieved strong revenue growth driven by sales of additional HCM modules to support clients with the new ACA requirements. We invested in implementation and operational resources to support this revenue growth while still delivering solid margin expansion and we did this while remaining consistent with our commitment to shareholder-friendly actions. During FY '16, we returned about $2.1 billion in cash through dividends and share repurchases and increased our dividend for the 41st consecutive year. I am confident that as we successfully execute against our strategy, we will continue to drive results for our clients, our associates and our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jan who will review our FY '16 financials and share our FY '17 outlook. Jan Siegmund : Thank you very much, Carlos and good morning everyone. During the fourth quarter, we took a severance charge of $48 million that was related to a broad-based workforce optimization effort. Certain non-GAAP measures and my commentary to follow exclude the impact of this charge, as well as certain other one-time items recognized earlier in the fiscal year. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found in this morning's press release and in the supplemental charts of our Investor Relations website. As Carlos mentioned, FY '16 was a successful year for ADP. New business bookings grew 12% to $1.75 billion sold. Revenues grew 7% to $11.7 billion. Excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation, revenues grew 8% for the year. On a reported basis, net earnings grew 8% and diluted earnings per share grew 12%. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT, grew 10% or 11% on a constant dollar basis. For the year, adjusted EBIT margin expanded 60 basis points from the 18.8% in FY '15. I'm pleased with this solid margin expansion which includes the impact of investments and operational resources that were made during the fiscal year as we supported our clients through the first year of the ACA related reporting requirements. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13% to $3.26, reflecting a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. In addition to delivering this solid operating performance, we have paid more than $900 million in dividends and returned about $1.2 billion through share repurchases for FY '16. During the fourth quarter, ADP returned $100 million to shareholders through share repurchases which was at a reduced pace compared with prior quarters. Market conditions were not a factor and our longstanding commitment to return cash to our shareholders remains unchanged. So now, for a discussion of our segment results. In our employee services segment, revenues grew 5% for the year or 6% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was driven by additions to new recurring revenues during the fiscal year from strong new business bookings sold. As Carlos discussed, client revenue retention decreased 80 basis points in the fourth quarter and for the year revenue retention declined about 1 point to 90.5%. Our same-store pace for control in the U.S. grew 2.5% for the fiscal year. Average client fund balances grew 3% for year or 4% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was slower than in prior years, primarily related to the declines of state unemployment insurance collections as the result of an improving labor market in the U.S. This, in combination with the impact from client losses experienced end of the year, has put added pressure on the client funds balance growth. Our business outside of North America continues to perform well despite an uncertain global environment. This performance is driven by continued strong demand for our multinational solutions which serve businesses of all sizes and are now the largest contributor to our sales outside of North America. Employee services segment margin increased about 60 basis points for the fiscal year. This increase was driven by reduced selling expenses in the fourth quarter compared to last year's fourth quarter, partially offset by the negative impact of planned investments made throughout the year to support our clients with the first year of ACA compliance. The PEO had a successful year, posting revenue growth of 16% and average worksite employee growth of 13%. Let me make a few comments about fourth quarter revenue growth in the PEO which trended lower at 13% growth compared with the previous three quarters in FY '16. This revenue growth deceleration was based on two factors. First, regarding our gross revenues which include pass-throughs, our clients experienced a favorable impact from lower healthcare renewal premiums during our fourth quarter which contributed to a lower relative gross in our pass-through revenues. Second, in the fourth quarter we noticed some variability in the timing of payrolls run by our clients. This type of timing variability has occurred in the past and should not be viewed as an indicator of any underlining change in the fundamentals of the business. We remain pleased with the performance of our PEO which had strong worksite employee growth of 13% and we're happy to see that the PEO also delivered strong margin expansion of approximately 70 basis points for FY '16 which was primarily driven by operating and selling efficiencies from increased productivity. This is solid overall performance for FY '16, with strong new business bookings yielding healthy revenue growth and solid margin expansion despite the initial investments we made during the year. I'm pleased with our results and will now take you through our expectations for FY '17. As Carlos mentioned, for FY '17, we're expecting new business bookings growth of 4% to 6%, from $1.75 billion sold in FY '16. We anticipate total revenue growth of 7% to 9% for the year which is not expected to be significantly impacted by foreign currency translation based on current rates. This forecast assumes 4% to 5% revenue growth in the employer services segment and growth in pays-per-control of 2.5%. Revenue growth for the PEO is expected to be 14% to 16%. ADP's adjusted EBIT margin is expected to it expand 25 to 50 basis points from the 19.5% in FY '16 which is below our goal of 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion over the longer run. We're still committed to this margin improvement goal over the longer term, but as Carlos mentioned, we're making investments in FY '17 to align our service model in support of our technology strategy. We expect these operational investments will put about 20 basis points of pressure on our FY '17 margins and as a result of these build-out of the new facilities, total expenditures/capital expenditures for FY '17, I expect it to be about $250 million. In addition to these investments, we also anticipate certain one-time charges of $100 million to $125 million throughout FY '18. Of this, $45 million is expected to be incurred during the first quarter of FY '17 and $45 million in the latter part of the year, with the remainder expected in FY '18. These charges are excluded from our FY '17 forecast for adjusted EBIT margin expansion and from our adjusted diluted earnings per share forecast. A reconciliation of these metrics can be found in this morning's press release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. On a segment level, we anticipate pretext margin expansion of about 50 basis points for employer services and 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion in the PEO. On a reported basis, diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 6% to 8% compared with the $3.25 FY '15. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 10% to 12% from the adjusted $3.26 in FY '16 and contemplates an adjusted effective tax rate of 33.3%, consistent with the 33.3% in FY '16. In accordance to our continued shareholder-friendly actions and our intention to return excess cash to shareholders, our earnings per share forecast assumes that excess cash of $1 billion to $1.4 billion will be returned via share repurchases during FY '17. This forecasted range includes anticipated share repurchases required to offset employee benefit plan issuance and the timing of these share repurchases is dependent upon market conditions. So with that, I will take you through our forecast for the client fund extended investment strategy. First, a reminder that the objectives of our investment strategy remain the safety, liquidity and diversification of our assets. As of the end of the fiscal year, approximately 80% of our fixed income portfolio was invested in AAA and AA-rated securities. In a typical year, our strategy results in about 15% to 20% of our fixed income investments maturing and this year we expect the percentage of maturities will be closer to the lower end of this range. We continue to base the interest rate assumptions in our forecast on the Fed funds future contracts for the clients' short and corporate cash portfolios. And the forward year curves of the three-and-a-half and five-year U.S. government agency forward year curves for the client and corporate extended and the client long portfolios, respectively. And as we do not believe it is possible to accurately predict future interest rates, the shape of the year curve and the new bond issuance behavior are corporate and other issuers. For FY '17, we anticipate growth in the average client funds balances of 2% to 4% from the $22.4 billion in FY '16. We anticipate that the yield of the client fund portfolio will remain about flat at 1.7%, compared with FY '16. These factors are expected to result in an increase of up to $5 million to client fund interest revenue. The total contribution from the client funds extended investment strategy is expected to be about flat to FY '17. The detail of this forecast is available in the supplemental slides on our website. And before we take your questions, I wanted to let you know that Sara will be taking a new role within ADP finance as a CFO of one of our business units. I want to thank Sara for her contributions leading our investor relations program and welcome our new Head of Investor Relations, Christian Greyenbuhl, who was recently -- who has recently led ADP's global accounting team. So with that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from the line of James Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. James Schneider : I was wondering if you could maybe give us an update on the migrations in the mid-market segment. I think you said 45,000 had already migrated. It sounds like maybe that's under 40,000 clients to go. Can you maybe talk about any changes you're seeing in terms of, as you make those migrations, whether you're seeing any kind of additional client losses and maybe you can just talk about the pace of migrations over the course of FY '17, whether that's going to be back or front-half loaded or just ratable over the course of the year? Carlos Rodriguez : Sure. I think the number was really 49,000 that have been migrated and I think we have about 25,000 to go. In terms of the other questions, you know, we did have some time to kind of reset how we were doing migrations and the pace also based on, you know, I mentioned that there were three factors that I think impacted our retention back over the last three quarters and we think one of them was the pace of migrations and also the execution around migrations. So a lot of work was done during what we call our year-end blackout because we really prefer not to do migrations anyway in the call it November to January, February time frame, because there are so many things going on at the calendar year-end in a typical HCM payroll company. And so that gave us a little bit of time for those folks to focus on kind of stabilizing that organization and rethinking what the proper pace is and to put it in perspective, we migrated approximately 4000 clients during the quarter. And when we experienced challenges with some of the migrations, we were up as high as 7000 in a quarter. This is back in the beginning of this fiscal year. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color and I think the overall comment is clearly I think our competitors are fishing in those waters, because we see it in the numbers in terms of our losses being concentrated in our legacy platforms. And we're trying to reduce the size of the fishing pond, so there's still some variability there in the retention. But I think we've gotten better at how we're doing the migrations and I think our pace is more manageable and I think easier for us to control at this point. Operator : Our next question from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. Your line is open. Christin Chen : This is Christin Chen for Jason. Thank you for taking my question. We were under the impression in FY '16, your bookings growth in excess of the traditional 8% to 10% range was mostly due to ACA. Just looking at the 4% to 6% for FY '17, it would imply a slowdown of, you know, kind of more than just what the tough comps from ACA would imply. Can you just talk about the things you're seeing or the underlying drivers behind that deceleration for this metric? Thanks. Carlos Rodriguez : Sure, I will let maybe Jan talk a little about the math, but I think the math does kind of work in within maybe 0.5 point to 1 point, one way or the other depending on your perspective. Because we don't provide exact numbers. But we want to reiterate that we had strong growth in new business bookings this year excluding, ACA. And then mathematically, what that creates is a grow-over for next year. I think I've previously said and we will say today that we don't expect the same level of new business bookings from ACA. Since we've already sold half of our addressable market, even if we assume that we sell half of the remaining half next year, that creates a mathematical grow-over issue for us. I'll let maybe Jan comment on the math. But I think the message you should hear from us is that we believe over the course of three years, as you can imagine, we look very carefully about, is the sales strength coming from core operations, is it coming from additional business, is it coming from ACA and we feel pretty good on a three-year compounded basis about where our new business bookings growth is right now. Jan Siegmund : Yes, thank you Carlos. And there are two different methods you can look at this, you could exclude the ACA impact on all three years and look at the underlining growth of the rest of our new business bookings. We would be delivering exactly what we have said are in-line with our long-term goals expectations of 8% to 10% over those three years. And you can also look at is the decline driven by a slowing of ACA sales in FY '17 and that is yes, because we have at rest already half of our business opportunity in the first year and we don't expect to close, cover 100% of the sales opportunity in FY '17. So we had to make assumptions about that and so both are in line within a percentage point plus, minus. So this is for government work, an estimate that keeps it intact. Carlos Rodriguez : Yes, I think more government work, again, these are not the right numbers, but mathematically if you take 4% out of the 12% it gives you 8%. And if you add 4% to the 4% to 6%, you get back to 8% to 9% and you're still within the 8% to 10% range. So I hate to be so simplistic, but I think that's really the way the math works. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Sara Gubins : The EF guidance for 4% to 5% revenue growth just slower growth in constant currency than what we've been seeing recently, in spite of the ACA bookings that you got this past year. Is that because of retention and could you give us any color on what kind of revenue you did get from ACA last year and what you're expecting for this coming year? Carlos Rodriguez : I think that the ES revenue growth has been accelerating for the last five years. And I think some of that obviously is driven by the economy, in terms of as the economy rebounded, I think we had some help in pace per control and a number of other factors and just the strong new business bookings growth has created a bigger gap between our starts, what we call our starts and our losses and I think that has contributed to this accelerating growth in employer services. I think you're right that the losses that we experienced this year obviously have an effect this year and they have an effect on the following year as well. But again, back to kind of simplistic math for government work, I think we're probably plus or minus 0.5 point in terms of ES revenue growth. So maybe some of that is rounding, but we don't feel any weakness, I guess, to be clear. And the ACA revenues, Jan probably has the exact number, that clearly provided lift in our new business bookings and does provide lift to revenues that then also presents somewhat of a grow-over. It's not as pronounced a grow-over, because it's a revenue number versus a new business bookings number, but it does have the same impact. But we feel where we're right now, employer services, feels like a pretty good place in terms of trend and, in terms of trajectory as well. Jan Siegmund : And we don't provide, really, the precise revenue numbers, but it's kind of a little bit above, in the $100 million plus range of ACA impact to ADP. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Ashish Sabadra : This is Ashish Sabadra calling on behalf of Bryan Keane. Just a follow up question on retention. So last quarter, you had mentioned you had taken steps around improving the service capability which gave you some more confidence around retention, but we still saw the retention grow -- or decline. Now my question was when you think about the mid-market customer base you still have 25,000 customers remaining which are going to be migrated over the next four quarters and normally you don't do the migration in November, December which should imply around north of 6,000 customers being migrated every quarter, versus 4,000 that you saw in the last quarter. So with this elevated level of migration, how should we think about retention going forward? Could we see retention get worse before it starts to get better? Any clarity that you can provide on the retention front, that will be helpful. Thanks. Carlos Rodriguez : Sure, it's a good question, it's a fair question. I think your math is actually very close, the only thing I would add to that math is that, you know, you do have to apply a retention -- or a loss factor to that 25,000 itself over the course of 12 months. We naturally, even if we weren't migrating, would lose call it 10% of those clients. It might be a little bit higher than that, just because they're legacy type clients. The absolute number you're starting with that you have to divide over four quarters is a little bit smaller. But you're in the right ballpark. It's probably around 5000 or so clients that need to be migrated per quarter. We feel pretty comfortable with that pace, given the infrastructure that we've created and the new process we have for migrations. In terms of additional color, as you're pointing out, the results didn't cooperate with our desires and with our intentions and in part, that's because our retention is a reflection of the overall Company's results and there's variability across a lot of other businesses. I wouldn't read in to it, even though we still have a concentration of our retentions issues in the mid-market and they have been for this fiscal year. There is another $8 billion to $9 billion of revenue in ADP that also experiences variability in retention. But having said that to give you specifics around, you know, why our confidence level was high that things would get better and why it still remains high, we have a number of, in specifically the mid-market, issues that we were experiencing with rewards to retention. We have a lot of metrics, as you can imagine, that we look at that are leading indicators versus retention which is a lagging indicator. For example, the speed to answer phone calls, number of cases that are unresolved in a backlog, we have a number of escalations in terms of people escalating client service issues and the metrics are -- most of the metrics in the mid-market regarding service experience for our clients are either back to where they were prior to our retention issues or in some cases better. So we feel confident that even if there's some kind of lag in the sense that some clients may have already been in process due to a poor service experience of looking at alternatives and the fact that there are other parts of ADP that have variability and retention as well, I think not withstanding all those things, I think my confidence in the improvements in service, stability and service experience in the mid-market remain quite high actually. Jan Siegmund : And if I add a more technical comment, relative to our losses that we see over the fiscal year, we have cyclicality in our loss volumes and so year-end -- calendar year-end on the third quarter for us, fiscal year -- are traditionally higher loss months and the fourth quarter month is a lower loss months. So hence, there can be variability in the quarterly shifts of the retention numbers and this case it impacted a relatively low loss volume that we typically experience in the fourth quarter. So my general council would be to observe those retention changes that we report, but not to get overly analytical and mathematical quarter-by-quarter. It is a better indicator to think about basically our retention number of 100 basis points decline. So in the fiscal year, in closing, we're aiming to be better. We don't guide to retention, but as you might imagine as a Company, we clearly have aspirations to improve. Operator : Our next question from the line of David Grossman from Stifel Financial. Your line is open. David Grossman : I wonder if I could ask a question about the margin guidance. I think you gave us some good color on what the headwinds were going to be into FY '17, but if I understood you right, but if I understood you right there's about 20 basis points of incremental headwinds over and above what you're isolating as nonrecurring. Perhaps you could give us more insight in to, you know, what those incremental charges are and when you bundle everything together, you know, as you come out of FY '17, how should we look at how the model has changed and how the leverage in the model changes beyond FY '17? Jan Siegmund : So as we described, our initiative is really to create more concentrated centers of excellence and strategic locations and we indicate basically five big cities that we're doing. So as a consequence, approximately 5% of our employee population is going to be transferring or moving or the work will be moving and impacting about 5% of our associate population in this fiscal year. And there are costs that are related to this which are which we're non-GAAPing which are related in essence to employee costs to facilitate the transfer of the work that is basically included in the 20 basis points of our guidance. We clearly hope that the outcome of this service alignment initiative is multi-folded. I believe strongly it will enhance our service valuable proposition, because we're going to have larger centers with bigger capabilities, leveraging ADP's strength and compliance in service and offering a better value proposition to our clients which is the most exciting part for this service alignment initiative. Hopefully resulting in better competitiveness and higher retention rates and also as you can see, these centers are located in geographies of the U.S. that offer certain advantages, relative to the cost where they operate, so that we should be in the longer run also contribution to our margins. We're a little bit hesitant to specify this for 2018 because the initiative will actually bleed over in to FY '18, we mentioned in particular the center and investors West is going to come later in 2017 and will bleed over 2018. So 2018 will still have some impact, but we're clearly hoping that it will guarantee basically that we can fulfill our commitment to the 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion in the long run, so this is an important supporting initiative for that. Carlos Rodriguez : And David, I think you're right, the 20 basis points is above what we've put in quote, unquote the non-GAAP numbers. And I think, you know, that's just a frictional cost. They are identified. We know what those costs are and they are costed. It's not appropriate to bucket into the non-GAAP charges, I guess is the best way to put it. I'm not, obviously, the accountant, but I think your math is or your comment was spot on. So that's the, when we provided that color to give you more information to be able to come up with what you might think might be the longer term potential performance of the Company which as Jan said, we're optimistic about. And I think we're doing these things, you know, really there's two things that we're always focused on, service experience, the client experience from our service organization and implementation and just the operations of the organizational role and our competitiveness and our efficiency. I would call this a large initiative and a complex initiative that hopefully is coming across with the significance that it should and it's multi-year. David Grossman : And can I ask just one follow up on just the CapEx comment at well. So it sounds like CapEx is over $2 million related to this, so is there anything we should think differently about the year-over-year growth and pre-cash flow in FY '17? Carlos Rodriguez : I'll let, maybe Jan can comment a little more on the CapEx. We weren't implying that the entire CapEx was because of this initiative. We have normal ongoing normal CapEx. It's just trending higher than it has historically. So wanted to make sure that we put that out there. But I do want to comment, besides Jan giving you the specifics on the numbers, that we're investing in this Company. So this Company has an industry that has positive global dynamics in terms of growth. We just saw it with ACA in the U.S. We're going to see it with FLSA and the EEOC equity pay rules and we're seeing the same thing in other countries. And so this Company has opportunity. And we intend to invest in order to seize those opportunities. And so I think what you're seeing is our investment in CapEx and frankly also our investment in capitalized software which we disclosed but is not something that we necessarily always focus on, are all trending higher. And we take the deployment of capital very, very seriously as you know. But people should not mistake what our actions are for anything other than optimism about the future and the potential for these investments to have incremental returns for our shareholders over the long-term. Jan Siegmund : I have really only two comments to add is, so there's a temporarily higher capital expenditure rate and the increase is to the very largest amount driven by investments into our real estate project to get these facilities up and going. And related investments for this initiative. And secondly, I'd like also to remind you that ADP has pursued over the last couple of years a growth strategy that is more focused on our organic growth capabilities, focusing on investments into our own product set and focusing in this initiative on enhancing and developing additional market-leading service capabilities. So I think it's right in line with how the strategy has worked for ADP and it's really quite an exciting moment for ADP. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rick Eccleston from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Rick Eccleston : I wonder if we could go back on the new service initiative. Just kind of see if you could tie it in to the investments that you've made earlier in the delivery side, what informed this and how related or not was it to the service delivery issues and investments that you had earlier and just tie those two together. Thank you. Carlos Rodriguez : So I'll make a comment and then Jan I think can add. I really appreciate the question because they are, actually, quite separate topics. As though the service delivery issues that we experienced were concentrated in a particular part of our business in the mid-market and they were execution related. And I think what we're talking about in terms of our new service alignment initiative is a broad strategic objective across the entire Company. It's partly driven by the fact that the industry has evolved and I think the clients need to have evolved and the products have evolved. So as an example,10 years ago, having three or four different products that were serviced differently and different databases was not an issue. Our platforms now are single-database integrated solutions that provide an HCM solution if a client wants to buy it that way, in a comprehensive and seamless way. The service model had not moved in the same direction. And I think that this initiative is really intended to have our service and implementation really align with the way the market is going, the way buyers are buying and the way clients want to be serviced. So we've done similar things in our sales organization where that also requires that our sales force be trained and equipped to be able to sell in the new environment. So our belief is that now we will have our products, our service and our distribution all aligned. Jan Siegmund : And I think it is probably the best way to connect our focus on creating competitive technology platforms that are cloud-based and integrated as a prerequisite to create the integrated service model, so we have made really A, great progress with these strategic platforms, but B, also migrated now large numbers of clients on to these platforms. So it really does make good sense at this point in time to launch the service alignment initiative. And as you might imagine, we did have, we have tested these service models and components of our organization at smaller scale. And we have seen great results out of those pilots. Rick Eccleston : And then if I could just quickly follow up, Jan, on the comment you made earlier about how you've been making more organic investments. Has anything changed just in general in terms of your portfolio shaping, any sort of divestitures, small ones to come and how are you approaching M&A currently? Thank you. Jan Siegmund : The, no I think our principal stand on M&A has not changed. We have a very solid balanced sheet, we have the capital to investment in the industry and we continue to evaluate opportunities, but we evaluate M&A opportunities in light of our strategic priorities which is -- which are focused at this point in time on reduction of complexity and aligning and focus on our client needs. So any acquisitions that support that drive, what we will actively and aggressively pursue. But it has played out over the last three years to a more organic growth pattern that has seen great results. And so I think that stand stays the same. I would not expect any dramatic shift in our attitude towards M&A, from what you have seen in the last three years. And relative to divestitures and adjusting the portfolio, I think the large portfolio alignment initiatives have happened, with the spinoff of CDK and I think our larger, last larger divestiture was advanced. There will be here and there smaller type of things as we continually to evaluate the performance of our product portfolio and if we see opportunities to enhance shareholder value, we will pursue it as we have done so in the past. But it's really, in essence, I would anticipate FY '17 to run under the same guide polls as in the last three years. Carlos Rodriguez : I think Jan's absolutely right on all those points. I would just add that back to the discussion about capital and the seriousness with which we take capital deployment, we do have a strong balance sheet so we have capital we can deploy. But as Jan said, you know, consumptionally if something really fit into our technology roadmap and accelerated our progress, we'd use our capital. But we're not going to use our capital to have something that, for lack of a better term, sits next to everything else that we have. So it has to be able to be integrated rapidly and seamlessly into what we already are pursuing in terms of our product strategy. That's a little bit of a departure from, call it six, seven years ago when it was really more about leveraging our distribution and adding capabilities and products without as much, necessarily, regard to how they fit tightly into the technology road map. And that's really not so much a change in strategy. It's a change in the market and the way people want to buy and the way products behave which makes it very, very important to have tight alignment and seamlessness in your products. And then the last just factual comment I'll make to Jan's point, is we -- because we have capital, if something accelerated our progress, we would do it no different than we're doing some of these internal organic things that we're investing in to accelerate our progress. So if there's an external opportunity to use our capital, we would. But the fact is that over the last couple years, when you look at the balance of capital deployment, Jan and I have this discussion all the time, we haven't consciously avoided doing acquisitions. It's just been harder to find ones that make sense and fit in what we're doing in terms of our strategy. But net-net when you get down to it, we're spending, call it $300 million to $400 million less on acquisitions and we're spending more on things like internally developed products, capital expenditures and the investments that we 're talking about for FY '17. So it wasn't necessarily planned that way, but it just so happens that, you know, we 're not necessarily deploying any more capital, but we 're just deploying it in a slightly different way. But we do retain the right to deploy capital towards acquisitions as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon from Baird. Your line is open. Mark Marcon : Just wondering if you could just add a little more color in terms of the service realignment, in terms of, you know, how clients may end up being serviced? Is it -- you know, is there going to be a transition to like a dedicated service rap for the mid-market? What did you see out of the pilot studies and what's the -- what's the reaction internally, you know, with some of the service providers in terms of potentially geographically relocating? Carlos Rodriguez : It's a great question. We'll give you a little bit of color and then maybe Jan can add in terms of what he's hearing out in the field. It's interesting the term dedicated reps, because we do have parts of our business, obviously in the up-market and national accounts, we have very specific people that service specific clients. And then when you get in the small business market, we tend to have a model where, you know, the execution and the delivery is very important, but the person that you reach is not as important. We believe that's the right model. We believe our retention rates and our growth in the small business market prove that our model works as long as you execute well and we would also argue that in today's world, having a dedicated rep who works eight hours a day might not be the best service model for a small company or any other company. So we prefer to focus on how -- what's the best way to deliver the best service to the client in the way they want it delivered. And it varies from small business up to the up-market in terms of whether you need a dedicated person or not, but I would encourage you to kind of visualize this service realignment as being more around teams rather than dedicated people, so having alignment around teams. So as an example, given the attach rates that we've discussed over multiple quarters that we're experiencing now in the mid-market and in the up-market, around additional HCM modules -- in other words, clients are rarely buying just payroll by itself or just benefits administration by itself. So this service model really is intended to be able to provide a group of people or a team of people who work together, who are collocated and can deliver service across the entire HCM spectrum. That obviously requires some cross-training, but also some ability for people who have special skills to be available and close to people who need to support our clients on a multiple number of issues. So we have a reasonable amount of experience in experimenting with what we call intact teams or with collocated teams and we feel good about the results when it comes to retention, when to comes to client satisfaction and by the way in our business, when you have those two things, margin follows. So this is primarily led by quality and experience for the client and also by the way, opportunity for our associates. So what we have found also is in some of our subscale locations, there's very, very limited mobility and opportunity for associates to progress from a career standpoint. And we now have a number of opportunities across our business for people to learn new things and to move into different areas, whether it's time and attendance and pay roll, benefits administration, talent management, we really run the whole gamut on HCM and we needs across the entire business and when we have people scattered across the entire country in small subscale locations, it just doesn't I think make sense from a talent management standpoint for ourselves, internally either. And so on all those fronts, we think that this service alignment strategy makes sense. Jan Siegmund : Carlos mentioned most of the factors. I would add, too, we have seen a rise in our associate engagement scores as a consequence for those who work in those intact teams. And it reflects probably better of how in a modern team environment our associates want to work. So that's really exciting for our associates as well. And one additional component that a strategic move on locations allows you to plan for is also a coordinated effort between our market segments, small, medium and large. So I think we mentioned it in the call. So now we have collocation between those market segments and there can be natural growth and exchange of best practices between the different platforms. And for some of the platforms, the back end is fairly similar. If you think about sender-self excellence for our tax filing operation and so forth, so it allows us also to create buckets of scale that are very hard to create in smaller locations. So it really, I believe, will transform of how associates be perceiving A, the value of the job they're in and the job opportunities then that can reach in the future and allows us to deliver additional service capabilities to our clients which is the strategic benefit that we're reaping out of it. Mark Marcon : Certainly seems to make a lot of sense. I applaud you for taking this long-term step. Can you talk also with regards to the expectation for new bookings growth, where you would expect to see the strongest growth in terms of which areas? Jan Siegmund : Yes, I'll take this right on -- if you look at FY '16, we had actually fairly balanced growth across the business. We had great performance really along all segments and continued strength in multinational, great performance really across all segments. Maybe the only spot that has been a little bit harder was Europe as you might imagine and our best of breed solutions, but that was really more than balanced by good demand from multinational solutions. So when we look at the plan, other than specific grow-over challenges that we had because ACA cells were concentrated in the mid-market and in the up-market. If you take that out it's really each of the business units continues with very good performance and just as a reminder, it was $1.75 billion of recurring revenue that sales force generated for ADP and even if the growth is a few percentage points slower, this kind of still a very significant number. Operator : Our last question for today will be coming from the line of Gary Bisbee from RBC. Your line is open. Gary Bisbee : I wanted to go back to an earlier question, just around the concept of revenue acceleration. So you've had two years of above-trend bookings, you've got pace for control continuing to click along at a similar pace, you had a drag this year from selling a business that will no longer be a drag in 2017 and you know, retention was a drag, I guess you're not saying specifically, but maybe still a drag, but it sounds like a lesser one potentially in 2017. So why don't -- you've always said the current-year bookings don't do a lot to revenue. Why wouldn't we see some acceleration? Is it as simple as PEO? You're calling for that to be slower? It just feels like there should be a bit better revenue growth from, you know, thinking through all these moving parts. Thank you. Jan Siegmund : Yes, the math is how the math is going to work out between the starts that we have sold and the retention and there's really no change in how we have built our business models over time. We did have a little bit of unusual revenue skewing that created the more revenue acceleration, I guess, in this year than for next year which contributes a little bit to the thing. But if you -- if you take that into account, there's really nothing that unusual in next year's revenue growth. Carlos Rodriguez : Yes and I think that all the things you mentioned it's important to acknowledge what you said. We do, again even though we don't give specific guidance, we do expect less of a drag for example from retentions, because we expect things to get better. We have some metrics and some things underlying, I think, data that give us hope at least, right? Because we don't know for sure that will improve your math, the comments you made about new the business bookings, all those things are correct. I think I would just encourage you to maybe spend some time offline with us in terms of kind of the math and how the revenue works. One of the interesting things about this business, this is an incredibly stable and predictable business model. It's also very, very hard to move the numbers dramatically one way or the other over the course of one year. So over the course of four or five years, we've had double digit new business bookings and this year we had a blip with retention. But retention's also been fairly stable. That's allowed us to accelerate our revenue growth about 1/2 to 1 percentage point from, call it five years ago, in employer services. The PEO, as you said, also happens to be a factor because it's growing faster and it's becoming a larger portion of the overall results. So if it slows slightly that has an impact, too. So we'll spend the time to make sure we do the math, but what I can tell you is that you're right, that this year, if you exclude the impact of the divestiture or if you don't factor the divestiture in, we were close to 9% revenue growth. We're really proud of that. And next year we're slightly below that because there's one day less, because this year was a leap year or whatever the issues are and we have a drag still from, even though retention's getting better, it's still not as good as it used to be. We're still going to be pretty damn happy and pretty damn proud, because we're going to be in I think still, in the high end of our guidance from a revenue standpoint. And in this business, when you get into that range, given who we're, in terms of because we understand, we have very keen insight into who we're, like as a company in terms of where we want to be, in terms of our growth rates and our margin improvement and the balance of those things, I think we're, I think satisfied with that outcome. It obviously makes it easier as you pick up additional revenue growth because of the nice leverageability of our operating model. But, you know, that's part of why we're also doing some of the things we 're doing around service alignment, because we know that we're really not, I think satisfied with just the results that we have today. On the other hand, we're not going to sit here and tell you that we're trying to aim for 10%, 12%, 15% revenue growth because that's really not who we're. So 7% to 9% is our long-term guidance for revenue growth, with some margin improvement, with a healthy dividend, with share buybacks, that's our model, that's what we're executing against. And I'm proud of the Organization and the results they delivered this year. And I think if we deliver the results that we've put out there for next year, we're going to be just as proud of that as well. Gary Bisbee : Okay, great. And then if I could add just one quick follow up. On the ACA product, how much of the revenue would be charged for sending out like the 1095 forms and what not versus -- I assume there's some ongoing revenue related to the analytics and compliance tool-- Jan Siegmund : Yes, this allows me to make another pitch for our fantastic and very differentiated ACA product. It is actually far more than just sending out 1095 and 1094 forms. It is really a compliance service that we offer, that ongoing offers -- ongoing monitoring and assessment services for eligibility and affordability. And also which is really very differentiated in this market, offers what we call notice management services at the back-end to react to agency and exchange notices and keep the company in compliance with those, that's where a bulk of the fines can actually incur. So we build our clients on a per-employee per month basis. So the revenue stream is actually not concentrated on a specific form delivery, it's an annualized recurring revenue. And so you should think about the revenues exactly the same way you think about the rest of ADP. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question and answer session for today. I'm pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos Rodriguez : Thanks. This is our 67th year and where we've combined world class operations with innovative products and services that meet the dynamic needs of our clients. This was never more evident than in 2016 and I'm proud of the success of our business in getting the solutions to market to meet those needs of the clients and if I can get on my soap box for a second, I mentioned previously that ADP -- this is ADP's 41st consecutive year of paying and increasing our dividend. And as a dividend aristocrat, ADP is one of just over 50 companies in the S&P 500 who have paid an increase of dividend for more than 25 years. Now with some of the things we're talking about for FY '17, ADP leaders and associates are making the investments to lay the foundation for ADP to join the dividend royals in nine years. And that's a list of just 17 companies who have paid and increased their dividend for more than 50 years. Any student of business knows that only the most durable and enduring icons of business make either list. This success is entirely attributable to the hard work and dedication of our associates, who commit themselves every day to ensuring our clients' success. So to them and to all before them, I say thank you. And I thank you all for joining the call today and for your interest in ADP. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this now concludes today's conference. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect at this time. Everyone have a great day.",

Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker) Operator : Good morning. My name is Stephanie and I'll be your conference operator. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to ADP's First Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Christian Greyenbuhl, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Christian Greyenbuhl - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone. This is Christian Greyenbuhl, ADP's Vice President, Investor Relations. And I'm here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call and webcast. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures which we believe to be useful to investors. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. I also want to highlight for you that the quarterly history of revenue and pre-tax earnings for our reportable segment is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website. These schedules have been updated to include the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and have been adjusted to align with recent changes in our segment reporting to align our financial reporting with how management now views the business. Most notably, effective this quarter, we are now allocating stock-based compensation to the segments and have made some changes to the allocation methodology for certain corporate level allocations. Accordingly, prior periods presented have been restated and our segment guidance reflects the impact of these changes. Before Carlos begins, I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, as such, involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current excitations. Now, let me turn the call over to Carlos. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you, Christian, and thank you all for joining our call this morning. We appreciate your interest in ADP. This morning, we reported our first quarter fiscal 2017 results, with revenue up 7% to $2.9 billion, despite 1 percentage point of combined pressure from foreign currency translation and the impact of the sale of the AdvancedMD business at the end of our fiscal 2016 first quarter. We are pleased with this revenue growth, which was in line with our expectations. And we continue to see the benefits from our recent new business bookings helping to drive growth in the quarter. In addition to this solid revenue growth, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 26% to $0.86 per share. Overall, our earnings growth exceeded our expectations this quarter and we are very pleased with our results. There were a number of contributing factors to our strong earnings performance. Jan will walk through these shortly. On the new business bookings front, during the quarter, we were flat compared to the first quarter of 2016, which was in line with our expectations. We continue to forecast 4% to 6% bookings growth for the year. I want to remind you of the tailwinds we experienced in fiscal 2016 from the sale of additional modules related to the Affordable Care Act. Our anticipated fiscal 2017 performance, if achieved, would lead to a three-year compounded annual growth rate of 9%, which remains in line with our long-term new business bookings guidance of 8% to 10%. Overall, our revenue growth was solid this quarter. And while we do not expect all of the margin expansion we saw this quarter to continue through the remainder of the year, we are pleased with our overall results. Before I continue, I wanted to share a little more insight regarding retention. During the quarter, we experienced a decline in retention of 100 basis points, which was due to the loss of a contract pertaining to our CHSA business, which we announced today has been sold to WageWorks. Excluding the impact of this single client loss, retention would have been flat in the quarter. We continue to see the benefits of our efforts to upgrade clients to the most appropriate strategic cloud-based platforms. These upgrade efforts remain on track and progressed nicely during the quarter. As I just mentioned, today, we announced that WageWorks was acquiring two non-strategic ADP businesses; namely, our CHSA and COBRA businesses, for $235 million. In selling to a top-tier provider in these markets, we believe this agreement will truly unlock the potential of these businesses, while allowing us to sharpen our focus on ADP's core benefits administration offering. In conjunction with these dispositions, ADP entered into a partnership with WageWorks that will allow us to continue offering their COBRA and CHSA solutions to ADP clients in an integrated fashion. This is a great example of ADP continuing to build an ecosystem of complementary services that allow clients to extend the value of their core ADP Human Capital Management solutions. Last quarter, we shared details of our Service Alignment Initiative, which is part of our strategy to simplify the service organization by aligning ADP service operations to our strategic platforms. In addition to improving the client service experience, this initiative is expected to enhance ADP's service capabilities and contribute to operating efficiencies over the long-term. We are pleased with the progress we are making at our new strategic locations in Maitland, Florida, and Norfolk, Virginia. Efforts to staff and operate from these locations have commenced and are proceeding according to plan. We will soon announce the location of our third new site in the Western part of the U.S., which we anticipate being operational toward the latter part of this fiscal year. Our results this quarter reflect the strength of our business model and give us momentum as we stay focused on delivering an outstanding client experience through great service and innovative solutions, many of which are receiving a wealth of external recognition. Recently, we shared that ADP was named a Leader in Payroll Business Process Outsourcing by Gartner for the fifth consecutive year. Gartner's study analyzed vendors across all regions, employer sizes and service delivery models, evaluating both their ability to execute and completeness of vision. In naming ADP a Leader, Gartner recognized us for combining a clear view of the markets' direction and a deep understanding of client needs with the capabilities and expertise to deliver against them. Payroll outsourcing is core to who we are and is part of delivering outstanding HCM solutions. We are extremely proud of the sustained recognition for our leadership in this area. Today, ADP is delivering HCM solutions to more than 650,000 clients and 39 million employees worldwide. These data points are important for a number of reasons. They clearly demonstrate our unique reach and marketplace success over a sustained period of time. But they also represent a unique differentiator for ADP. The scale and the data that this client base represents allows us to deliver a suite of new capabilities that we believe hold the potential to transform the strategic value of the HR function. Because we pay one in six workers in the U.S., we are in the unique position to deliver advanced analytics capabilities that can help clients address workforce productivity, talent development, and retention. Leveraging this data, we introduced the ADP DataCloud to allow business leaders and HR professionals to generate actionable insights from the workforce data embedded in their ADP HCM solutions. And today, more than 3,200 clients are using our analytics platform. About a year ago, we introduced benchmarking to this platform. The benchmarking capability provides users with a unique competitive advantage by delivering insight from actual live data to help clients evaluate their workforce against other companies in their market space. Our benchmarking capability puts key industry workforce metrics at our clients' fingertips, avoiding the inherent time lag or inaccuracy associated with salary and other types of survey-based data. A few weeks ago, at the HR Technology Conference in Chicago, we received two distinctive recognitions for our DataCloud benchmarking capability. At the show, HR Executive Magazine named this one of its Top Products for 2016 and recognized it as one of the year's Awesome New Technologies for HR. I should note, this is the second year in a row that we've received these distinguished awards. We received them both last year for the ADP Marketplace, the first and largest HCM app ecosystem in the market. I've said before that innovation is a job that's never done, but we are proud of the progress to-date and the external recognition we are receiving. We believe that innovations like these and the investments we are making to simplify our portfolio are essential to our long-term success. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan for further review of our first quarter results. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you very much, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, we recorded a restructuring charge of about $40 million related to our Service Alignment Initiative. Certain non-GAAP measures in my commentary to follow exclude the impact of this charge as well as certain other one-time items recognized in the prior fiscal year. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found in this morning's press release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. Before I begin reviewing this quarter's results, I wanted to highlight some additional detail regarding the disposition of our COBRA and CHSA businesses. We currently expect the sale to be completed during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 for a pre-tax gain of approximately $200 million, subject to normal and customary closing conditions. The results of operations of these two businesses are currently included in the Employer Services segment and will not be reflected as a discontinued operation. Accordingly, we have factored the operational impacts from these dispositions into our updated fiscal year 2017 outlook. As Carlos mentioned, ADP revenues grew 7% in the quarter to $2.9 billion, or 8% on a constant dollar basis. On a reported basis, net earnings grew 10% or 9% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or adjusted EBIT, grew 21% or 20% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted EBIT margin increased about 230 basis points compared to the 17.6% in the last year's first quarter. This increase was driven by operational efficiencies and a slower growth in our selling expenses. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 26% to $0.86 and 26% on a constant dollar basis, and benefited from a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. Our adjusted effective tax rate was positively impacted following the adoption of a new stock compensation related accounting pronouncement in our first quarter, which helped drive a decrease of our adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 290 basis points to 30.8% or $0.03 on an EPS basis for the quarter. As you read this morning's press release, new business bookings growth was flat for the quarter, but in line with our own expectations following two years of successive double-digit growth with meaningful contributions from Human Capital Management modules that assist clients in complying with the Affordable Care Act. Overall, our results in the quarter were very good, yielding solid revenue growth with a better-than-expected margin growth. Although we still have a lot of work ahead of us, I'm also pleased with the progress to-date on our Service Alignment Initiative. In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 6% for the quarter and 6% on a constant dollar basis. Our same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.7% in the first quarter. Average client fund balances grew 4% compared to a year ago and 4% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was driven by additions of net new business and increased wage levels compared to the prior year's first quarter. Outside the U.S., we continue to see solid revenue growth and margin growth, driven largely by the success of our multi-national solutions, which continue to perform well. Employer Services margin increased about 230 basis points in the quarter. This increase was driven by operational efficiencies and a slower growth in our selling expenses following on from the difficult selling compare in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. The PEO continues to perform well, growing revenues by 13% in the quarter with average worksite employees growing 13% to 439,000 employees. A portion of the 13% revenue growth was impacted by slower growth in our benefit pass-through costs resulting from lower healthcare renewal premiums, which outweighed growth from higher benefit plan participation from our worksite employees during the quarter. Along with this revenue growth, the PEO delivered approximately 90 basis points of margin expansion this quarter through increased operating efficiencies. Both of our segments performed well in the quarter and, as Carlos mentioned, we are off to a good start, but we also see a mix of factors that impact our fiscal year 2017 outlook. And I will now take a moment to walk you through our revised outlook with you. First, as I mentioned, our new business bookings growth in the quarter was in line with our plans coming off a difficult compare in the prior-year first quarter. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of 4% to 6% growth on the $1.75 billion sold in fiscal year 2016. We are reaffirming our ES revenue guidance of 4% to 5% and maintaining our PEO revenue guidance at 14% to 16%. With the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses, which were included for the full fiscal year 2016 but expected to be only in our results for about the first half of fiscal year 2017, we have reduced our revenue expectations for the year by almost 1 percentage point. As a result, we are now forecasting revenue growth of 7% to 8% compared with our prior forecast of 7% to 9%, which is not expected to be significantly impacted by foreign currency translation based on our current rates. As a reminder, during the first half of fiscal 2016, we made certain investments to support our business through the ACA onboarding process, while also continuing to invest in our sales force to leverage the strong tailwinds from the sales of Human Capital Management modules that assist clients in complying with the ACA. And we are seeing the benefits of these investments help drive our margin expansion this quarter. I want to caution you, though, against assuming that this momentum will carry through the remainder of our fiscal year, as we begin to lap these easier compares while continuing to execute on various strategic initiatives, including our client upgrade efforts, investing in innovation and making selected additional service investments. On a segment level, we, therefore, continue to anticipate margin expansion in ES of about 50 basis points. And we are now forecasting about 75 basis points of margin expansion in the PEO. On a consolidated basis, we have revised our adjusted EBIT margin expansion to about 50 basis points from our previous guidance of 25 to 50 basis points. Please also note that this margin expansion continues to include about 20 basis points of pressure from a dual operation pertaining to our Service Alignment Initiative. We are also now expecting growth in our client fund interest revenue to increase $5 million to $10 million compared with our prior forecasted increase of up to $5 million. The total impact from the client fund extended investment strategy is now expected to be up $5 million compared to the prior forecast of flat growth. The details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. With the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses, we now expect growth in our adjusted diluted earnings per share of 11% to 13% compared with the $3.26 in fiscal year 2016, aided by about 1% from the first quarter tax benefit related to the stock-based compensation accounting change, which is offset by about 1 percentage points of earnings impact from the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses. On a constant dollar basis, our adjusted diluted earnings per share growth is expected to be 11% to 13%. Our forecast continues to contemplate the return of excess cash to shareholders, with share repurchases of $1 billion to $1.4 billion during fiscal year 2017. And this includes any repurchases required to offset any dilution related to employee benefit plans. We believe the adjustments we have made to our fiscal year 2017 forecast reflect the impact of our planned investment, particular through the year-end process as we work to grow our strong fiscal year 2016 sales performance and execute against our strategic initiatives. So with that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions. Operator : We will take our first question from the line of Rick Eskelsen with Wells Fargo. You line is open. Richard M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Just the first one just to confirm the guidance impact on the top-line, confirming that the divestitures of the CHSA and the COBRA businesses is responsible for the change in the revenue outlook, and then also confirming that I heard it was a 1% or so earnings impact from that divestiture as well. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: You're correct. That is the case. If you take it digitally, there's actually a good uptake (19:58) on both ends, the full percentage off (20:01) our guidance clearly just on the top end. So we clearly had a good revenue performance in the first quarter already. Richard M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And that's the only change to the revenue outlook is from that divestiture correct? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yes, that is true. Richard M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then, just following up on the service delivery changes, I'm just wondering, maybe philosophically or as you guys have evolved your business and added a lot more of your technology in the strategic platforms, how has the value of service changed to you or to your clients? And sort of philosophically, how do you approach service now? Thank you. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think as you heard in my comments about the investments we've made in DataCloud and benchmarking, I think there is an evolution of the definition of service to really providing more expertise and more help in terms of analytics and how to run their businesses better. So some of the things that we traditionally have been strong on in service, I think still are a key part of our value proposition. So as an example, we have a very effective, very value-added tax business that helps clients with compliance, should they get notices from either Federal, state or local agencies regarding tax payments. And so those are the types of services I think we remain committed to continuing to provide, but also to make better and enhance, but, obviously, with the evolution of technology and the evolution of the markets, I think there are opportunities for us to redefine service. And I think some of the Service Alignment Initiative, I think is intended to go exactly in that direction. So another example I would give is, given the increased penetration of multiple HCM modules when clients purchase our products particularly in the mid-market or in the up-market, I think the integration of not only our products but of our service experience becomes very important then. So you're heard us talk about creating intact teams in some of these new strategic locations that I think is intended to support this evolution of this new service approach and new service model. Richard M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Sure. Within the 20 basis points, the full-year margin headwind related to the dual running cost, as you move to your new integrated service delivery centers, how much was in the first quarter and when do you expect the crossover between increased productivity from the new centers to overcome those frictional costs? Is that a second half event or more likely in fiscal year 2018? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah, I would say that, given that we're in the process of ramping up, it's safe to say that there was some dual operations cost in the first quarter, but it's likely to be more concentrated later in the year in the second half. So I think you have that right. Probably 40%, I would allocate it just for sake of modeling, to 40%-60%, so 40% maybe first half, 60% second half, but overall, 20 basis points for the year. And again, as Jan pointed out, just because of the way the accounting rules work, that is built into our operating expense versus the restructuring costs that were really more intended for things like severance and facilities closure that were directly related to the restructuring and that are non-GAAP. David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. And then, are you seeing any additional interest in time and attendance offerings, given the Department of Labor's changes to the overtime regulations, which go into place this December? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: We are. As we were going through the materials for the earnings call, we get a lot of detail by market segment and also by product. And we have seen better sales and more interest in our Time and Attendance products. I think that the challenge for us is scale. Given the size of our sales number, we sold $1.75 billion last year. We're expecting to grow 4% to 6% this year. It just doesn't have the same scale and magnitude of, as an example, ACA. So for us to really to achieve our sales results, we have to have across-the-board strength in our sales excluding ACA and excluding our Time and Attendance products. So I guess the long and short of it is yes, it helped, but it wasn't material in the grand scheme of things. And the deadline is approaching so it's likely that we will continue. Like a lot of these changes in regulations and complexity, no different than ACA, we expect it to continue to help with sales and help drive demand for our products, even after the deadline, which I believe is in December of this year. But it just doesn't feel like it's having the same magnitude and same kind of scale impact that we had with ACA. And part that might be that the ACA rules were really deadline-driven, and there was a form that needed to be filled out and filed. In this case, these are just changes in rules. And so, it's a slightly different decision for clients and prospects around \u2013 in some cases, if they go six months without the right tools to be able to manage the new environment, there's really no consequences other than the risk of a potential investigation or fine or whatnot, which is obviously a real risk, but it's just different from a deadline-driven event like ACA. David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel Financial. Please go ahead. David Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp.: Thank you. Carlos, can ask you just a quick question on mechanics? The bookings comparisons last year are pretty difficult until the fourth quarter. So given that, how should we think of that 4% to 6% bookings target building as this year progresses, given those comparison? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I appreciate that question. And I think you may have answered the question yourself. So we expect the comparisons to get easier in the second half and hence, mathematically, the growth rates should be easier to achieve in getting to our overall 4% to 6% for the year. And I think just by way of comparison, we went back and looked historically, outside, of course, times where we had recessions and other economic challenges, but in Q1 of 2014, we had 1% sales growth, and that was following on Q1 of 2013 15% growth. And so the scenario this quarter was we had flat growth over last year's first quarter of around 14% sales growth. And so I think that when you look at kind of just the size and the scale of these numbers and you look at the way we laid out our forecast for the year, then I think that you can probably deduce that the second half, we expect, mathematically, to be stronger from a growth rate standpoint than the first half. I also just want to hasten to add that we have the same kind of issue in the second quarter, where we had sequential increase last year's second quarter, the 15%. So we had, I think it was 13% to 14% growth in the first quarter, and then we had 15% in the second quarter. So we will have another difficult compare, and I think it would be in line with our expectations to have similar sales results from a growth standpoint for the second quarter. David Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp.: Okay. And it looks like you were at 13% in the third quarter. So it sounds like it's pretty back-end loaded to the fourth quarter then? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: That would be right, but, again, we have more information internally around what portion of each of those three quarters was ACA-related versus other. And I would say that you're generally correct, but that we would expect the third quarter to have slightly better. Again, we try to stay away from \u2013 I don't want to fall into the trap of giving quarterly guidance. You're generally right. David Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp.: Right. And then, maybe I could just ask you a little bit more about you made some brief comments about the migrations in the mid-markets and how that's going in retentions. So given that retention was declining all of last year and you said it was flat when you back out the CVB (28:42) loss of the customer in the quarter, so does that really imply, given that you were losing throughout the year last year that, in fact, that business started stabilizing even before this quarter? And how, just in general, are you thinking about retention in the kind of residual base who still has not converted thus far? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Sure. I appreciate the question. So the businesses that we've had some challenges with last year, which I think we were clear that was concentrated in the mid-market, have shown, I think, improvement for several quarters, including this quarter. But, as you know, like, we have a number of different businesses. We're a global company. We have down-market, mid-market, up-market, multi-nationals. Some of our businesses are also lumpy, particularly our up-market businesses and our BPO businesses. And so we feel good about the progress we've made where we made the investments to stabilize and the investments we made in service. As you know, we're making some longer-term investments in terms of some of these new locations, but that's a longer term. We did a lot of short-term things to stabilize and improve and we've seen results from that. But, again, sometimes, retention can be uneven, just because of the lumpiness and just the way the math works, but we feel pretty good about where we are. We believe that we are on a good trajectory here in terms of continuing to do migrations and upgrades, which allows us to stay on track for what our objectives are without putting additional incremental pressure on retention. This is now probably the second quarter where we've gone back and started our upgrades at a, I would call, normal reasonable pace, and we've been able to continue to make improvements in our mid-market retention rate. So that tells me that part of the issue was related to the upgrades themselves, but it was also related to just service challenges, pressure from ACA just because of volumes of work and a couple of other factors. So we believe we've done the right things. And we feel like we're on the right track and we're also sticking to our plans around our migrations and our upgrades of our clients. So I think it just strengthens us competitively over the long-term. David Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp.: Great. Thanks very much for that color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Following up on the comments on margins you made earlier, I noted the discussion about lower benefit pass-through costs in the current quarter, but the PEO margins were, I think, a record at 13.5%. Could you maybe talk about whether margins in that segment specifically are sustainable and how much that one-time benefit from the lower pass-through cost had a benefit to optical margin improvement in the quarter? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Jim, thank you for your question, and I will answer it directly to your PEO question, but also put the margin question in a little bit bigger picture because there's a lot going on on margin and really we had great margin expansion this first quarter, but we are trying to send a signal that that might not be continuing throughout the year. And the pass-through, actually, played a big role in it. So to answer your first question directly, the operational scale that we saw in the PEO was solid. And with 90 basis points, clearly, that's ahead of our long-term kind of expectation, so we do see and want to make progress in the efficiencies, but it was probably a very good quarter for them and I would caution you to anticipate that type of level of productivity improvements in the long run. But clearly, all our businesses need to deliver scale when we're sticking with our own long-term expectations of driving the margin in the company of 50 basis points to 75 basis points. Now, relative to the performance in this quarter, and you will be able to dissect this once you go through the Q a little bit more detail, but the pass-through pressure that we had this year because the PEO was growing actually faster than the overall company, was actually depressing ADP's margin by about 85 basis points. Now, the pass-through pressure is typically actually higher. And if you calculate it, it's between 150 basis points and 200 basis points of pressure, we call this a portfolio effect, a lower margin business of PEO is growing faster than ES. And this quarter, we were helped because that typical, that higher-margin pressure that the pass-throughs give us, abated due to that good renewal. That renewal, we're expecting to grow out of it by the second half of the year. So that is going to be a big contributor to slower margin expansion for the second half of the year. You will also see that, and we mentioned it on our call, that we had a flat sales growth and it's longstanding tradition that if sales are growing slower, our marketing and sales expense is growing slower, so that contributed a chunk of scale that we anticipate clearly, per Carlos' discussion, just the prior question, to abate as we accelerate our sales in the second half of the year. And then, the scaling of our ACA business plays an important role. Clearly, you are all aware that the revenue stream started really in the second half of the ACA business, while in the first half of last fiscal year 2016, we made implementation and operational investments to build the business. So we started to see the revenue contribution kick in and the pressure that the building of the ACA business exuded on the business in the first half of last fiscal year has abated. We are reaping the revenue and the business is profitable. And so, the scaling of the ACA business also had a meaningful impact on the margin expansion this quarter. And clearly, we expect that actually to abate also in the second half of the year because the business started to generate revenue in the second half of last fiscal year. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: And I think just one other comment on the PEO, I don't remember the last time that our PEO worksite employee growth was the same as our revenue growth. And so that obviously, the very first point that Jan made, I think that helps. Obviously, mathematically, it makes it easier for the PEO to achieve greater margin improvement when they have slower pass-through cost growth. Having been in that business for many years, that slower pass-through growth is related to lower healthcare benefit renewals, which should be a very big positive from a competitive standpoint. So as you're hearing, seeing a lot of headlines about increasing health inflation and the discipline that our business has around selling and renewing clients, I think has, as of this last open enrollment for the PEO, led to very, very competitive renewal rates that are having this impact on the revenue growth, but it's a very, very big positive for that business. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs : That's helpful color. Thank you. And then, maybe just a quick clarification, the client loss in the CHSA business that drove the 100 basis point decline in retention was fairly substantial in terms of overall scale. Can you maybe just give us a little bit of color of whether that's a competitive takeaway and then specifically is that client a customer of ADP in terms of other service offerings? And what's the disposition on those other offerings, if any? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: So fortunately, it's easy to talk about it because WageWorks, I think, is the company who won that account. And they won it \u2013 it was one of the factors in our decision to sell the business to them because we got to know each other as a result of them winning that contract, which was a government contract from the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, which is a government entity. As you know, we don't have a lot of public-sector government business. We have some. And we like that business, but we just don't have a lot of it. And we certainly don't have a lot of contracts of that size and that scale, with or without the government. And so the original genesis of that account was, it came through an acquisition of a company called SHPS that we acquired several years back, where we acquired other benefits administration assets that we were interested in. And this account came with it. And with it, came the risk of, when these contracts get put out to bid, you don't always win. And so, we took a calculated risk when we made that acquisition, not just with this account, but like with all acquisitions, and that was one of the items that came along with that acquisition. I can't remember how many months ago it was, but I believe there was a public release by WageWorks regarding the winning of that account. And I think some people speculated that it had come from us. And we can now confirm that it did come from us. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi, guys. Good morning. Carlos, you've been talking about the data analytics opportunity and the value in that data you have, I guess really since the Investor Day at the beginning of last year. Can you give us a sense how you've, since then, progressed in terms of figuring out exactly how you will monetize the asset? Are you charging for this separately at the moment? Are you actively trying to sell that as a standalone offering? Or is it really more focused on an add into existing customers to help them see more value in ADP and hopefully improve retention? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: For now, we are selling it as an add-in. I think as I mentioned in my comments, we have 3,200 clients right now. That's obviously a very small number in comparison to the total client base that we have. So we think there's still a lot of opportunity. But we do like to leave our options open in terms of the \"monetization\", because the one thing it clearly does is it's a big differentiator for us. It's a huge way of creating thought leadership for ADP and, most importantly, it's an incredibly important way of driving value for our clients by helping them run their businesses better. So we think there's a number of ways that we could benefit from this in terms of stronger sales, additional revenues as an add-on module, halo effect in terms of marketing and thought leadership. So I think it's a big winner on a number of fronts, as other analytics and data businesses are for other companies. We're not the only company taking advantage of when you have the scale and you have the data, being able to marshal that to create differentiation and value for clients, I think is a pretty common theme out in the marketplace right now. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, and is there sort of a product roadmap as to other analytics and ways to expand the usefulness of this? And I guess one things that jumps to mind as a potential risk, are there regulatory issues or concerns or hurdles you have to get over in terms of using data about consumers, as either part of the benchmarking or however else it's used in this? Thank you. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: It's a very good question. The answer to the first part of the question is, yes, we do have a roadmap and we have lots of plans and things that we can do to create more benchmarking solutions and more analytics for our clients. And obviously, we're not going to talk about those right now. In terms of the second part, so we do have permission, if you will, to use the data from our clients. And, most importantly, the data is anonymized. And so this data, there is no personally identifiable information, and it's not necessary in order to create the benchmarkings and the analytics and the information that we deliver back to our clients. And so I think we're very sensitive, obviously. If there's any company in the world that understands the value of privacy and sensitivity to security, I think it's ADP. And we've been very careful over the last several years to make sure that we have the right kinds of approvals and permissions from our clients, and also that we are anonymizing the information so that none of the information has things like Social Security Numbers or addresses or anything like that. And that's generally not necessary to perform some of the analytics that need to be performed. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. And then, just a quick follow-up on the accounting adoption of the new accounting for stock-comp taxes, did you expect in the guidance any impact on the rest of the year? And given the variability of that, do you have confidence in that outlook? Or is this something that could be a positive later in the year, but it's just hard for you to predict at this point? Thank you. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you for the question, because it is quite a big impact that we experienced as a tax benefit for this year. And we have taken the stand not to forecast the impact of the tax impact of our equity compensation cost for the future quarters, because it is dependent on our share price development, and it is also dependent on the employee behavior and executing mostly stock options. So our plan is every quarter, to let basically that tax benefit fall through to the bottom line, and we would update our guidance for the total EPS growth one-on-one as the tax benefit or the tax hurt is incurred. We have done a historic analysis of our performance under these, so to speak, a pro forma backwards. And historically, we have experienced benefit out of those accounting rules, but there's no guarantee that that would continue in the future. And we found it too difficult to forecast. So we take it as falling through and you would get benefit one-on-one in each quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. On the Service Alignment Initiative, can you guys just talk a little bit about how you see the impact of that, both on driving ancillary revenue streams as you I guess move to a teamed selling model, or a teamed service model, long-term margin improvement and then also any potential disruption in the client relationships as you consolidate people back? Just what are the kind of the puts and takes and how do you see those playing out as you implement the new service alignment model? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think you did a very good job of describing some of the puts and takes in terms of some of the potential upsides and some of the risks. As you heard from our comments, we did build in what we're calling dual operations costs to avoid the last part that you mentioned, which is transition challenges, if you will. So we want to make sure that we have people trained and ready before we move work. But there's obviously always, you have to manage through that kind of transition risk as well. To be clear, we're not moving 90% of our associates. We're moving anywhere between 5% and 10% of our associates. So over time, we expect that to have the kind of positive impacts we're talking about in terms of incremental revenue growth, improved service, et cetera, but this is not a one-time overnight, dramatic move that is intended to create an enormous amount of risk or, frankly, disruption for our associates, because we have a long history of treating our people right. We have highly tenured associates that have been very loyal to the company. And so we're being very, very careful and methodical on how we do this and how we communicate to our associates, so that we can move on with our business plans, but also treat people the right way. But having said all that, the idea, as we've said, I think, previously, is to, most importantly, deliver better integrated service through intact teams of multiple modules of HCM. And so the intention would be that there would be a benefit to retention. We don't have a scientific way of forecasting that or telling you when that will happen. And it certainly is not expected to happen this year, because we're just in the process of getting these places all ramped up and scaled. And obviously, the effect of having better service, a better reputation and being able to cross-sell more easily, should have some impact on our ability to sell and on our revenue growth as well. But, again, those are hypotheticals that are very hard to forecast and we're certainly not building anything into our forecast for this year. But we're not doing it just to take risk. We're doing it because we see benefits in terms of operational efficiencies, potential retention and potential growth down the line. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I might add for our associates, also it offers, of course, a better ability to work in centers that have defined career pathing. They are located in areas of the U.S. that we believe give us great access to all associates. And so, it will create really also for us as an employer of choice, a great opportunity to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah, as Jan was saying, associate engagement is an incredibly important part of our success and of any service business' success. And I think having large centers with anywhere between 2,000 and 3,000 associates that are able to progress in terms of their careers, move across business units, across different parts of HCM, I think should be a very big positive for us. But, again, that's a longer-term benefit for the company. Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. And then, just as a quick follow up, can you give us an idea of \u2013 one thing you don't comment on very frequently is what the retention dynamics are within the PEO. On one hand, I know that the average client size there is smaller, so you're more likely to lose, just from companies going out of business. But on the other hand, I don't know why, once you join the PEO, why you ever leave. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: The PEO average client size is now slightly below 50, actually, so around 40, I believe. I'm looking at Christian, so about 40 employees, so it has ticked up a little bit. And I think this has been partially driven, of course, by the dynamic of the last few years where we added slightly larger clients to the PEO because it offers a great answer on compliance and probably partially a little bit aided by the dynamics of the Affordable Care Act. And I'm happy to report that the PEO exhibits great retention rates. And they have been actually improving over time. I'm looking at Christian. If (48:42) I say they did have record retention this quarter, so they're doing well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, hi, guys. Just noticed, Carlos, in your comments, you were talking about the strategic cloud platforms having a positive impact on your business. So I guess I was just curious of what percent you are complete migrating clients to these cloud platforms now? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Again, we do look at it by segment because you do have to be careful about units versus revenue, right, and two things are important. So if you at it based on units, we're almost 90% migrated, but that's mainly because we've moved all of our clients onto our RUN platform in the down markets. So from a revenue standpoint, we're a little bit less than half, I think, of the revenues for the company. So if you look at it by segment, we're done in the down market. I think we should be done by the end of this fiscal year. I think that's consistent with what we said in the past, that we're on track. And we're saying it now, that we're on track to have our mid-market clients on our WFN current version platform by the end of this fiscal year or within a month or two after that. And then, when you move up into the up-market, we have migrated some clients over to Vantage. And we have plans underway to continue those migrations, but those are literally one at a time. Whereas, in the down-market and in RUN, there were just large groups of clients that we would migrate every week. In the up-market it's one at a time, talking to each client individually, creating a schedule and creating a path, but we have done migrations. And we will continue to do migrations in the up-market, but that will take considerably longer than what we did in our down-market business, which took us probably over the course of two years to three years to migrate all of those clients. So we're very happy with the progress. We believe that when we migrate our clients, we create a more defensible, bigger moat against competition. We believe that it creates an opportunity for us to sell additional products and services. And we believe it strengthens our relationships with our clients. And most importantly, we think it's the right thing for our clients. So we're still on track and we're continuing to move ahead. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. No, I appreciate the update. And then, just as a follow-up, retention was down, I think, 1 point last year, in fiscal year 2016. If you ex out the divested acquisitions, does it make any difference to that retention number? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Too small to have an impact. The divestiture really has no impact one way or the other. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So it was kind of an unusual one-time client loss that caused this? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: This is a one large client loss. We typically don't have clients of this size. And we point it out because it is a non-strategic asset in the public space, so this is a very unique situation for us. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Again, this is disclosed in our 10-K and in our once-a-year. I don't believe we have another client that represents that size revenue for us. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks so much. Just a couple of quick questions, I noticed your cash flow from operations was fairly sizable, a nice increase on a year-over-year basis. Were there some timing issues going on either this year or last year? And how should we expect the quarters to kind of play out for the rest of the year? Thanks. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I am excited that we get a cash flow question. We rarely do get one. So your hint, you're already also giving the right answer. If you dig a little deeper into our operational cash flows, you'll see a cautious (52:32) swing in our accounts receivables on our balance sheet. And this is driven mostly due to accounts receivable change in the PEO business and that has rectified itself already. If you adjust for a number of one-time items in this, cash flows are expected to really grow in line with our operating results, so it could be these timing issues on accounts receivable here and there, but, in the long run, cash flows develop really very nicely in line with our operating performance. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, great. That's helpful. And I know some of the other business services and staffing-related companies have been talking about some client uncertainty in terms of making decisions. And I'm just curious if you've been seeing any of that. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I'm not sure how you measure that, so I think we know that, for example, in fiscal year 2011, when we had government shutdowns and so forth, like because this is \u2013 we hesitate to answer the question because we don't have any way of really measuring that. But intuitively, we know that large events do sometimes impact, particularly up-market decision-making. And so, is the election having some kind of impact? You'll have to stay tuned for our next quarter call, that we will be able to tell you, with the benefit of hindsight, whether or not we experienced some of that. So very hard to measure, but we have to acknowledge that large events and large uncertainties do sometimes create uncertainties in the market. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah, I guess what they have been saying is that they've been seeing some delays in terms of new business sign-up and I thought maybe you'd seen some of that impact on your bookings, not necessarily just the tough comparisons versus last year. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Through the first quarter, the answer would be if you exclude \u2013 and again, this is also not scientifically easy to do, because we sold so much additional modules, not just ACA, but related to ACA, so Benefits Administration, et cetera. But if you look at our sales results and take a general swag, if you could somehow back out the ACA sales from last year, we had, I would say, good sales results for the quarter. So I would say that through the first quarter, the answer would be we didn't see a lot of that, but I think you should not under-hear in my comments any level of confidence that there isn't that happening because large events like we saw with the 2011 and 2013, (55:10) there were couple of budget battles and a couple of issues around government shutdown and so forth, that it did seem that there were some kind of delays in terms of decision-making in the marketplace. But back then and today, we have no way of measuring that, other than anecdotal stories. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. I know it's a tough question to ask. So I appreciate you taking a stab at it. Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And we have time for one more question. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. Please go ahead. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just with regards to majors, how many more clients do you still have to transition and how would you characterize those clients as they're coming up along the tail-end? Are they more likely to go through a smooth transition or are they more inclined to be kind of the types that would take a look at other alternatives? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: It's a great question. And I think, as usual, the answer is I think it's mixed, in terms of we have a lot more experience, obviously, now in migrating clients and, particularly, the experience we developed last year when our volumes of upgrades almost doubled as we were trying to move clients over to the new platform in order to be able to give them the ACA product. That really created an enormous amount of learning opportunity for us in terms of how to do it better and how to do it at scale and what not to do around these upgrades, because they're intended to be a positive and to create a better experience and deliver a better product to the client. And so, I think on one side of the scale, you would say we have an enormous amount of body of knowledge now on how to do this better. On the other side of the scale, human nature is such that \u2013 and no one consciously does this but \u2013 then when you go through these types of events, you realize, oh, it looks like we have some of the toughest ones waiting towards the end, because there may be clients, for example, that we approach and ask them to upgrade and they say, well, I don't want to do it now, call me in a quarter. And then, we are getting to the point now where we're going to have to migrate them or upgrade them. And so we probably have some of that as well. So I don't think there's an enormous amount of that. It's not like we only have the hard ones left and the ones who didn't want to go, but just being realistic in the sense that \u2013 and also deferent to our associates who have still a lot of hard work ahead of them over the next three quarters or so, because it's not going to be easy getting across the finish line. But our volumes now are at a more manageable level, where I think we're doing a much higher quality job. So we feel good about our ability to do it, but your questions are, I think, fair. And I think the answer is the scales are balanced. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. I appreciate the answer. And then, with regards to Vantage, how well positioned is that now for like once you get through this and you're going through the next stage of transitions, do you feel good about that solution as it currently stands? I know you're always innovating, always optimizing. Is it matters of degree in terms of getting it to exactly where you want? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I mean, to put it in perspective, we have about double the number of clients. I think it's up to 270 or 280, somewhere in the range, at the end of this quarter versus the same period last year. So I think that tells you something. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah, that's great. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: We would like it to be higher. And we would have liked it to have been higher by now, but I think we're still growing well. We had good growth in the quarter in terms of Vantage. So I mean, I think that in terms of the product itself, we're pretty happy with the progress we've made, particularly over the last two or three releases. Again, we get a lot of metrics and a lot of data around stability and other factors, defects, et cetera, and we've made a lot of progress. So it feels like the trajectory is in a positive direction for Vantage, not just growth-wise, but I think in terms of the underlying metrics that we measure around quality and stability. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: We thank you all for joining our call today. As you can tell, we got off to a really good start, on top of the great results. We're incredibly happy about the positive recognition we're getting in the marketplace, as you heard from some of my comments. It really helps us in terms of our thought leadership in the market. I think the investments we're making in our innovation efforts and also our simplification of our portfolio and aligning them to our service model, I think are going to yield great results for us. And I think we have a lot of confidence in our ability to execute against those plans. The last thing I want to do is just acknowledge associates. We had a very tough year last year. I know I said it last quarter, but we had a challenging year. And we really appreciate all the efforts to continue to deliver great service to our clients. The commitment that our service associates have to our clients is unmatched, and it's one of the great strengths of ADP. So I just want to acknowledge them and give them my appreciation. And also, I want to thank all of you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in ADP. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect and, everyone, have a great day.",

Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Operator : Good morning. My name is Nicole, and I'll be your conference operator. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to ADP's second quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Christian Greyenbuhl, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Christian Greyenbuhl - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone. This is Christian Greyenbuhl, ADP's Vice President, Investor Relations. And I'm here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call and webcast. Before we begin, you have noticed in this morning's earnings release that we are now including a breakout of PEO segment net revenue and pass-through revenue to assist you in updating your models ahead of your quarterly 10-Q filing. Please refer to Footnote B on the income statement for further details. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures which we believe to be useful to investors. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, as such, involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current excitations. Now let me turn the call over to Carlos. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you, Christian, and thank you all for joining our call this morning. We appreciate your interest in ADP. This morning, we reported our second quarter fiscal 2017 results, with revenue up 6% to $3 billion or 7% on a constant dollar basis. This quarter, we saw the continued benefits of strong prior period new business bookings and a strengthening in our retention metric which helped to drive organic revenue growth across all market segments. Our earnings growth exceeded our expectations this quarter with adjusted diluted earnings per share growing 20% to $0.87 per share. Jan will take you through the key contributing factors to our strong earnings performance in more detail shortly. During the quarter we experienced a decline of 5% in new business bookings compared to a strong second quarter in fiscal 2016. These results reflect a continued difficult grow-over related to the tailwinds from our fiscal 2016 sales of additional modules related to the Affordable Care Act, which was expected. Additionally, within the midmarket and upmarkets in particular we also experienced the effects of political uncertainty leading up to and following on from the November U.S. elections which slowed decision making among some clients and prospects during the quarter. Our value proposition remained wrong and we have a successful track record of managing change for our clients. As you have seen with ADP many times in the past, change can provide us with significant opportunities to grow and expand our solutions to help deepen our client relationships. We expect that the environment in 2017 and beyond will be no exception and at this current uncertainty and related hesitancy, will be a short-term phenomenon. Accordingly, we continue to expect new business bookings growth in the second half of fiscal 2017, but in light of the second quarter decline, we have now revised our outlook and now expect to be about flat for fiscal 2017 as compared to the $1.75 billion sold in fiscal 2016. The client experience remains a priority for us whether it's through investments in our service model, in innovation and the user experience or in our efforts to upgrade clients with the most appropriate strategic based platforms, we believe that we have the right strategy to address these continuously evolving needs and opportunities and we remain pleased with the progress we are making. We continue to see the benefits of higher retention rates for clients on our strategic platforms and from our continued investments in service. Accordingly, this quarter retention increased in line with our expectations by about 10 basis points as we saw the benefits of these ongoing efforts help drive further improvements in client service metrics. But at the same time, we remain cautious as we enter the time of the year when clients in our industry are most likely to change providers. In January, we completed the acquisition of The Marcus Buckingham Company or TMBC, to expand our core talent portfolio. This relatively small, but strategic acquisition brings together ADP's robust dataset with TMBC's innovative talent solutions so as to help clients build a better and more engaged workforce. TMBC and its founder Marcus Buckingham are cutting-edge innovators in using data and research to drive talent management practices. Their cloud-based performance and talent management solution now known as ADP StandOut coupled applications with coaching and education to give leaders the tools, insights and data needed to improve employee and team performance. Feedback on this acquisition from many of our mutual Fortune 100 customers has been extremely positive. We look forward to delivering new data-driven solutions to the market that bring together the unique capabilities of ADP and TMBC. As we think about the future growth of ADP, we anticipate that investments such as these coupled with our ongoing organic investments in innovation, service and sales will enable us to continue to stay at the forefront of the HCM industry. Other examples of our innovative successes can be seen in the traction of our ADP DataCloud and ADP Mobile Solutions app. As you know, we introduced our ADP DataCloud to allow business leaders and HR professionals to generate actionable insights from the workforce data embedded in their ADP HCM solutions. Today, several thousand clients are using our DataCloud analytics platform and we continue to advance the solution with new capabilities. During the quarter, we added depth to the geographic benchmark data and added time and labor benchmarks such as market-based absence and overtime. These new benchmarks are unique within HCM and leverage our close to 30 million anatomized U.S. employee records to assist HR professionals in developing and fine-tuning their strategies. With respect to the ADP Mobile Solutions app, we recently announced the number of users has surpassed the 10 million mark. Our Mobile Solutions app is the most downloaded app in the HCM market with users spanning 200 countries. We've continued to add new features and functionality to embrace the modern users' needs from workers accessing stock profiles, editing team schedules or approving time-off requests to users changing their 401(k) contribution or viewing their account performance. Organizations know that employees expect technology to be easy to use and accessible from anywhere while simultaneously being powerful and secure. Our Mobile Solutions app is the first app of its kind and continues to be consistently among the top three business apps in Apple App Store. For the last couple of quarters, we've been sharing our plans regarding our Service Alignment Initiative and I'm excited to highlight for you that we've been making great progress. During the last quarter, I took part in the opening of our new service and implementation facility in Norfolk, Virginia. We welcomed more than 400 associates to a new signature building and anticipate our presence in Norfolk will ultimately reach 1,800 associates. We are similarly on track in hiring in Orlando where we expect to eventually have about 1,600 associates. Also during the quarter, we announced our third new strategic service center in Tempe, Arizona. We anticipate opening that facility in the spring of 2017 with a capacity of 1,500 associates in that location. These new centers are a critical component of our overall service strategy and will enable us to significantly enhance ADP's service capabilities across the HCM spectrum. Lastly, before I turn the call over to Jan, I would like to add how gratified we are for the recognition we continue to receive from the HCM industry and the customers we serve. During the quarter, ADP received the Everest Group's highest recognition for our GlobalView HCM solution. Their report recognized us for the scalability of our solution while noting ADP's reporting, analytics and mobile app are key differentiators for us. In addition, ADP DataCloud earned a Cloud Computing Innovation Award from Ventana Research, recognizing our ability to deliver positive business impact. In bestowing the award, Ventana noted ADP's ability to provide organizations with data that can reveal the workforce trends and provide the deep insights needed to make better business decisions. In closing, despite the recent uncertainty in the U.S. business environment, we continue to believe that change will be beneficial to us as we are well-positioned to help our clients navigate the complexities of HCM. I remain confident in ADP's future and in the success of our strategic initiatives. In fact, I believe that we're in a firm position for sustained growth and success as we continue to make the technology and service investments to further increase the strategic value of the HR function. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan for further review of our second quarter results and an update to our fiscal 2017 outlook. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you very much, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, during the quarter we completed the sale of our CHSA and COBRA businesses and realized a pre-tax gain of $205 million. The historical results of these businesses are reported in the Employer Services segment and are not reported as discontinued operations. Furthermore, we recorded a $1 million restructuring charge related to our Service Alignment Initiative. Certain non-GAAP measures in my commentary to follow exclude the impact of these two items as well as certain other one-time items recognized in the prior fiscal year. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found in this morning's press release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. As Carlos mentioned, ADP revenues grew 6% in the quarter to $3 billion or 7% on a constant dollar basis. Net earnings grew 50% to $511 million on a reported basis or 49% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT grew 17% or 16% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted EBIT margin increased about 180 basis points compared to the 18% in last year's second quarter. This increase was driven by operational efficiencies and slower growth in our selling expenses. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 20% to $0.87 or 19% on a constant dollar basis and benefited from fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. New business bookings this quarter were down 5% partially due to the difficult selling compare in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, but also from an elevated level of buyer uncertainty around the November U.S. elections leading to a slowing of buying decisions in our mid and up markets. As Carlos mentioned, our retention was up by 10 basis points in this quarter, and we are pleased with the progress that we have been making with our midmarket initiative and the continued strength of our retention on our strategic platforms. I would like to caution you that retention on a quarterly basis remains a volatile metric. Our full-year guidance takes into account known losses and anticipated losses. Overall, we are pleased with our results in this quarter stemming from solid underlying revenue growth with better than expected margin growth and an improvement in our client retention. Although we are disappointed with our overall new business bookings performance this quarter, we continue to believe in the underlying strength of our distribution model as well as our pipeline of market opportunities. In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 4% on a reported and constant dollar basis for the quarter. Our same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.3% in the second quarter. Average client funds balances grew 2% on a reported and constant dollar basis compared to a year ago. This growth was driven by net new business and increased wage levels compared to prior year's second quarter. Outside the U.S., we continue to see solid revenue growth and margin growth, largely driven by the success of our multinational solutions, which continue to perform well. Employer Services margin increased about 150 basis points in the quarter. This increase was driven by operational efficiencies and slower growth in our selling expenses following on from the difficult selling compare in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. PEO revenues grew by 12% in the quarter, with the average worksite employees growing 12% to 452,000. The PEO continued to experience slowing growth in benefit pass-through costs resulting from lower healthcare renewal premiums, which outweighed growth from higher benefit plan participation from our worksite employees during the quarter. PEO margins continued to expand through operational efficiencies and slower growth in selling expenses, both of which helped drive approximately 120 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. We anticipate we will return to a growth trajectory in new business bookings in the second half of fiscal year 2017. However, as a result of the second quarter decline, we are now forecasting fiscal year 2017 new business bookings to be about flat compared with our prior forecast of 4% to 6% growth. As a result of this change to our expectations, we have updated certain elements of our fiscal year 2017 forecast. As a result of our revised new business bookings guidance and slower growth in our PEO-related pass-through revenues, we now anticipate total revenue growth of about 6% compared with our prior forecast of 7% to 8%. This revised outlook includes almost one percentage point of expected combined pressure from the sale of our CHSA and COBRA businesses, which occurred towards the end of the second quarter, and the impacts from foreign currency due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We have adjusted our revenue forecast for the Employer Services revenue growth to 3% to 4% compared with our prior forecast of 4% to 5%, which included almost one percentage point of expected pressure from the sale of our CHSA and COBRA businesses. Separately, as a result of the slower growth in our PEO pass-through related revenue, we now anticipate PEO revenue growth of 13% compared with our prior forecast of 14% to 16%. We continue to expect our consolidated adjusted EBIT margin expansion to be about 50 basis points, which includes about 20 basis points of pressure from dual operations pertaining to our Service Alignment Initiative, which was not part of our non-GAAP charges. On a segment level, as a result of our lower revenue growth forecast, we now anticipate margin expansion in Employer Services of 25 to 50 basis points compared to our prior forecast of about 50 basis points. For the PEO, we expect continued operating efficiencies and slower growth in our pass-through revenues as compared to fiscal year 2016 to help drive margin expansion on a full-year basis. Accordingly, we now expect fiscal year 2017 PEO margin expansion to be at least 100 basis points compared to our previous forecast of about 75 basis points. We are also now expecting growth in client fund interest revenue to increase about $15 million compared to our prior forecasted increase of $5 million to $10 million. The total impact from the client funds Extended Investment Strategy is now expected to be up about $10 million compared to the prior forecast of $5 million. The details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. We continue to expect growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share of 11% to 13% compared with the $3.26 in fiscal year 2016, aided by about one percentage point from tax benefits related to the stock-based compensation accounting change, which is offset by about one percentage point of earnings impact from the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses. Our forecast now contemplates a return of excess cash to shareholders via share repurchases of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, subject to market conditions, during fiscal year 2017, compared to our prior forecast of $1 billion to $1.4 billion. This forecast includes any repurchases required to offset dilution related to employee benefit plans. We believe that the adjustments we have made to our fiscal year 2017 forecast reflect the impact of our planned investments, particularly through the year-end process, as we work to grow over our strong fiscal year 2016 new business bookings performance and execute against our strategic initiatives. So with that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our first question from the line of Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe to start with you, Carlos, in terms of the bookings pressure that you saw post-election, I think you highlighted that that pressure mainly came in the midmarket and upmarket segments. Can you maybe talk about your level of confidence that you're going to see a recovery, what you saw in January, and then also was that a departure from what you saw in the downmarket and small business? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: It's a great question. Obviously, there are two factors that are affecting the growth in our new business bookings. One was the known factor which is the difficult grow-over and obviously, we had some sense of that and factored it in in terms of our guidance for the year because we were obviously below our long-term 8% to 10% as a result of what we knew was going to be a more limited base to sell into since we had already sold half of our clients on ACA. So that was a known factor, but the reality is we didn't know exactly how much difficulty we would have in selling additional modules of ACA over what we sold last year. So that is a factor that obviously has become more difficult to measure given the talk of the administration of repeal and replace of ACA. So I guess, in a nutshell, whatever we assumed about the difficult grow-over, I think, it became a much more difficult grow-over as we think many companies in the midmarket and upmarket are probably \u2013 have a wait-and-see attitude in terms of what's going to happen around the Affordable Care Act. I think that there's also this kind of second factor which obviously we have no scientific way of measuring which feels like people are in general just delaying and waiting to see what happens not just with ACA, but with a variety of other things that the administration is talking about. Having said all that, there are also a lot of positive things and we see that reflected in some of the public markets or the equity markets in terms of anticipation of lower tax rates and fiscal stimulus and so forth. And in particular, one of the things that I noted, I've seen a chart that shows \u2013 I believe it's the NFIB confidence index, but small business confidence indexes are kind of off the charts positive and in a strange way, it's a little bit reflective of kind of what we're experiencing which is continued success which we don't give guidance by segment, but we have very good and strong new business bookings results in our down market and not so much in our mid and upmarket. And of course, the PEO, we generally consider to be a down market business but that business does have obviously a relationship to ACA and what's going on around regulation and the variety of regulations that had been talked about previously that now may be subject to change on a go-forward basis. So there's a lot of moving parts and hopefully that provides you a little bit of color, but we don't have really great precise scientific tool to be able to ascertain how much of the weakness is coming from each factor. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's helpful. And then maybe just on a kind of looking forward basis, you talked about some of the small business confidence indicators, NFIB, et cetera. Can you maybe talk about the broad effect of other potential administration policies or congressional action that might either be a tailwind or headwind over the next few quarters? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Sure. I mean, the most obvious one is this the discussion around the Affordable Care Act, so we \u2013 as I mentioned in my prepared comments, ADP generally does well when there's change, but not when there's uncertainty about change. And so I think a protracted debate about what replacement means or what will be happening is probably not helpful to us in terms of our new business bookings results. There are a number of other items out there around, for example, overtime rules, EEOC [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] reporting around pay equity and even DOL rules around the fiduciary responsibility that affects our retirement services business. So there's a number of things that are in play by the administration, generally speaking over 67 years we have benefited from whether it's one particular party or another particular party or one philosophy versus another philosophy because generally there's change, there's constant change and I think, employers use services like ours to help them manage through that change. So we, on a medium to long-term basis, are, I think, optimistic that whatever form comes of healthcare reform whether it's more state based or just a different way of providing because I think the administration appears to be committed to maintaining the number of people that have insurance so that will require some form of tracking and some form of enforcement or tax credits and it maybe more state based, but that's something that we hope to be able to help our clients navigate through when the administration and Congress, I think, get further along in terms of figuring out what exactly they want to do. And there's a number of other regulations that are probably less public and less significant on an individual new business bookings basis, but they all add up to quite a lot of bit of potential change which I think would be very good for ADP. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: And Jim, if I add on the revenue risk that we might have for this year, I would consider that as minimal so our clients that are subscribing to our ACA solutions obviously are preparing for their filings in this fiscal year and anecdotal evidence is that our clients really look forward to ADP to help them through that change. So the actual revenue risk for this fiscal year, I would describe, as minimal. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: As you can see from our retention notes, we haven't add \u2013 I think, Jan makes a great point which is what's fascinating is obviously the challenge for us right now is the new business bookings, but we haven't had cancellations or in fact we have clients that are still being implemented on ACA, but it's natural that once you've made a decision and you're committed and you're on the path and it is the law, by the way, it still is the law, it makes sense to go forward, but I can see how some people, if they're doing it in-house or doing it themselves might be hesitant to make a decision given the uncertainty around what's actually going to happen regarding the law. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh of William Blair. Your line is now open. Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. Thanks. Just following up on the comments about the PEO business. I wasn't clear because you said down market, you did well and I consider that down market, but it also seems like you're saying that was another area where bookings growth was a little slower. Could you clarify and, I guess, elaborate on that? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Well, I didn't say the new business bookings growth was weak in the PEO, we don't give segment reporting with details of our bookings. I was just trying to give you a general flavor because, as you saw, we also had some weakness on the revenue growth, but that wasn't necessarily related to ACA, but just in general, I was trying to convey that there is some logical, I guess, explanation to some of what's happening in the sense that there appears to be a lot of optimism on the part of small businesses and we're seeing that reflected in parts of our business. In other parts of the business the results are mixed because we do, I think, see as a result of the fact that 50% of the PEO's business comes from referrals of our existing payroll sales force, to the extent that that sales force is encountering some slower decision-making, particularly in the midmarket, and also encountering some slow decision-making as a result of uncertainty about ACA that is expected to have and is having some impact on the PEO. But to be clear, the weakness in the revenue growth of the PEO was almost exclusively the pass-through revenues and lower inflation in health benefits and a slight slowing in benefits participation which is probably also related to a, quote unquote, peaking of ACA implementations. And by that I mean that we have seen several year decline in benefits participation rate, in other words how many eligible employees of the PEO actually take benefits and that sort of the trend upward as we got closer to the deadline. So the last, call it, two years right before ACA, given the fact that the law was intended to increase participation and companies were coming to the PEO in order to comply with the law, we saw those participation rates trend up. And now we saw the increase in the second quarter be a smaller increase than in the prior second quarter and in the quarters before that. So that slowing trend of benefits participation coupled with lower inflation of benefits per worksite employee is what led to slower growth, if you will, in the PEO, but the 12% worksite employee growth is still very, very strong, so we're still very happy with what we consider to be net revenue growth in the PEO which is now growing almost in line with worksite employees whereas historically had grown a little bit faster because of this pass-through cost pressure. So I hope that helps a little bit... Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I just have one piece of information for you, Tim, is the average client size in the PEO is now around mid 40s, so it spans really the small business space as well as our midmarket up to a couple hundred employees per client, so it's affected by performance in down and midmarket in its growth. Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then just following up on the comment about the mid to upper markets, I understand retention was a little better overall for you, so you retained existing customers, but do you have enough data to know that \u2013 I guess, it was slower decision-making or a lack of decision by clients versus competitive win losses on new opportunities that had an impact this quarter? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: We monitor obviously our competitive position in the market space and I think we have seen performance competitively according to our expectations. One element that Carlos had not mentioned is, I think, our sales force has reported relatively strong pipelines overall throughout these months, so it was really not due to a lack of interest, but it was really what we felt a slowing of the decision-making process as we forecasted certainly, but also those things together, solid competitive position as well as good pipeline gave us basically the basis for the forecast that we just made. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: And it's certainly isn't for lack of head count, so we're in a strong position from a sales force capability standpoint. And I think if your question was really around did our retention \u2013 I think, you started off by asking about retention, did retention benefit from slower decision, that's possible. So it is possible that on the other side of the coin, if you will, people didn't make as many decisions than we were able to hold on to clients, it'd have very difficult for us to measure that, but it's possible. Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great, thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Berkley of Barclays. Your line is now open. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, guys. Thanks a lot for taking my questions, just real quick here, you've seen about 200 basis points margin expansion during the first two quarters of the year. Obviously, when it compares to your guidance, are up 50 basis points and implies a meaningful contraction in the second half. Could you just walk us through the drivers of that and the contribution to margins perhaps that are tied to ACA products in the quarter or anything else that you'd like to call out? And then just kind of keeping with that theme, you've talked about pass-through pressure being better than anticipated, helping to drive margin expansion there. And so just thinking about margins overall with PEO growing much faster than Employer Services which has got a meaningfully lower margin, how do we think about the sustainability of like 50 basis points a year over time? Like what's ultimately driving expansion against the PEO headwind? Thanks. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: James, that is a fairly comprehensive margin question, I would say. So let me start, I think you are isolating some of the factors that create more margin pressure in the second half of our fiscal year. So number one is the easier compare that we had in the first half of the fiscal year due to our ACA related investments is clear. So in the beginning of 2016 fiscal year we had largely selling and implementation expense for ACA and then we started to receive revenues for these products in the third and fourth quarter of last fiscal year. And so the upcoming quarters don't have that easier compare and so the margin expansion that we experienced in the first two quarters is not going to repeat itself due to the growing into our more steady ACA revenue base. Secondly, we expect of course sales to grow as we indicated in our prepared remarks, and so that means of course also selling expense is anticipated to grow and in this case contribute to the margin pressure. And we're also continuing our investments into product and innovation, which is in this case at an equal basis contributing to the margin pressure. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think we also have \u2013 I think our expectation is a little bit of a return of the growth of the PEO pass-through cost, which I think that just mathematically also adds to \u2013 I think the last part of your question was a broad PEO margin pressure question about ADP, but in this first half, second half it is a factor. Based on our current forecast, just the expectation for our pass-through cost for the second half alone causes some pressure in the second half. And I think your broader question about overall pressure is a very, very good question which we spend a lot of time looking at and talking about. But this year in particular, because of lower benefits inflation costs, we actually, as you could tell from the first half of the year, it actually helped us. It took some of the pressure that we had historically had off. So even though the PEO has an absolute lower margin, the fact that its margin has been improving as much as it has combined with the slower growth of pass-through costs made this a moot point for the first two quarters of this year. And I think what you have from us is a commitment to really make sure that we have a lot of transparency around because we do a lot of what-if scenarios around the next two to three years what the PEO margin expectation is versus the ES margin expectation and the overall ADP. And we feel comfortable at least right now that we are in a place where we're able to still achieve the guidance that we've provided on a long-term basis, but over time that could change. If we have a lot of inflation and pass-through costs, we might have to revisit that topic just because of the pure mathematics, not because of the quality of the business or the strength of the business, just because of the math that I think you're implying. But I think for now, I think we're in an okay position. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks a lot, that's really helpful. I know I threw a lot at you there. Just real quick, a much shorter question, just what's driving the unchanged EPS guide? That was obviously nice to see. You raised it last quarter, and you were able to keep it steady here despite declining top line. Is it just tax rate and a step up in buybacks versus prior expectations or maybe some conservatism on your end in the past, or something else that maybe I'm missing? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: No, I think that \u2013 Jan may have something to add, but we had a great quarter earnings-wise, so that helps because we obviously provide guidance based on what we really think is going to happen. And as I think we were clear in our comments, the second quarter exceeded our expectation. So in fairness, we got a little bit of tailwind from the second quarter going into \"maintaining\" our guidance for the year on earnings. So I think we feel good about where we are in terms of our expenses, even though Jan described very well this issue of we've lapped our ACA revenues, and we had already lapped our ACA expenses for the last two quarters. So those kind of factors are what helped boost the margins in the first two quarters of the fiscal year which we don't get in the second two quarters of the fiscal year. But in general when we look at the quality and the trajectory of the business, we feel pretty good other than this issue in new business bookings, which ironically helps our margin in the first half of the fiscal year. Other than that factor, we feel pretty good about where we are. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks a lot. I appreciate your time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee of RBC. Your line is now open. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, guys. Good morning. Let me follow that up with one more question about margins. Can you give us a sense, how much of the margin improvement this quarter was the operating efficiencies versus the lower sales commissions? I noticed you said them in that order. So was that done by design based on the impact? And then what were the costs in the quarter and the first half I guess for the service alignment changes? And is it still that the vast majority of that cost has not happened yet happens in the back half? Thank you. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Let me start about the Service Alignment Initiative. The Service Alignment Initiative causes us in the fiscal year to take a restructuring charge of approximately $100 million throughout, and we took the first 40-some million dollars in the first quarter and just very little in the second quarter. In addition to those restructuring costs, we incur about a 20 bps margin pressure through dual operations, which is not part of the non-GAAP measure. And that is incurring throughout the fiscal year, so there's not a great variation in this throughout. The second question to you, about 0.5%, a little less than 0.5% of the margin improvement in the first half is due to our lower MDE \u2013 our lower selling expense \u2013 selling and marketing expense in the first half, and then about 120 basis points was operating efficiencies of scale. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. And then just a quick follow-up, on the bookings, is there any way to have any confidence that this is really short-term driven related to uncertainty around the election rather than the changes that come out of the new administration dampening demand for the product? So the overtime rules, ACA you've already been clear on. I think we understand that. But do you get that kind of color from clients, or is it more you think just no one wanted to step up because there was and probably still is so much uncertainty? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: While we have noodled this question now a number of ways, I tried to add a few elements to it. If the changes in economic policy lead to sustained economic growth, that is the most important driver for our success of new business bookings. So if the belief that is currently I guess reflected in bullish equity markets and other things, business confidence comes true, I think that will be naturally a good thing because we are positively correlated to good economic environment, and good employment helps ADP. So the fundamental \u2013 that's the most important driver for our new business bookings growth is a healthy economic environment. Now economic \u2013 changes in the regulatory environment contribute maybe to economic growth and they also contribute to change in regulatory requirements in the HR space, which help ADP. I would guess that change will happen over time and the number of changes that are coming down to our clients is high, so I don't think there's a principal change in need for compliance solutions in the HR space to be foreseen in any near-term future. So net-net, I think, if the economic positive outcome materializes, I think that will be good news for ADP overall and we remain confident in our ability to sell. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Jan, I think to add to that, I think we have some historical data to support Jan's points like, obviously, we don't have any historical data to really be able to ascertain what's happening, what month and with what regulation. But the first point about the economy is indisputable that when ADP is obviously a very \u2013 from a recurring revenue model standpoint on our revenues and our profitability and so forth a relatively defensive steady company, but new business bookings is a little bit different. And when you look at 20 years of data, our new business bookings growth over the course of rolling four quarters because obviously any one quarter can have issues like we just experienced. We can have a new regulation that requires a new product. We had for example Y2K 20 years ago but, in general, follows very, very closely almost a smooth line what's happening with the economy, as does our pays per control growth. So our pays per control growth when unemployment is going up, tends to go down and vice versa. So we are in new business bookings, I think, somewhat tied to the strength of the economy and so, as Jan said \u2013 and we are, obviously, we try to be as transparent as possible. We were sitting here talking about potentially entering a recession. We would have to, I think, temper our optimism based on that 20 years of history. But since that doesn't appear to be the environment that we're entering at least for now, we feel that we're going to rely on this historical data and I think plan on returning to historical growth rates in our new business, and our new business bookings. In terms of this issue of the specific regulations and change and so forth, there's also a lot of history in ADP. There's more than 20 years of history where even though there are bumps along the road in terms of the amount of regulation and the type of regulation, in general the trajectory has been in one direction. And that's a global statement, not just a U.S. statement because governments try to effect public policy through employment and through employers, whether it's around safety, or taxes, or a variety of healthcare in this case. And so we like where we are, we like the space we operate in, and we're optimistic about, I think, the future, although obviously, we're not exactly happy about what's happening in the short term here. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great, thank you. I appreciate all color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis of Bernstein. Your line is now open. Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, guys. Can you talk about the timeline and monetization model for the rollout of your reporting and benchmarking modules? Exactly where they are in terms of rolling out and just directionally what the magnitude is that you expect coming in from those modules in terms of new business bookings and revenues over time? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Lisa, yeah, our big data and analytics capabilities we view as one of our strategic differentiators in our product set. And we're planning actually to capture the benefit of this capability that is quite unique in a variety of methods. And the most fundamental is that we're going to be incorporating many of those analytics, benchmarking and predictive analytics, into our core product and differentiate the core bundle with a better solution. So for example, data and DataCloud is an integral part of our Vantage offering and is available to all Vantage clients, and is part of what makes Vantage a differentiated product. In the mid-market we're selling it as an incremental module for now, and clients buy it on a recurring revenue basis. We have a few thousand clients having bought the product in the last 12 months or so. So we're kind of in the very early stages of rolling out these capabilities to it. I encourage everybody to think about the data analytics capability as a broad differentiator that will not only affect our core product for our clients, will improve our service and implementation capabilities, and will be \u2013 we're kind of right now in the very beginning stages of seeing those benefits coming through. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: And I think \u2013 I'll just add that I think we are working on these types of products and others in order to drive not just incremental revenue from the products themselves, but to gain market share and to win more new business. Because the reality is that when we wake up every morning we're thinking about how you grow over $1.75 billion in new business bookings. And to give you a specific answer like in the next year or two we don't plan on sharing on this call that it had the same impact as ACA. Because again, the numbers are just so large that unless we simultaneously generate incremental revenues from new products, while driving \u2013 using those new products to drive better differentiation and more net new wins in the marketplace to gain market share, then we're not going to be able to grow the business. I think Jan described it well which is it's a very broad strategy around differentiation and strengthening our products, as well as we don't mind earning a little bit of extra revenue and income from selling those types of products. Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Terrific. Thanks, and then just quickly for my follow-up, can you give the 20 second update on the Workforce Now migrations and whether you're still on track to finish them by the end of the year? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yes, we're still on track. We feel pretty good. I think, Jan, may have the... Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: We're steered away from the digital numbers here, but we're committed to substantially complete the migrations in our-market space by the end of the fiscal year. And I think we're going to have a few stragglers into the first quarter, but substantially we are on plan with those migrations. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: And very excited about it. Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang, JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Good morning. Just, I guess, on the bookings front, have you changed your assumption on bookings specific to selling additional ACA modules? I think in the past, you've said that you've sold about half your ACA base already there. Does this shift to flat bookings cover that? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yes, it does. So one big chunk, of course, is the adjustment to our selling expense expectations that we had for that product. As you might imagine that is significantly down and our new guidance incorporates that thinking. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. Thanks, Jan. And then on the \u2013 just the acquisition of the Marcus research \u2013 Buckingham, is it more of a people-based, so I get the technology side of it. But it seems like they do some consulting and perhaps some people-based services as well at this Marcus Buckingham Company. I'm just curious if you can give a little more on the addition there? Thank you. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: So we like it so much because there's a service component in addition to a technology component which actually fits well with our business model, so you're right. There is a \u2013 they have deep, deep data analytics and insights in their own business, and so there's a lot of research-based, data-driven decision-making in how they deliver their products. I think the belief by them and by us is that we have obviously a very big data set to be able to enhance the work that they do to really help people create a better workforce. And so I think the combination of the coaching, the data and the analytics along with combining that with ADP, I think, we think that we could really do something special here. So again, caution that given the $12 billion of revenue, if it wasn't obvious from our comments, this is not an immediate game changer from a revenue growth standpoint, but it's an immediate game changer from a strategic standpoint and from a brand standpoint. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. Yeah, no. It seems powerful to put on top of your platform. Thank you. Go ahead. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Grossman of Stifel. Your line is now open. David Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp.: Thank you. So just to put the bookings provision in context, it seems that everything else being equal the impact is less than $100 million of annualized revenue given the booking space. Are we thinking about that right? And I know it's still early, but is there anything else we should think about in the context of next year's revenue growth trajectory other than obviously the easier comparison? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: No. I think that that's as good a math as \u2013 for example, when we had some challenges with retention in the last year, that's kind of the way to look at things is to use simple math to put things in perspective. And so we obviously fully expect to return to stronger new business bookings growth as these compares get a little bit easier and hopefully as some of this uncertainty wears off, but I think that your math is dead on, which is why you hear us still remaining optimistic. We would obviously prefer to have $100 million then to not have the $100 million, but I think in the context of what we're trying to accomplish for the company from a value generation standpoint, EPS, share buybacks, et cetera, it really doesn't \u2013 for now, it doesn't have a major impact. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: And, David, while that quantitative estimate is that kind of scopes it, but obviously, key assumptions for revenue growth also are impacted by your belief in retention as well as we pointed out in this point of time of year, in particular around the pass-through revenue growth of the POE, those would be the two other factors that I think could have meaningful or somehow an impact on your revenue growth expectations for the longer term. David Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp.: Right. And then just secondly, and I may have missed this, you may have mentioned this, but I was just looking, pays per control were roughly in line with trends, so just trying to understand the context of where the weakness was, if you can call this out? But was it primarily in unit growth? Or was it revenue per client? Or is it just kind of both without any real noticeable trend? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: You're referring to new business bookings? Or... David Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp.: Yes. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I'm not sure I understand, sorry, the question. The... Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think we indicated that we had new business bookings weakness in the mid and up market. That was stronger impacted by the slowing of the buying decisions. And if you refer \u2013 I think, I can tell you that our client growth continues to be very solid, mostly driven by our success in the down market, so really very nice performance in the small business market with unit growth. So mathematically, I guess, what it boils down is a mix of all of that together. David Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp.: Okay. So just then looking at the mid and up market then, Jan, was there any real distinction between unit growth and revenue per client in terms of the shortfall? Or was it just a combination of both? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: No. Not really. Not a change. I think both fell a little bit short. Clearly, it's always clouded right now by this difficult compare about the ACA, and we have emphasized this in a number of calls. The ACA modules themselves are easy to identify, but ACA has triggered a lot of buying decisions for broader product bundles. And it's hard to analytically differentiate between what was the true ACA impact and what was just enhanced buying cycles because this triggered a buying event in what was just regular course of business. So we're a little bit hesitant to say that. But overall, in the mid and upmarket, I think we have seen continuation of trends and new logo growth as we call it and upselling. It's just at a lower level. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Jan, I think that \u2013 sorry. Maybe I didn't at first understand the question, but I did look last night at sales force productivity over the last few years. And as you can imagine, now our average productivity per sales rep is down, but largely driven by ACA. If you exclude ACA, our sales productivity is still in line with our expectations. So I think what we've had is we had \u2013 and I think we've been every quarter I think very, very clear. We haven't been pretending that it was either sustainable or that we had done something magical to all of a sudden create such a huge increase in productivity in our sales force. I wish we had. Clearly, we got help from and lift from ACA sales. We had two years of 13% and 12% new business bookings growth, fiscal years, and I don't know the last time that we had ever done that. So clearly, maybe we didn't emphasize enough how much help we were getting. And certainly now it's difficult to go back to the sales force and remind them that we had help and now the help isn't there anymore. We've got to now focus on fundamentals. We've got to go back to selling new clients and the old-fashioned approach of ADP of having a reasonable mix of head count growth and productivity growth. And I think when I look through the numbers and try to normalize for ACA, we feel pretty good about where we are in terms of head count and also sales force productivity. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great, thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Ridley-Lane, Bank of America. Your line is now open. David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Sure, good morning. Over the last few years, ADP has leaned pretty heavily on regulatory and compliance offerings. As the U.S. labor market looks to tighten and perhaps wage inflation picks up, what are some of the more growth-oriented offerings that you have for clients? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: It's actually a fantastic question because this afternoon I'm actually going to speak to our midmarket sales force about some of the things that we can and need to do in terms of getting ourselves reset here for a different environment. I think, as we said multiple times today, we're not going to a zero regulation environment. So 99% of the laws and regulations that affect employers are still in place today that were in place two months ago, and they're probably going to be in place a year and five years from now, and there may be new ones. And so we have always been there to help our clients with compliance and with regulation. Having said that, we're clearly entering a period of time with tightening labor markets where I think many employers' attention is going to turn to how to attract and retain a workforce. And this is something that we've been building to over the last four to five, six, seven years by investing in our talent management suites. by investing in tools to help our clients use data and analytics to run their business better and manage a better workforce. So we've been preparing fortunately for this strategic opportunity here for many years, and it's coming and it's coming fast because I believe we reported the ADP Employment Report this morning, and that's only going to add to I think the tighter labor markets. Because as we've seen multiple times in the last 20 to 30 years, as unemployment gets to the level that it's at now and we understand that there might still be a little bit of slack as a result of labor force participation, but that slack will also inevitably come out of the system, whether it's in 6 months or in 12 months. It may have already come out, we don't know. But besides higher interest rates, which are going to be beneficial to ADP, we think this is going to be beneficial to ADP's new business bookings and to our approach to the market, which is to help our clients and products exactly with this topic. How do you attract and retain the best workforce when everyone else is trying to do the same thing? So we're not ready to say there's a war for talent yet, but clearly there are pockets of that. And I think when that happens, I think some of the products and solutions that we've developed, this acquisition that we've just done with TMBC, I think, position us well to help our clients with that. David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. And then I know that the revenue contribution from the acquisition is pretty small, but bigger picture you've been focused mainly on organic development over the last few years. Should we read this acquisition as potentially suggesting you're open to a bit more tuck-in acquisitions going forward? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think we always have maintained a position that we view our balance sheet and our capital strength as one of our assets, and we have been evaluating and looking at acquisitions all along. And so you should anticipate that we'll keep an open mind around those going forward, and they will need now a joint evaluation of augmenting us strategically, like the talent management acquisition of Marcus Buckingham fits right into this talent search, manage your workforce better, so strategically fitting well, but also not adding in a disproportionate way to the complexity of our operations as we have focused so much to simplify our varying environment. And we're going to, as a management team, evaluate those acquisitions to maximize the value really eventually for the shareholder over time. David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And we have time for one more question. Our last question comes from the line of Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. This is Ashish Sabadra calling on behalf of Bryan Keane. Just to follow up on questions regarding the ACA, the new administration is pretty keen on repealing the ACA, and I was wondering. Is there a way to quantify what percentage of ADP's existing revenue may be directly or indirectly linked to ACA, like the ACA module or other revenues which may be linked to ACA and could be potentially impacted by the repeal? Thanks. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: We have reported that last year we filed for approximately 10 million employees 1095 forms, so that gives you a rough revenue estimate, between $150 million and $200 million of ACA revenue in our business. But it is with very \u2013 we have to be very thoughtful about what will happen to them. Clearly, it could go away, but it could also maintain new solutions, certain reporting requirements which are at the core of the value proposition of the ACA. So we at this point are really not in a position to estimate what part of this revenue is at risk or if there could be even further growth in that ACA revenue, but it gives you a rough estimate about the size of our directly ACA-related revenues, about $150 million to $200 million. Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks a lot. Thanks for the color. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: So as we mentioned, obviously some of the uncertainties that have been created as a result of this change in administration and the talk about repeal and replace of ACA are certainly not helping us in terms of our new business bookings here in the second quarter, but we still are pretty positive about our business model. I think you've heard that from us today that we're well positioned for helping our clients with what are becoming very, very tight labor markets, and we're also optimistic that there will be some change. We know there's going to be change, so repeal is clearly in the eye of the beholder, but given that there's a commitment to maintaining 20 million Americans on insurance we believe there will be some new form of tracking of regulation and that we will have something that we can help our clients with if not the current ACA products that we have today. In the meantime, we're going to rely on our historical track record of being able to navigate through obviously these uncertain times and wait for the inevitable pickup in the economic activity as well as government activity around some of these changes. We continue to invest in simplifying our portfolio, as Jan said, including using that as one of the criteria for acquisitions. You've heard us talk about how we're aligning our service model. We're very excited about what that's going to do for the quality and long term cost of our service, and as you heard from us today, we're certainly not backing down on our distribution channel. So we continue to invest in our sales force and grow our sales force because we plan on continuing to grow. So we appreciate your time today. Thank you for joining us, and we appreciate your interest in ADP. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. That does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Operator : Good morning. My name is Crystal, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to ADP's Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded, and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now turn the conference over to Mr. Christian Greyenbuhl, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Christian Greyenbuhl - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you, Crystal, and good morning, everyone. This is Christian Greyenbuhl, ADP's Vice President, Investor Relations. I'm here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call and webcast. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, as such, involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current excitations. Now, let me turn the call over to Carlos. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you, Christian, and thank you all for joining our call this morning. We appreciate your interest in ADP. Today, we released our third quarter fiscal 2017 results, with reported revenue growth of 5% to $3.4 billion. This revenue growth includes about 1 percentage point of pressure from the second quarter disposition of our spending accounts in COBRA businesses. Our diluted earnings per share grew 12% to $1.31. Jan will take you through the key contributing factors to our performance in more detail shortly. Our new business bookings this quarter declined by 7%, as we continued to overcome the strong fiscal 2016 sales of solutions that assist our clients in complying with the Affordable Care Act. I'd like to remind you that the Affordable Care Act factor was quite unique and that it helped accelerate various buying decisions across our mid- and upmarkets, both from new client share and our existing base. Nevertheless, our pipeline of HCM opportunities continues to be strong, as we leverage our investments in our strategic cloud platforms, Vantage and Workforce Now. Now, let me discuss client retention. As we reported, retention declined 170 basis points for the quarter. The losses that contributed to this decline were concentrated on our legacy platforms, and we believe some of these losses were triggered by our upgrade activities in the mid- and upmarket. We maintain our core belief that these migrations are the right thing to do for our clients as well as for ADP. Our midmarket migrations are anticipated to be completed by the end of this calendar year, while the migration efforts upmarket will be phased in over time in partnership with our clients. Client satisfaction and retention remains high on our strategic platforms, and we are seeing that with our midmarket Workforce Now platform. The feedback from clients on this platform has been positive. In fact, a report from G2 Crowd, a leading business solutions review platform, recently added ADP Workforce Now to its Best Software 2017 list in the Core HR category. This list is based exclusively on feedback from users of the product. We ranked highest for ease-of-use, quality of support, which is especially gratifying given our focus on service and the user experience. ADP's success over the past 68 years is tied to our ability to keep pace with our clients' evolving needs across economic cycles. As our recent workforce vitality report indicated, the labor market continues to be robust, and we see our clients becoming increasingly focused on talent, finding, retaining and engaging critical staff in a much more competitive environment. Our recent acquisition of the Marcus Buckingham Company, which we completed in the third quarter, is an example of our commitment to assist clients in meeting their talent needs. When it comes to talent and performance management, we know the needs of each client and each team are unique. By adding TMBC's content, coaching and technology solutions to the ADP portfolio, we now offer a suite of proven products to help leaders unleash the talent of their teams and create value for our clients. We've talked before about our focus on the user experience and delivering solutions that our clients and their employees find easier and more intuitive to use. We've applied that same thinking to our channel partners with the introduction of ADP Accountant Connect. We're particularly proud of the continued strength and robust growth of our downmarket, where we now have over 500,000 clients on our RUN platform. And this unique solution provides our accountant channel partners with a unified view of payroll as well as reporting and tax information for all our shared clients. This solution was developed in collaboration with our accountant channel partners to meet their needs and has already been recognized by Accountant Today (sic) [Accounting Today] (5:41) as one its 2017 top new products in the accountant resources category. We believe solutions like ADP Accountant Connect will help further enhance our relationships with this important referral channel while creating a better experience for our shared clients. We are also pleased to recently receive recognition from NelsonHall, a global BPO analyst firm, who identified ADP as a leader in payroll services for the fourth consecutive year. In naming us a leader, the NelsonHall report highlighted our global reach and the breadth of our service offering, allowing clients ranging from small businesses to global enterprises to choose how much expertise they wish to retain in-house or to outsource. In its report, NelsonHall also recognized ADP's ability to help clients benchmark their workforce metrics against industry averages using the ADP data cloud. And they also recognize the ADP Marketplace, which helps clients access an ecosystem of enterprise applications from ADP and our partners to extend the value of their HCM solutions. It's great to be recognized in the industry, but it's also great when we see our company recognized more broadly, which is why I was especially proud to see Fortune magazine name us to their Most Admired Companies' list for the 11th time and rank us number one in our category for the fifth straight time. I'm particularly proud of this because it's a testament to the confidence our stakeholders place in us and to the continued dedication of our 57,000 associates. In closing, despite the pressure on new business bookings and retention, we remain confident in the enduring qualities of our business. We are pleased with the continued strong performance of our PEO and multinational solutions and with our improving service metrics within the midmarket. We are especially pleased with our success in the downmarket, which continues to demonstrate the value of our strategy to deliver great technology and great service. We are confident that this strategy is the right one to help our clients succeed, which will in turn drive sustained growth for ADP. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan for further review of our third quarter results and an update on the fiscal 2017 outlook. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you very much, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. ADP revenues for the quarter grew 5% on a reported basis, 6% organic. Our revenue growth this quarter experienced pressure as we began to lap our fiscal year 2016 ACA-related revenues. Pre-tax earnings from continuing operations before taxes grew 4% on a reported basis to $828 million, despite almost 2 percentage points of combined pressure from our second quarter business disposition and our fiscal year 2017 acquisitions. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT grew 4%. Adjusted EBIT margin decreased about 20 basis points, compared to 24.8% in last year's third quarter. Our margins this quarter were impacted by slower revenue growth as we maintain our investments and product sales and service, including dual operations cost related to our service alignment initiative. Our net earnings grew 10% on a reported basis to $588 million and benefited from a lower effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate this quarter was aided by an incremental tax benefit related to prior period software development efforts, $0.04 of which was not previously anticipated and $0.02 tax benefit related to the adoption of new stock-based compensation accounting guidance. Diluted earnings per share grew 12% to $1.31 and benefited from fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. Our new business bookings performance this quarter was disappointing. However, we have continued to make investments into our sales organization to better position us for growth. We're confident in the competitiveness of our portfolio and the strength of our distribution capabilities, and in turn, our ability to execute on our pipeline of market opportunities. In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 2% on a reported basis for the quarter and included 1 percentage points of pressure from the sale of our CHSA and COBRA businesses earlier this fiscal year. Our same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.5% in the third quarter. Average client fund balances grew 2% on a reported basis, or 3% on a constant dollar basis compared to a year ago. As a result of improving employment, we have continued to see pressure from lower state unemployment insurance collections impact client fund balances. This pressure was offset by a combination of wage inflation and growth in our pays per control metric. Employer Services margin decreased about 40 basis points in the quarter. This decrease was driven by slower revenue growth as we maintain our investments and product sales and service, including dual operations related to our service alignment initiative. PEO revenues grew 12% in the quarter with average worksite employees growing 12% to 471,000. The PEO continued to experience slowing growth in the benefit pass-through costs, resulting from lower health care renewal premiums, which outweighed growth from higher benefit plan participation of our worksite employees during the quarter. The PEO margins continued to expand through operational efficiencies, which helped drive approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. New business bookings this quarter were down 7%. And as a result, we now expect new business bookings for fiscal year 2017 to decline about 5% to 7% compared to the $1.75 billion sold in fiscal year 2016. We have also updated certain other elements of our fiscal 2017 forecast, which I will now take you through. Despite our revised new business bookings guidance and this quarter's revenue retention decline, our revenue outlook remains unchanged at about 6%. This forecast continues to include 1 percentage point of combined pressure from the sale of our CHSA and COBRA businesses and the impacts from foreign currency. While Employer Services segment consistent with our prior forecast, revenue growth is anticipated to be 3% to 4%, which continues to include 1 percentage point of combined pressure from the sale of our CHSA and COBRA businesses and the impacts from foreign currency. For the PEO, ADP continues to anticipate revenue growth of 13%. We continue to expect our consolidated adjusted EBIT margin expansion to be about 50 basis points, which includes about 20 basis points of pressure from dual operations pertaining to our service alignment initiative, which was not part of our non-GAAP charges. On a segment level, we continue to anticipate margin expansion in Employer Services of 25 basis points to 50 basis points. For the PEO, we expect continued operating efficiencies and slower growth in our pass-through revenues as compared to fiscal year 2016 to help drive margin expansion on a full year basis. Accordingly, we continue to expect fiscal year 2017 PEO margin expansion of at least 100 basis points. We are also now expecting growth in client funds interest revenue to increase to about $20 million compared with our prior forecasted increase of about $15 million. The total impact from the client funds extended investment strategy is now expected to be up about $15 million compared to the prior forecast of about $10 million. The details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. As a result of the software development related tax benefit, some of which was not previously contemplated in our prior guidance and the additional benefit related to the stock-based compensation accounting change, we now estimate our adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 to be 31.4% as compared to our prior forecasted rate of 32.4%. Based upon our revision of our effective tax rate guidance; adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow 13% to 14% compared to our prior forecast of 11% to 13%. Our forecast also continues to contemplate a return of excess cash to shareholders via share repurchases of $1.2 billion to $1. 4 billion, subject to market conditions during fiscal year 2017. This forecast includes any repurchases required to offset dilution related to employee benefit plans. So, with that, I will turn the call back to our operator to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will take our first question from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC : Thank you. Good morning. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Good morning. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC : Last quarter \u2013 I'm thinking of it as the December quarter \u2013 you showed an improvement in client retention, I believe, 10 basis points; in this quarter, the March quarter, down 170 basis points. What was the major change between the December quarter and the March quarter that led to that decline in client revenue retention? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think as we mentioned, I think, in our opening comments, it was concentrated in our legacy platforms in the midmarket and in the upmarket. It was particularly skewed towards the upmarket this quarter. Some of the losses, as you know, we don't provide guidance. And in the December quarter, we wouldn't have talked about forward-looking retention. But some of the deterioration that we experienced in the quarter was anticipated as a result of some known large losses. We typically have reasonable amount of visibility, sometimes several quarters, if not a year or more, for very large clients when they are moving off of one of our solutions. But I guess the core message we are trying to deliver in our comments is that it continues to be concentrated in our legacy platforms. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC : Understood. And just as a quick follow-up, it would seem that the decline in new bookings this year and some of the pressure on client revenue retention would be more consequential for fiscal 2018 given the way your revenue model works. Can you give us some preliminary thoughts about fiscal 2018 based on the retention trends and the booking trends you're seeing in FY 2017? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think you're right about the way the math works for our business. And I think that's why Jan was very clear in kind of reaffirming our guidance for, obviously, the rest of the year, because we're so far into the year that these variations and retention in sales have very low impact on the current next quarter and even maybe one quarter after that. But clearly, going forward, for the next fiscal year, it does roll into the math in terms of that waterfall chart that we've shared with you. As you know, we don't provide guidance for fiscal year 2018 until our August call. So we're really in the middle of our operating plan process and we'll obviously have better information then in terms of how that waterfall chart exactly falls through in terms of the various factors that impact our revenue growth in fiscal year 2018. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think that's true. But, David, you're mathematically correct that our new business bookings get implemented and turn into revenue after six months approximately and so some of the impact of our lower retention and lower sales will be seen in the revenue growth next year, as you roll it forward. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC : Understood. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Eskelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just the first one, if I heard you correctly, it sounded like the midmarket client migrations have been pushed out by two quarters. The question, I guess, is why have you pushed that out? And then expanding on that a little bit further, as you're starting, it sounds like with the upmarket \u2013 how has what you've seen in midmarket colored your expectations and how you are going to approach the upmarket? Thank you. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah. I think, you're right about the timing that we were hoping that we would be done. I think our wording was that we would be done somewhere around the end of this fiscal year. And so, now we're saying by the end of the calendar year. Realistically, we really don't do migrations in November and December because we have year-end and a lot of activities going on. So it's really a few months and its a few clients or a few thousand clients, because in the midmarket, we're talking about clients in the thousands. And just as a reminder, there were tens of thousands. I think the total number of client migrations was somewhere around 50,000 or 60,000 clients. And so what we're talking about is, I would say, a couple of thousand stragglers that we felt, in order to just meet an artificial deadline wasn't worth. We learned our lesson, I think, a year-and-a-half ago around when we had to accelerate, in some cases we were forced to accelerate migrations as a result of ACA to get clients on our new platform in order to be able to give them that solution. We learned through that process that you want to really truly upgrade the clients and have them feel that it's an upgrade, not a forced march or a negative experience. And so we're just focused on making sure that it's the right kind of experience and we felt like a couple of thousand clients falling over from one fiscal year to the other is really not that big of a deal in our minds. And I think it's the right thing to do. And I think, to answer your question about how that experience colors our approach in the upmarket, again, I think we learned some lessons in terms of making sure that we do things at the proper pace, and that we do it in partnership with our clients. And I think that becomes much more important in the upmarket where it's much more complex, and clients have, in many cases, provide a lot of their own internal resources in order to make a migration happen. In the small market, when we did those migrations, there was very little effort and very little need for clients to be involved. In the midmarket, there was a little bit more effort and a little more involvement by the clients. And in the upmarket, there's quite a lot of involvement. And hence, it has to be much more carefully planned and, hence, you're probably hearing from us that it's going to be a longer process in terms of getting those upgrades completed. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Then just a follow-up, as you've had a little more time in the new service delivery geographies, how was the ability to find talent then? How is it compared to your expectations for shifting to those locations? Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think it's fair to say that we are \u2013 and again, we're early in our goals here. But really, we're on track. So we're actually quite pleased. We've got several thousand people already hired in our new locations in Orlando, in Maitland, which is near Orlando; in Norfolk, Virginia; and we're already hiring also in Tempe. And it is in addition to Augusta and El Paso where we already had two strategic locations. And we have a couple of other key locations, but those are the ones that we've been talking the most about regarding our strategic alignment initiative. So I'd say we're pleased with the talent, we're pleased with the pace. I think we're on plan in terms of the number of people we were intending to hire. We're on plan in terms of the wage levels and the quality of the talent. I have obviously visited, and I think Jan, we've all visited these locations. In fact, we had a very large associate town hall meeting in our Norfolk, Virginia location. And it may be a honeymoon phase but it's an incredibly energetic environment. People are very positive and very bullish on ADP. I think we're considered a great employer in the markets that we are entering. And we've got a lot of help from other parts of the organization getting these folks trained and ready to be able to actually deliver service, and in some cases they obviously already are. And that's why we have some of these dual operations cost that Jan has referred to a couple of times, because we're trying to make sure that we do this in a very careful and methodical way. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Good morning. Thanks as always for all the disclosure. Just a couple of questions. Just on the pricing front, on successfully migrating clients to the new strategic platforms, any surprises there? Did that contribute at all to the bookings forecast? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Just to be clear, when we migrate our clients, the migration itself is not counting as a new business booking because business bookings account only incremental recurring revenue that we report. So the migration is generally cost-neutral to our clients, and they have enhanced feature functionality with a new product that they get. In the process, clients continue to make buying decisions and buy incremental modules as they do, and we have seen that trend continue in particular in the midmarket. But the actual migration is revenue-neutral, as we approach it, and that will be the same for all upmarket clients. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Thanks for that clarification. I wasn't sure if the change might get captured in the (24:26) business bookings. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah. So the change \u2013 if a client buys more, I don't have the most recent statistics here, but I think the trends continue that a number of clients purchases incremental modules as they see the power of the integrated platform. And so there is some slight revenue uptick that we do see for the clients who choose it and only that incremental revenue would be reflected. But it would be immaterial for the new business bookings number in total. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. One more quick follow-up. I know Jan because you've been sort of, I guess, signaling or suggesting that some of these things could happen with ACA. But I'm just curious, just looking back now, is some of the reduction in this bookings outlook \u2013 is there a way to quantify how much might be related to the weak follow-through on ACA module sales and the related tough comp on ACA modules versus maybe a pull-forward of broader payroll HCM sales related to ACA? Do you follow my question? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I do. And I think that it is \u2013 as I think we've been trying to signal for, I think, probably three years if you go back to my notes, it's very hard because we're obviously in uncharted territories, because we were in something completely new. And it was a very comprehensive regulatory framework that required a lot of information from HR platforms, payroll platforms, benefit platforms, et cetera. And when you look back, we had two years of more than 12% new business bookings growth. And this is why we were cautious all along because that is a little strong. We were happy with it and we take it. It's good for our shareholders. It's good for ADP. It's good for our revenues. But it definitely felt like a fairly significant tailwind. And I think, in hindsight, it was obviously a big tailwind. Now, what has now added, I think, potentially to that pressure, which again we can't quantify scientifically is that we have, I think, a different environment politically that's creating some uncertainty, that certainly has impacted our new business bookings. We just can't put our finger on exactly to what extent. So as an example, we knew we had a grow-over issue just for ACA itself because we had already sold 50% of our addressable client base. But we did have some planned sales of ACA this year. And even though we've gotten some, it's significantly lower than plan, which is not surprising given the headlines and the frequent votes on repeal and replace of ACA. And so I think that's a second factor that I think was not certainly anticipated as we entered into this fiscal year in terms of our planning process. We knew we had to grow over the mathematical grow-over issue. Now we have what I would call the political issue. And then the third one that you mentioned, which again, is very hard for us to put our finger on, but I think you're onto something because we experienced the same thing back when we had the Y2K phenomenon in year 2000, where you do have some amount of pull forward, if you will, of business because we've seen this particularly on some of our wins last year from ERPs were quite high and elevated. And I think some of that, it appears, with the benefit of hindsight is, people on kind of older legacy technology trying to find a new solution for ACA. And by the way, some of that happened to us. So as we mentioned, before we think some of our retention issues last year may have been related to the same factor of people kind of just out looking for new solutions as a result of what I would call an event, which is a significant event called ACA. So I think all three things are a factor. We really wish we could put our finger on exactly how much each one is accountable. But unfortunately, we can't. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. Thanks so much for the insights. It's helpful. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good Morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to follow-up on the prior question. On the new bookings weakness you're seeing and specifically the revision to guidance. Obviously, going from flat to down 5% for the full year. I think you had talked the last quarter about seeing confidence in improving bookings rates as you head through the end of the year. I guess, maybe you could talk anecdotally about what changed from three months ago to today in terms of specific client conversations you're having, is it simply the regulatory environment, uncertainty, seizing things up in terms of purchasing decisions? And then if you got any color on what clients are telling you about what they have to see to get more confidence to book? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah. I think that a couple of comments and maybe Jan can add in terms of his observations. We've obviously been meeting frequently with our sales leaders, and I've been going around sales meetings trying to get to put my finger on the pulse. And it doesn't appear that it's the economy, because we have very robust and strong results in our downmarket. Our PEO is still doing well. Our MNC business had a great quarter. A lot of the channels that we sell through small business like our Insurance Services products and our Retirement Services products are also doing quite well. So it's really not an across-the-board weakness. It does appear to be concentrated in places where we had the ACA phenomenon, if you will. And then how much of it is related to just the grow-over itself versus uncertainty about the political environment, and the fact that the people maybe are sitting and waiting. We do have some information around our pipeline, which is not the same as bookings. So bookings are bookings, and we are very clear about how we count revenues. And I think Jan just went through the math. But we do have pipeline reports like any sales force would have pipeline reports. And in our midmarket and our upmarket, we feel pretty good like we did last quarter about our pipeline. So if we say we feel pretty good and the sales are not materializing, that can only lead to only one conclusion, which is the decision-making is getting elongated or slowing. And we can't quite put our finger on why, but that's exactly the math is showing versus our pipeline right now. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think the only thing, Jim, just keep in mind our new guidance is down 5% to 7%, is our expected new business bookings guidance and I think Carlos captured it. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Understand. And then maybe as a follow-up. Can you maybe just talk about the regulatory environment changes and what impact that could have on the PEO business? And specifically, what's your confidence level in that PEO business kind of sustaining double-digit growth for the foreseeable future? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Good question. Actually, let me finish also. I think you mentioned about like tone in the sales force. And one of the kind of surprising things for me at least is the tone in the sales force is still very positive. Like, we've done some things to try to \"encourage people not to throw in the towel\" because this is another factor that I have to worry about, right, that we are close to our end of our fiscal year, and the way our incentive systems work, there's a big incentive when you're exceeding plan to over exceed it. And, likewise, there's a bit of an incentive to throw in the towel, if you will, if you're having a bad year. So we've done some things to try to \u2013 and that may be why the sales forces still remains upbeat, or maybe because they think these issues are transitory. It's very, again, hard to put a scientific answer on it. But it feels positive in terms of the tone in the sales force. On the question about PEO and the regulatory environment, I think I mentioned multiple times also in the PEO over the last couple of years that it felt like we were getting some tailwind as a result of ACA, if for no other reason because it was creating conversation opportunities, right. Because people are looking for a solution and they're looking at maybe different alternatives and someone is able to talk to them about the PEO, and I think it's compelling value proposition they're able to close the business. So I would put the PEO in the same category that we were watching, if you will. It's not quite the same in the sense that many of the clients in the PEO are not necessarily buying only ACA. And we're not rushing to make a decision of that magnitude only because of ACA. So I think there's a subtle but important difference. So I'm not convinced and we certainly aren't seeing it in the numbers yet that the PEO will have the same kind of difficulties, if you will, growing over. But it's definitely a more difficult sales environment for the PEO. But having said that, just again we've said this multiple times that the PEO has grown double-digits for, I think, its 17 years now. And so it's just a very compelling value proposition. And if, for example, there are changes in the regulatory landscape, some parts of our business may be affected like our direct ACA product, if the entire thing gets repealed and the whole thing goes away, that would not be good news for that part of the business. But, as we know now from what we're hearing of what's growing through Congress, there's not going to be a complete repeal. There's going to be some kind of new framework. Those types of new frameworks are always good for the PEO because they intend to be more state-based regulation, which is what the PEO is really good at and what small companies are not very good at in having to deal with. And so I think that I would remain generally optimistic and positive \u2013 more optimistic and more positive about the PEO. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from James Berkley from Barclays. Your line is open. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just first, just wanted to start off, I know you just touched on this a little bit, but a little more color would be helpful. I mean, I understand why businesses are holding off with regards to ACA solutions, just given the uncertainties that you mentioned around healthcare in the U.S. as a whole. But at the end of the day, the law is the law, right. So kind of like at what point, if reform keeps being delayed, do you think employers will start to demand the solutions you're offering around ACA and just make other buying decisions in general that they may have been holding off because of the uncertainty? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: We were hoping that that would happen two weeks ago or three weeks ago when President said that he was done with it and that we're moving on to tax reform. And unfortunately, that was not \u2013 it appears not to have been the case. So I think we're watching the same news you're watching. We do have obviously some access to and some information that we get from people in Washington about what's happening on the Hill and the regulation and so forth. But we have kind of similar information to what everyone else has. And these things always, when you're in the middle of them, feel like your feet are in cement. And that's how it feels like to us right now. It's very frustrating but these things pass. We will look back a year or two from now and there will either be the existing ACA or some other version or some more complicated state regime or complex regulatory framework at the state level. And we'll hopefully be looking back and seeing this as yet another opportunity for ADP to shine and to help our clients. But right now, it is what it is, and it doesn't feel great. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And then just to follow up, when you think about the slide that you guys put out, just your long-term growth driver, the 7% to 9% that you think of the longer term and I think you have like a 14% to 15% new business bookings and 7% to 8% reduction from client losses. Just how does that math change given the bookings guidance that you're seeing right now? And I know 2018 is a little early, but just any color you can give us on how to think about how that 7% to 9% growth might be impacted for fiscal 2018? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah. Our longer-term expectations for organic growth is 7% to 9%, as you correctly quoted. And it's driven by growth of new business bookings in the range of 8% to 10% growth. And it always was meant to cover multiple year type of cycle elongated and it was not a commitment obviously, as you see realistically \u2013 not a commitment to perform every single fiscal year. So we are not updating our long-term growth outlook at this point in time. But, clearly, our new business bookings have fallen a little bit behind, but relative to a three- or four-year cycle of new business bookings, we still feel good about our growth opportunities. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Danyal Hussain from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Thanks. I just want to understand the bookings a little bit more. So a two-part question, part math, part more subjective. So the math is just to get the full-year guidance. Seems like you're implying potentially further deterioration in the fourth quarter, unless maybe the weighting from the third quarter is disproportionate, so maybe some clarification there. And then the second part of that is maybe you can just talk about the cadence exiting the selling season and into April? Carlos, you already talked a little bit about hoping to see some change as of two weeks ago but not seeing it but maybe just a little bit more color. Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah. I think you're right that the third quarter is disproportionate. So we have a lot of \u2013 disproportionate number of dollar sales in the third quarter compared to the entire year. And that's just the way the seasonality has always worked. So the fourth quarter would not be materially different in terms of the momentum or this kind of the 5% to 7% down range. It's in that ballpark. So there is really no real news I think there. I think the cadence in terms of the exit for the \u2013 the one thing that we're grappling with is, obviously, we have the realities, right, of the political environment and we're hoping that there will be resolution here relatively soon. Our fiscal year, obviously, starts on July 1. We're hoping to have some kind of \u2013 we thought two, three weeks ago, we had clarity. So we're hoping that we get that behind us and we get some clarity, because we have lots of other products. We have lots of other parts of our business that are performing well. And we just want to get on with it, right, and be able to continue to sell the other suite of products that we have available both in the midmarket and also in the upmarket. So I think, as I mentioned before, it feels like exiting the year, our pipelines are robust. It feels like the tone and the confidence in the sales force is high. But the results are the results. And I think Jan and I live in a world of reality, not in the world of make-believe. And so we're being cautious and careful, but it's hard not to be optimistic because the economy is picking up it feels like. The labor markets are tightening. And we have some very compelling value propositions in that kind of environment where employers now are going to be \"engaging\" in a war for talent again, which we haven't seen. We forget that 10 years ago there was real issue in terms of finding people. And we benefited back then from that kind of environment in terms of our HCM solutions, and we're hoping that we're entering a period here where all of our solutions, the entire suite becomes very compelling as clients become focused on attracting people and holding onto the people that they have. And we see all kinds of metrics in our own numbers and in the government data around higher voluntary turnover, higher wage growth, lots of signals that the labor markets are tightening. And I think our value propositions are very compelling in that kind of environment. So we just want to get this uncertainty and these delays and this slow decision-making behind us so that we can get on to the business. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: And maybe just... Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: ...a little comment to this on the outlook, which Carlos described correctly kind of roughly in line with fourth quarter and the full-year guidance. But we'll also continue to put our dollars where our statements are and the investments into the sales force, the incentives that we're bringing out to get the sales force ready, and the hiring and preparing for growth in the next year are actually fully underway and have actually to some degree impacted our third quarter and fourth quarter results because we believe we have that opportunity going forward. So we're preparing for growth in the future. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. And then just a question on retention. I just wanted to clarify. So it sounded like some of the higher attrition was in the upmarket and was partly related to migration. But at the same time, you're taking a more measured pace with your migration relative to what you do with Workforce Now. So just trying to square that and see maybe where any surprises came versus expectations? Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Maybe one is connected to the other and maybe not. Because I think the reality is that the variability and I think we're very sensitive now obviously to retention for all the right reasons because we went through a really difficult last year, but we've had variability in our retention forever at ADP because it's a different metric than our other metrics and it can be volatile. And as an example, in the upmarket, you can have one or two large clients that can actually move that number \u2013 one or two clients in the upmarket that can move the number for the upmarket and for ADP. And you saw a little bit of that in the first quarter where we lost that large government contract and the business that we ended up selling or were in the process of selling that had a material impact on our overall retention for the first quarter. So this wasn't one large client like that, but it was a handful of clients. And so our upmarket business is a little less than 20% of our overall revenue, so just to kind of put things in context and it's 2,000 to 3,000 clients. And a couple, literally, three, four client losses in a particular quarter can really move the number. So I was just trying to help kind of frame the discussion because at least for now I'm not ready to conceive that we have a permanent \u2013 we don't talk about forward guidance on retention, but this is a third quarter issue for now. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Your line is open. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. All right. One more on the topic of the day, retention. So the upmarket dynamic you're describing, I guess, does feel like it's a little bit new. Is there a change in the competitive landscape in the upmarket? Or is there anything you can identify that triggered I guess this handful of clients this quarter? Or is it just somewhat anomalous? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: It's a good question. And I think that you'd be generally I think right that despite the fact that we do have volatility across quarters, we have generally not paid a lot of attention to it because over the course of kind of rolling 12 months or even in terms of years, calendar years or even fiscal years, our retention in the upmarket has been pretty stable. I mean it's a sticky business. It doesn't change a whole lot. So I'd say this quarter was \u2013 I'd say it's fair that it's a little bit anomalous. And I think the answer to your other part of question; we don't see it as being related to any change in the competitive environment. Now, as always, in two to three years or in two to three quarters, I may be singing a different tune, but we have a lot of data around the reasons for the losses, what platform the losses were on, were they new technology, old technology, and what types of product the client had. And I think when we put all that information together, which Jan and I, obviously, spent a lot of time anticipating this being one of the topics of the day, we've spent a lot of time on this issue and looked at the names of the clients, who they are, what platforms they were on, and we don't see any change in the competitive environment. I think we've said before that there isn't any one competitor that causes us a majority of our losses, and likewise there isn't any one competitor where we take the majority of our business from. It's spread out all over the landscape and it remains that way. For some of our competitors that might be different because of their size where they may have a heavy concentration of taking clients from one particular company. In our case, that is not the case. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: And maybe a tiny bit of further detail, Lisa, is when we look at our competitive position against this multitude of competitors in the quarter, some competitive positions have improved and some have not. And that is a fairly typical thing we see each of these competitors evolving quarter-by-quarter up and down. So when we say the general competitive dynamic we feel has not changed, it's rooted in this analysis, and we see in some cases we have improved and some cases we have not. So it's a mixed bag obviously, but we believe it hasn't changed. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah. I think I didn't maybe answer directly your question about how does this square with our upgrade or migrations strategy. And I think the things really are somewhat connected in maybe an odd way that we think that because we know what clients we lost and what platforms they were on that it makes it even more compelling for us to move our clients onto our newer technologies. On the other hand, we know that these movements are complex and that the clients need to help us and they need to be involved, they need to cooperate. And so finding the right clients in the right place at the right time is just different than it was in the midmarket and in the down market. But it think it heightens our confidence that it's the right thing to do over time. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And then I guess the follow-up, as we've been living with you through the Workforce Now migrations in the midmarket, I know you've consistently said that the retention levels are higher on the migrated clients and so there's sort of this nirvana we are going to get to when the migrations are done where retention should naturally go back up. Are we though now facing a more protracted period in the upmarket kind of going to the same thing? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: So I think the nirvana, it does from what Jan and I were looking at just over the last couple of days, their retention rates on our current version Workforce Now strategic platform are extremely high, and we're very happy with them and we have a lot of volume on it already. So that feels like it worked out the way we had hoped and we had anticipated. And with now the down-market on our new strategic platform with potential rates that frankly have improved dramatically over the last couple years and with our Workforce Now migrations being completed by the end of this calendar year and with 20% of our base remaining in the upmarket, we're feeling good about where we are. But the answer to your question is, yes, we have a protracted migration effort in the upmarket. It's the right thing to do. We're going to do it, and we're going to do it as well as we can and as quickly as we can without causing damage and disruption to our clients. But we're in a very different position from where we were four or five years ago when we had 10% of our clients on our strategic platforms that are version-less in cloud where there is no further migration and there is no further disruption. So it's a very, very different place and it hasn't felt good getting here but it feels pretty good now. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Maybe quickly just on a more positive note. I know you've had the reporting and benchmarking modules out in the market now at least for a few months. How are they doing? How is the uptake? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: It's going well. Again, that's another one back to the discussion about what's happening with the labor markets and the economy in general. Those are products that are useful no matter what, but in the kind of environment that we're entering into like helping people make sure that they're paying people the right amounts, that they know where their turnover is in comparison to benchmarks, that type of information is very, very useful to an HR leader or to a CEO in making good people decisions on a go-forward basis. So that's another example of something that the conversations for the last two or three years were about ACA. I think the conversations for the next two or three years are going to be about what's happening with your workforce, what's the turnover rate, how are you paying people. And I think these benchmark and analytics tools are going to facilitate those discussions, and hopefully, those sales because those are conversation openers or starters in order to convince clients to come to our product suite, which is I think unique in a sense that it has these data and analytics benchmarks. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Terrific. Thank you. Thanks for all the transparency as usual. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you so much. A few times you mentioned the uncertainty and you thought it might have dissipated a few weeks ago when we had a little bit more clarity on ACA. Is the client uncertainty and the elongated decision-making you think it's solely related to ACA issues? Are there just other things going on in the current environment that clients are worried about? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Again, I'll just say one more time. It's impossible for us. We don't really have like a chart that kind of follows that. So this is really more on intuition, and I'll let Jan comment as well. But it's not just ACA that's creating uncertainty. I think the administration has asked the Labor Department to review the overtime rules, for example, that were about to be issued. I think there were pay equity rules that were coming out around EEOC reporting that are now under review as well. The fiduciary rule, which was intended to go through the \u2013 which would have affected our Retirement Services business has also been put under review. And so I think there are pockets of uncertainty in addition to ACA. And some of them happened to be related to our core business, which is HCM. And so if you're selling, for example, an ERP suite, some of that uncertainty may not really affect that decision-making. But if we were involved in a sales process where you had a large hourly workforce and many of them \u2013 sorry, a large salaried workforce because of the new rules was going to now be hourly and those hours needed to be tracked and you needed to be in compliance with the FLSA, that sales cycle has probably been elongated as a client stops and goes back to focusing on whatever they were focusing on before that trigger event. So I think there are a few other things that are probably not helpful, but again, it's hard for us to put a specific measure on each one of them. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. I understand and I appreciate the color. And then just one, I guess, numbers or model-related question. When do we anniversary the bump in bookings from all the ACA-driven business? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Well, next fiscal year, we are clearly half \u2013 still a little bit of grow-over but not that material. So next year should be a clean year relative to the ACA-related grow-over. Just a further clarification, we have tried to illustrate this a few times. With the ACA core module that we have sold came off an incremental fuller bundled sales that particularly included benefit administration module. So the impact of the Affordable Care Act have been broader than the direct impact of the ACA-related sales, which makes it a little bit harder to predict. And as a consequence, our clients (54:35) typically provides ADP-wide about 50% of our incremental new business bookings, however, come from selling more to existing clients. And that dynamic has now changed because we have fuller bundles now in particular in the midmarket. And so we started to transition to drive new logo growth in the midmarket and those channels have to readjust a little bit as a consequence of the ACA surge that has driven a more complete bundle in particular in the midmarket. So that transition is still present obviously next year, but we feel that we have great strategies in place to replace basically that up-sell strategy with a more aggressive new logo sales. And as we have clarified, it is a disappointing quarter, but despite our down guidance for new business booking sale, it will still be our second highest sales year ever for ADP. So keep that in mind. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Perfect. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital. Your line is open. Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, guys. This is actually Jay Hanna on for Gary today. Kind of going off that last comment, going forward, given the struggles with the client retention this quarter and the now expected decline in bookings, should we expect an even greater spend on sales force additions going forward? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Well, it's funny you should mention that, because I think Jan I think did address and I'll let him if he wants to give more detail, which we probably don't because we're not giving FY 2018 guidance yet. But we're definitely not taking our foot off of the accelerator. So we obviously could change our minds a quarter or two from now, but our position right now is I think we mentioned it in Jan's comments, we're maintaining our investments in service, implementation, et cetera. And in some cases we've actually accelerated or increased some of our investments. And I think in the sales organization is a place where I would say we've added expense. And the irony is that the underlying sales expense gets helped by weaker sales because our commissions are lower and so forth, but there's a lot of things that go into that sales expense bucket, including head count cost and commissions. And so it's safe to say that our commission expense and our variable expense is helping us from a cost standpoint. But instead of taking that all to the bottom line, we have chosen to invest because, again, we believe our story which is that nothing fundamentally has changed in the economy, which is typically what really affects ADP, which by the way affects us less than most because of the nature of our business model. But if we saw a recession coming or a slowdown coming, we would have to start thinking hard about our expense levels. And that's not where we are right now. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Just a quick reminder, as one of the advantages of ADP is that we serve such a broad range of segments and markets in the U.S. and globally and multinational, and so as we had our challenges in the mid and upmarket, we continue to perform tremendously in the down-market, in the PEO, multinational. So there's a broad range of products that are gaining share and really driving success. So obviously, in that balance, our investments into sales signal our confidence for ultimate success in distribution. Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. That makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon from R.W. Baird. Your line is open. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. Couple of product-related questions. With regards to the higher ratings in terms of the G2 for Workforce Now, at what point do you start pivoting from migration of existing clients to proactively selling Workforce Now to clients that aren't currently utilizing ADP at all in the midmarket? That's the first question. And then secondly, can you tell us where we are with regards to Vantage in terms of the optimization of that solution, and when you would feel really good about pushing that? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: So I think the answer on the Workforce Now question is, about three or four months ago because I think Jan just alluded to that that we've kind of tilted our focus now more towards new logo growth and new share from kind of the traditional approach of \u2013 doesn't mean we won't take additional modules and incremental business. But this is a fairly significant change from a sales force mentality standpoint where we were for several years focused on upgrades and on incremental sales of other modules to the existing client base as we upgraded them combined with selling something called ACA, which to some extent was a significant tailwind. So we're moving into a different environment. Luckily, we have other tailwinds like great products like you just mentioned with Workforce Now, and we can see, for example, our client satisfaction scores improving. We can see our client retention scores on our strategic platform being very, very high, higher than we've had overall for the midmarket historically. So there's a lot of positive signs that we want to step on the accelerator and proactively sell our solution just as you mentioned. And I think we kind of got that religion, if you will, I don't know four to six months ago. And we've been retooling, right, in terms of \u2013 I think Jan alluded to channels. I think if we're going to go after incremental new logos, not just add-on business that requires channel partnerships. And I think there's a lot of effort underway to build the same kind of success we have in our downmarket now with our midmarket channel partners. And so, the answer is, we're on that and we believe that, that will get traction over time. On the question about Vantage, Vantage continues to do quite well. And there, again, our satisfaction scores, for implementation have improved dramatically over the last several quarters as we invested in that process of the implementation process. I think we have like almost 350 live clients, versus I think we were at 220 at the beginning of the fiscal year. We have I think 500 sold, so we have a decent pipeline that needs to be implemented. And I don't mean pipeline. Those are actually signed contracts, 500 signed contracts. And so, we feel pretty good about our Vantage platform. I think it compares really well and competes very well with our upmarket competitors. But you all see the same thing we see. It's a very competitive environment in the upmarket and there are a lot of solutions. But we like what we have, and I think we're competing very effectively. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. And next a quick follow-up. With regards to the dual service platforms, do you still think that by the end of calendar 2018 you'll have completed that transition to the new service platforms? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah. You're never complete on operations, Mark, but the majority of our work is actually this fiscal year and next fiscal year. So in next fiscal year I'd still anticipate some dual ops. We haven't determined what that will be specifically, but there is still transitioning happening, but the vast majority relative to those three new locations and the two existing ones should be completed in 2018. But our service strategy is obviously organic and evolving and we're going to continue to drive improvements, but 2018 is a big year still for us. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys. Just two quick clarifications. Just on the retention. Do we know where these clients are going? Are they bringing it in-house, the service? Just curious. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah. The sources of our business and the sources of our losses is something that we track. And both have very similar dynamics. It's a fragmented and there's no clear trend to it, and so they go to a variety of different targets. Some in the ERP space, some to our traditional competitors, some to other solutions, so it is a wide range. Some is driven by their M&A activity, moving to on (1:03:41). So the loss reasons and their targets is varied as the sources of our businesses are varied and as a consequence we feel the competitive dynamic has not fundamentally changed as we observe it. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: And we did look at that. I happened to look at it last night. I asked for a little more detail in terms of our upmarket losses and unfortunately I didn't compare the same \"top losses\" to last year third quarter top losses, but when we looked at this year's third quarter losses, there were a couple that went back in-house. That we're using, for example, our COS solution, which is our BPO solution upmarket, and I guess they decided to go back and rebuild internal capabilities and use their internal technology. But I think Jan described it well, because I mean we sound elusive when we give you that answer, but it's really all over the board. And maybe that's because of our size because again, and just to continue to emphasize some of our competitors would have a different story just because of the differences potentially in terms of size. But in our case, it would almost be easier if we had one specific place or one specific reason, but it's not that way, neither in the upmarket nor for ADP overall. So there's no discernible pattern across \u2013 even in the place where we had the concentration of losses this quarter, we can't see discernible pattern. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: No, that's helpful. And then, the other clarification is just on an environment where you guys are, let's say, seeing slower revenue growth. Can you still get operating leverage and increase operating margins? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Well, yes. And that's fully our intention. So obviously, it's much easier to get operating leverage and margin improvement when you're growing revenues faster. But we are who we are. So we know ourselves very well, and we know that we're a $12 billion-plus company. And so we are happy with 7% to 9% revenue growth. And it's easier to get margin when you're at 9%. Like when you back out disposition that we had with that AdvancedMD business, we were almost getting close to 10% revenue growth at one point. Now we're excluding, again, the dispositions this year, we're probably closer to 7% or so in terms of our revenue growth. And the reality is that it's harder. But we're a very disciplined company. And so, for example, you can see our head count growth for our own internal resources slowing down slightly, despite the fact that we're still investing in our sales organization, because we have lower volumes. And so we know that, we get that. We've been doing this for 68 years. And so we will adjust appropriately because we still want to deliver great service. Retention is the most important thing for us. And so we don't want to cut too much or we're not cut because this is a matter of slowing the growth of expense, not cutting expense. But we are slowing the growth of expense in certain areas as our revenue growth slows in order to be able to continue to drive operating efficiencies because we believe there's still opportunity for that. We have a lot of process improvement initiatives underway across the company because we believe that the complexity that we have historically had, the number of platforms, all the things that we've been telling you about that we're trying to simplify, all those things are margin opportunity for us without affecting our associates and without affecting our clients. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Helpful. Thanks so much for the details. Operator : Thank you. And we have time for one final question. And our last question will come from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Your line is open. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Hi, Carlos. Hi, Jan. I guess the first question is, if bookings growth recovers or as bookings growth recovers either because of easier comps or other factors, what is the relationship, the impact on the margins I would imagine would be negative. If you can talk about the specific quantification of that relationship, that would be helpful. And the other modeling question I have is with regards to the go forward tax rate? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: So I wish there was an easy answer to the question about margin and sales because back to, again, we want to be intellectually honest here. We had two or three years of very robust plus 12% sales growth, new business bookings growth and we drove margin improvement. So we clearly have the capability to drive margin. And some of that depends on the timing of when the investments and the expense go in. So as I think we've mentioned, we've I would say invested a little bit ahead of 2018 from a sales standpoint. If we had strong new bookings growth next year, there might be some incremental variable cost around commissions and so forth. But I'm not saying it doesn't matter. It clearly matters. The math is very straightforward. But we have a lot of levers in our business and we make choices every day in order to balance our objectives, right? And one of our objectives continues to be margin improvement. But we also have an objective around growth. We have an objective around capital return. And we balance all of those things and I think try to do the right thing for our shareholders and our stakeholders. So I guess, the short answer is, we have the ability, I think, to drive margin when new bookings recover. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: And on the tax rate, Ashwin, this quarter was onetime unanticipated strong outcome relative to our tax strategies of the R&D credits. So this quarter is not a regular quarter, it was a onetime effect and so we're going to be returning to our \u2013 well, that said, we're not giving guidance for next year. But it's certainly not going to be at the level that you saw in the third quarter. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. And the third question I have for you Carlos and Jan is really, as you reflect back on how this year sort of transpired and you think about the operating plan for next year, which you're in the process of doing. How does that affect, how you go about doing the operating plan, the fact that you're considering and so on? If you can kind of walk through the process, what changes, what doesn't change? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think that, frankly, the things that we look at and the things we do, many of them, we learn every day. Like, Jan and I are learning every year and every day in our current jobs, and we've learned from our predecessors for many years, and I think this company has a lot of deep experience and knowledge about economic cycles and about how we manage our sales force, et cetera. So we, frankly, would make changes around the edges. But we're very consistent in terms of the way we approach things. And so one of our objectives for 2018 is this is the kind of experience and environment that would lead you to be overly conservative. And we want to be very careful about that. And that's why we haven't \"slashed\" expenses or sales investment because we just don't see the sign that that is the appropriate move right now. And so in a strange way, part of our challenge for 2018 will be to not allow ourselves to become overly conservative because we want to take advantage of the market opportunity that we have in front of us. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: The tenets translate into what you have heard. Our belief that our core strategic platforms need to be funded and need to be innovative. So we have a belief in our core capability to develop those products. And we continue as we had in a prior question, our belief that the service alignment initiative is fundamentally positive for our business outlook going forward. So we need to continue to drive the execution of those core strategic initiatives, and we continue to believe that our sales force has opportunity to execute and we will be funding those appropriately. So those may be the core tenets kind of really executing around the strategy that we have laid out for the last few years, also on 2018 is a fair assumption to make. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you guys. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Just a couple of quick closing remarks. Obviously, we acknowledge we had a very challenging quarter. But I think you can also tell from our tone that we still have a lot of confidence in our business model and in our continued ability, not just to grow our business but also to drive operational efficiencies. You probably also can tell that, in particular, I'm hopeful and optimistic that the continuing labor markets are going to continue to drive value in our HCM solutions for the market. So I think the economic cycle and the tightened labor markets I'm hoping will help us as we try to reengage our sales growth and our revenue growth. And I think as Jan just mentioned, we're going to continue to make the investments in our innovation and simplification efforts because we believe they're yielding the right kinds of results. We're going to continue to align our service model, so the strategic alignment initiative I think continues to move forward and I think is on plan. And as you also heard, we're going to continue to expand our distribution channels because we've shown a historical ability to create opportunities and use our distribution channel to grow the company, which is ultimately our objective. And so with that, I thank you for joining the call and I thank you for your interest in ADP. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

LLC Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC Operator : Good morning. My name is Kevin, I'll be your conference operator. At this time, I'd like to welcome, everyone, to ADP's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded, and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there'll be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now turn the conference over to Mr. Christian Greyenbuhl, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Christian Greyenbuhl - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. This is Christian Greyenbuhl, ADP's Vice President, Investor Relations, and I'm here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call and webcast. Before we begin, you may have noticed in the slide presentation, posted on our website, that we included the detail of our client funds available for sale portfolios as of June 30, 2017, which shows the embedded book yields of the portfolio by year of maturity. This chart is in the appendix of the presentation, and is provided for your information. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures is included in the earnings release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. This quarter you may have also noticed that we've included more expansive disclosure regarding our definition of organic revenue, so as to exclude the impacts of foreign currency translation and M&A activity. We believe this best reflects the underlying operating performance of our business, and I encourage you to review our earnings release for additional details. I'd also like to remind everyone that today's call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, as such, involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current excitations. Now, let me turn the call over to Carlos. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you, Christian, and thank you all for joining our call this morning. We appreciate your interest in ADP. This morning, we reported our fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2017 results, with revenue growth up 6%, both for the quarter and the year. Revenue for the year was up 7% on an organic basis, benefiting from a solid 6% client growth and from the continued strong performance of our downmarket, PEO, and multinational solutions. In line with expectations, our new business bookings declined 7% this quarter and 5% for the year. While we are disappointed with this year's overall bookings performance, it's important to look at the underlying dynamics. The clients were concentrated in our mid- and upmarkets and the challenges were due in large part to growing over the strong fiscal 2016 sales of solutions that assist our clients in complying with the Affordable Care Act. Despite these challenges, the sales opportunities within the mid and upmarkets continue to demonstrates a solid environment with positive growth prospects. We continue to be very pleased with the momentum and performance of our downmarket and the PEO, both of which continue to demonstrate the value of a broad-based portfolio of solutions. During fiscal 2017, we increased our head count investments in our sales organization to better position us for growth during fiscal 2018 and beyond. As the tightening labor market creates additional demand for human capital management solutions, we expect these investments to help us further grow due to the effects of the regulatory uncertainty that prevail within the mid and upmarket since the November U.S. Election. Accordingly, as we return to a more normalized growth trend, we expect fiscal 2018 new business bookings to grow 5% to 7%, gradually expanding back to pre-ACA growth levels as we progress through the year. We remain confident in the strength of our distribution capabilities and the competitiveness of our products. And in turn, our ability to execute on our pipeline of market opportunities. Client satisfaction continues to improve, retention remains high on our strategic platforms, and we are pleased with our progress in upgrading our clients to our latest cloud-based solutions. This quarter, we are also pleased to see retention improvements across all our market segments with retention improving by 60 basis points and finishing ahead of our expectations. Our full-year retention was down 50 basis points to 90%, which also includes a 20 basis point impact from the loss of the Office of Personnel Management contract in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Please note that this contract was part of the CHSA business that we subsequently disposed-off during the second quarter of fiscal 2017. I would also like to remind you that the loss is contributing to our annual decline in retention remain concentrated on our legacy platforms in the mid- and upmarkets. Our excellent retention performance in the downmarket and improving performance in the midmarket reinforces our core belief that our focused and steady upgrade strategy is the right thing to do for our clients as well as for ADP in the long-term. Core to our philosophy and value proposition is our commitment to developing innovative ways to enhance not only our clients, product, and service experience but also that of our strategic partners. Last quarter, we mentioned the introduction of ADP Accountant Connect, where we are leveraging the scale of our strong 510,000-plus client base downmarket to create a compelling value \u2013 to create compelling value for our referral partners. This unique solution provides our accountant channel partners with a unified view of payroll, including reporting and tax information for our shared clients. It also enables our accountant partners to deepen their relationship with our shared clients by giving them greater insight into payroll data and helps them plan and manage labor costs more efficiently. Adoption of Accountant Connect has been strong. We now have more than 8,000 accounting firms using the platform, which is making life easier for the accountants and the clients we share. This is helping to deepen relationships with an important source of referral business, while increasing our value proposition for RUN clients. We are incredibly pleased with the adoption of the platform by our accountant partners, and we're also especially pleased that we recently received the Accounting and Tax Technology Innovation Award (sic) [Tax & Accounting Technology Innovation Award] (6:39) by CPA Practice Advisor. ADP's success is rooted in part on our ability to help clients manage through regulatory change. This is especially true from our PEO, ADP TotalSource, which served more than 485,000 average worksite employees this quarter. The value proposition of the PEO gets stronger as the complexities of managing the workforce increase and expectations of employees evolve. Great PEOs are built to adapt to these dynamics and help clients navigate these changes. And we believe that our PEO is the clear market leader in both the breadth and depth of service. In June, Internal Revenue Service named ADP TotalSource one of the first certified professional employer organizations. We're proud to be among the first PEOs to receive this important new designation, which certify that ADP adheres to the highest standards. Becoming a certified PEO, further distinguishes ADP and is a another example of the lengths to which we are willing to go to ensure our clients know they're working with a trusted partner. As our clients' needs have grown globally, so have our capabilities and our reach. And today, we are supporting clients in more than 110 countries around the world. Success in the HCM market on a global scale is not easy to achieve, given the complexities of doing business in many different countries and the local knowledge and understanding that is required to support clients. Constellation Research, a strategic advisory firm, recently recognized this by naming ADP GlobalView HCM to the Constellation ShortList for Human Capital Management Suites for the second consecutive quarter. Constellation evaluated more than 25 global HCM platforms to determine the top five best-of-breed vendors. In naming ADP to the ShortList, Constellation recognized us for the depth of our global compliance expertise. Noting that behind the global view product were local compliance experts on the ground monitoring and interpreting legislative changes that affect the more than 14 million clients we support outside the U.S. This global reach remains a truly differentiating capability for ADP and continues to meaningfully contribute to our growth. In closing, we're pleased with our ability to response to the challenges we faced in fiscal 2017. This year, we began to see signs that are improving service metrics and our progress on client upgrades are helping to drive improvements and retention. At the same time, we are beginning to see some signs of stabilization in our mid- and upmarkets new business bookings performance as we lap the difficult fiscal 2016 compares and the fiscal 2017 effects of regulatory uncertainty following the U.S. Election. These dynamics, together with a continued strong performance of our multinational solutions, downmarket offerings, and the PEO, give us confidence heading into fiscal 2018. ADP is built for the long haul. Consistent with our long-term objectives, and consistent with conversations we've had with shareholders, we'll continue to leverage the strength of our business model and our proven ability to execute by making smart investments that enhance our service capabilities, our sales force and deliver best-in-class cloud solutions. We believe these efforts will continue to drive sustained long-term success for our clients, our associates and our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jan, who'll review our fiscal 2017 results in more detail and share our fiscal 2018 outlook. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you very much, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, we took a restructuring charge of about $49 million related to our Service Alignment Initiative, which brings our total related charges for fiscal year 2017 to $90 million, which were in line with our estimates for the year. Certain non-GAAP measures in my commentary to follow, excludes the impact of these charges, as well as certain other one-time items recognized earlier in the fiscal year and in fiscal year 2016. As Carlos mentioned, fiscal year 2017 was a challenging year for ADP, as we worked to further stabilize retention and build upon the strong new business bookings from fiscal year 2016. As a result, for fiscal year 2017 ADP revenues grew 6% on a reported basis to $12.4 billion, 7% organic. Pre-tax earnings from continuing operations before income taxes grew at 13% on a reported and constant dollar basis. Net earnings grew 16% to $1.7 billion on a reported and constant dollar basis. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or adjusted EBIT, grew 8%, or 7% on a constant dollar basis to $2.4 billion, despite about one percentage points of combined pressure from our second quarter business disposition and our fiscal year 2017 acquisitions. Adjusted EBIT margin increased about 30 basis points compared to the 19.5% in fiscal year 2016. And included about 20 basis points of pressure from dual operations cost related to our Service Alignment Initiative. We will always focus on making the right investments for ADP's long-term success. And our results this year reflect the impact of our investments to continuously innovate to transform service and to further expand our sales force. With these investments, I'm pleased with the margin expansion that we have achieved this fiscal year, despite the impact to revenue growth from our fiscal year 2016 retention pressure and our lower-than-expected new business bookings this year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13% to $3.70, reflecting a lower effective tax rate and the benefit of fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. In addition to delivering this solid operating performance, we have paid about $1 billion in dividend and returned about $1.3 billion through share repurchases for fiscal year 2017, having now fully returned the proceeds from our fiscal year 2016 debt offering. In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 4% on a reported basis for the year and included one percentage point of combined pressure from the sale of our CHSA and COBRA businesses and the impacts from foreign currency. As Carlos discussed, client revenue retention increased 60 basis points in the fourth quarter. For the year, retention declined about 50 basis points to 90%. Our same-store pays per control in the U.S. grew 2.4% for the fiscal year. Average client fund balances grew 3% compared to a year ago. Balances increased due to a combination of wage inflation and growth in our pays per control, which were partially offset by the impact of client losses and pressure from lower state unemployment insurance collections, resulting from the improving employment environment. Outside of North America, our solutions have continued to perform well, largely helped by the continued strong performance of our multinational solutions, which serve businesses of all sizes. Employer Services margin increased about 20 basis points for the fiscal year. The main drivers of our margin performance this year include operational efficiencies on lower revenue growth, offset by continued investments into products and service, including dual operations related to our Service Alignment Initiative. We are pleased with the continued strong performance of our PEO, which grew to serve more than 485,000 average worksite employees during the quarter and posted revenue growth of 13% for the year. You may have noticed the acceleration in our PEO revenue growth in the fourth quarter, which trended at 16%. The PEO benefited this quarter from higher growth and pass-throughs as we began to lap the easier compare in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. PEO margins continued to expand through operational efficiencies, which helped drive approximately 80 basis points of margin expansion in the year, which was slightly below our guidance of about 100 basis points. Our growth in zero margin pass-throughs was the main contributor to our stronger-than-expected revenue performance in the fourth quarter and the resulting full year (15:40) effect means that we experienced the opposite impact on our margin expansion. However, we remain pleased that the PEO continues to demonstrate solid growth as evidenced by the strong double-digit growth in worksite employees. Overall, I'm also pleased with our performance for fiscal year 2017 following our midmarket retention difficulties in fiscal year 2016 and a lower-than-expected new business bookings performance in our mid and up-markets in fiscal year 2017, which together yielded a slowing in our overall organic revenue growth this year. Despite this top line pressure, we maintained our focus on the long-term strategy and expanded margins, while we continue to make these important additional investments. With that, I will now take you through our expectations for fiscal year 2018. As Carlos mentioned, for fiscal year 2018, we're expecting new business bookings growth of 5% to 7% from the $1.65 billion sold in fiscal year 2017. While we have some improving signs \u2013 have seen some improving signs in the fourth quarter, we expect this growth to accelerate to a more normalized pre-ACA level as we progress throughout the year. As a result of the above and the impact from our bookings in the latter part of fiscal year 2017, we anticipate total revenue growth of 5% to 6% for fiscal year 2018 and expect to be at the lower end of this range during the first half of the year. This forecast assumes 2% to 3% revenue growth in our Employer Services segment and growth and pays per control of 2.5%. Revenue growth in the PEO is expected to be 11% to 13%. ADP's adjusted EBIT margin is expected to contract 25 basis points to 50 basis points from the 19.8% in fiscal year 2017. And I will now walk you through a few key factors regarding this guidance. While we expect our revenue growth to be stronger in the second half of fiscal year 2018, with growth at the lower end of the range in the first half, we believe that it remains important for us to maintain our planned strategic investments into innovation, service and sales as we grow through the short-term pressure. Accordingly, we expect to see continued margin pressure in fiscal year 2018 with our margin declines concentrated in the first half of the year. Despite this pressure, we expect to continue to drive at further operating efficiencies as we leverage our platform strategy to reduce expenditures on non-strategic products and leverage the scale of our operations through the productivity improvements. We are now approximately halfway through our Service Alignment Initiative. And for fiscal year 2018, we anticipate a slight incremental pressure to margins from dual operations as compared to the 20 basis points of pressure that we experienced in fiscal year 2017. Overall, we believe that making these investments will help solidify our long-term success. On a segment level, we anticipate margin contraction in the Employer Services sector and segment of 50 basis points to 75 basis points; for the PEO, we expect continued operating efficiencies offset by pressure from our pass-through revenue growth to drive margin expansion of 25 basis points to 50 basis points. We're expecting growth in client funds interest revenue to increase about $40 million to $50 million in fiscal year 2018. The total impact from the client funds extended investment strategy is expected to be up about $30 million to $40 million. The details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. As a reminder, this year's tax rate included an incremental $0.04 per share software development related tax benefit and a $0.07 per share benefit related to the adoption of a new stock-based compensation accounting guidance. Because these two items are not expected to recur, we estimate our adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 to be 33.0%. As such, adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 2% to 4% compared with the $3.70 in fiscal year 2017. So with that, I will turn the call back over to the operator to take your questions. Operator : We will take our first question from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC : Good morning. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Good morning. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Good morning. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC : Could you talk a bit about customer buying intentions? What is the sales force seeing downmarket, midmarket, and up-market in terms of sales cycles and demand patterns as you look out to FY 2018? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Well, I think as we've said in our comments, the midmarket, the PEO, multinational have all been quite strong. And really, especially, in a downmarket, as we mentioned, has been really no impact from this grow-over issue with ACA. So, we've, I think, had what I would consider to be the best results in several years in that space in the downmarket. In the midmarket, obviously, we had a very significant grow-over, given the strong sales for ACA products in 2016. But as we've kind of checked in with the sales force throughout the year, and frankly, continue to make investments to keep their heads in the game, we've maintained our turnover at almost exactly the same rate it was in the prior year, which is a very encouraging sign because, obviously, it was a very tight labor market. So, my worry was given our performance, we might lose some of our sales force. But I think it's a sign of, I think, optimism on the part of the sales force that there is really no issue with the economy or with our products or competitively or with pricing that it's really just unfortunately a mathematical issue that got aggravated by some of this uncertainty that came out of Washington, which really stop people from buying not only \u2013 or slowed the sales of ACA to a much lower level than we had planned, but I think just created some kind of short-term uncertainty after November. I think in the upmarket, we did, I think, feel after November that there was some elongation in terms of decision-making, which is a little more logical because you have relatively sophisticated buyers there. And I think some were probably waiting to see what would happen with the regulatory environment, given that there was talk of repealing ACA and repealing a number of other regulations within weeks, as we all know that hasn't happened. And so, I think gradually things feel like they've gotten a little bit better and things have loosened up a bit. But as we know from what's going on in Washington yesterday and today, I think in that space in particular, I think there's still, I think some probably wait and see on the part of buyers. At least in our experience with our products. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC : Understood. And then just a quick follow-up on the Service Alignment Initiative. What is the incremental spending on that in FY 2018? Basically, the delta between the adjusted and the diluted EPS guidance? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: So, our non-GAAP charges for the year, I think, is expected to be $30 million to $35 million. And it's really a very small margin impact incremental to the 20 basis points that we had in 2017. So, I think a few basis points more, but more or less between $20 million and $25 million if I give you a range, I think I would expect pressure so the incremental is very little. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yes. And I think if I you stick to like looking at 'our adjusted results,' then you shouldn't even worry about it for next year because the dual ops incremental expenses is minimal. So, there's really nothing to worry about. By the way, those \u2013 that will be two years of \u2013 so we had a step up of \u2013 and it was a 20 basis point impact of dual ops this year. Next year, it's about the same level of expense and then it should fall off, obviously, in the following year. But the restructuring costs themselves for the Strategic Alignment Initiative are non-GAAP. And so you shouldn't have to, I think, worry too much about trying to figure out the analysis there. Because should not be \u2013 should not enter into the picture. Other than, obviously, we're incredibly excited about what is going to be the outcome of the Strategic Alignment Initiative down the road. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC : Have you seen an impact from it yet? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Well, I think that it's obviously very early. We're about halfway through in terms of the hiring plans. So I would say that, I think, we joke around that I think this is the easy part. So putting buildings up and hiring people, we definitely accomplished it. And we're right on track in terms of \u2013 and on schedule in terms of our objectives. We feel like we've gotten some great people. We've got great engagements. Obviously, they're in the process of being trained. So, I think all systems, so far, we haven't seen anything to indicate that our expectations that we had of the project are going to be anything other than what we expected. So we're very excited that we've been able to kind of stay on track. But I think it's a little early to really declare victory. But we're very optimistic as this, obviously, is going to create a much enhanced experience for our clients, given that we're putting teams in large locations that are, what we call intact, and are able to deliver services across multiple modules rather than just in silos. Not to mention, obviously, the consolidation effect of having large groups of associates, which we've seen already in two locations that we've had for several years, El Paso and Augusta, creates very, very high engagement, better NPS scores, better client experience, and better associate experience as well. So, we're very excited. It's obviously a big investment. And fortunately, it's on track as of now. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC : Thank you. I appreciate all the helpful detail. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. Thank you. Just looking at the slides here. I was hoping, maybe on \u2013 just to help unpack the margin investments you're making in the ES again? Is there a way to maybe break it up to think how much of the margin investment is in, say, sales investments and product whatnot versus investments in retention, or if there's any investments in pricing? For example, is there a way to simplify it that way? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yes. It's \u2013 let me start at the enterprise level to give you a little insight about the margin dynamics that we are experiencing compared to \u2013 between 2018 and 2017. And then, I can give you some pointers on the segment level. So, the pass-throughs are the most important factor that are very transparent, really. And if you decompose the margins for 2017, you will identify that our overall EBIT margin expansion was about 30 basis points. But we faced about 120 basis points of pressure on our overall margins just from the fast growth of our pass-throughs. And so, that's a starting point of our business dynamic between the two segments. And so to offset that, we had basically about operational scale and contributions to margins of approximately 100 basis points to 120 basis points, if you like. So \u2013 and that's kind of the dynamic. Sales was flat to margins this year and so operational scale is basically contributing about net 30 basis points to all margin expansion, offset by the pressure from the pass-throughs. And next year, we kind of anticipate a similar momentum relative to the pass-through development. So, we're starting already with more than 100 basis points of pressure. And what you now will see is, well, slightly down and, largely what will happen is slowing of the revenue growth will make the operational scale a little bit harder to achieve because we kind of set our cost base to grow, so to speak, in to a growing revenue base and right-sized for our service levels throughout the fiscal year. So, we have a little bit of a higher cost base in the first half of the year where you basically see operations, basically, being flat to margin contribution, and then in the second half, the kind of return to a more normalized level. So net-net, the margin pressure from the pass-throughs is only partially offset by the operational scale to the operations and sales throughout, for all intents and purposes, is kind of more or less flattish contribution to margins this year. I hope that's helpful. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: And I think the last thing you mentioned, which should also, I think, address is, is it related to pricing, and the answer is not. For the last several years, we've been trying to gradually bring down our, 'price increase'. And we've done that again this year. But it's $5 million to $10 million. It's not a big deal on the 'overall gross and net price increase that we passed through to our clients. So \u2013 but there's no change in pricing in terms of new business or the competitive environment or anything to that effect. I think it's really related to the factors that we're seeing that Jan was talking about in terms of some of the revenue growth issues. The good news for us is that the scale really starts to pick up again for us in the second half. So if you look at the way this issue has worked with the grow over, part of the confusion might be related to the fact that our fiscal year is in the middle of \u2013 obviously, ends in the middle of the year, and the impacts are really calendar-year impacts. And so, if you go back and you look at quarterly numbers, you will see that we had two strong quarters the first half of this fiscal year, and then now we just had two relatively weak quarters because of the grow over issues. So we will have another two-week quarters because of the grow over issue at the beginning of fiscal 2018, and then our plans are that our sales return to near pre-ACA levels in the second half, as well as our revenue growth begins to once again gradually accelerate. Now, of course, that means that we have to hit our plans in retention and new business bookings, but that's the way math does work. Everything we've been telling you, I think, is accurate about the impacts of the grow over of this ACA issue, which were significant. We've mentioned that the business itself is about $175 million in revenue, which means that we sold about $175 million. And so that affected our new business bookings, which is what's causing the grow over from new business bookings. And likewise, the $175 million in revenue, even though it didn't come all in one year, a lot of it did come in January of 2016, which means that from a revenue standpoint, you also have, call it, a point or so of incremental growth that you've picked up from ACA. And then, obviously, now, from a comparison standpoint, you lose a point. And that's right about how the math works because on an organic basis, we're at about 7% growth this year, and we were at about 8% last year. And so our hope is that once we get past the next couple of quarters, that we get back here to business as usual. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. So that's all great. That's really helpful. So just a quick follow-on, given everything you guys just said there, so as we can move into the second half, and I appreciate you guys are spending through this cycle for the long term, is it fair to say, then, you'll be through the transition and you should get closer maybe going into fiscal 2019 to your longer-term targets on top-line and margin expansions or anything else that could derail you from doing that? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: That's exactly the plan, and obviously recessions or... Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Sure. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: ...conflicts with Korea, but that's exactly what the plan is. And I think that the second half of this fiscal year starts to pave a path for us to be there, based on our \u2013 obviously we don't guide and we don't give you quarterly guidance, but we have that in front of us here, and we're looking at it. That is exactly the picture we're seeing. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you for the update. Operator : Our next question comes from Rich Eskelsen with Wells Fargo. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to follow-up on Tien-Tsin's question and hone in on the sales impact. I believe you said that was sort of flattish on the margins. But can you talk about what impact the declining new business bookings had on any incentive compensation? Was that offset by new sales hiring, and how are you building that into the plan for next year as you assume it goes back to growth? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah, delighted to give you a little bit more background. As Carlos mentioned in his comments throughout this more difficult year on new business bookings in 2017, we continue to make, in particular, new sales hires. So our quota carrier count increased actually this fiscal year by 8%, which is about twice the rate of what we would typically 9% \u2013 Christian tells me it's 9%. So, it's higher than our typical rate. As you know, we try to grow our sales \u2013 new business bookings by approximately half through quota carrier growth and from half through productivity and new product additions. And so this year we overinvested, if you like, in head count. And so part of the lack of spend on commissions for product sales were offset by a) incremental incentives to our sales force to retain our existing sales force and investments into new salespeople that are now hired and gaining productivity and part of the lift that we're seeing on sales productivity next year is driven by these new fourth quarter carriers becoming more productive and making a contribution. So when you think about sales costs as part of our overall margin development throughout the year, it looks like that we have \u2013 that is about flat. It's about flat to margins, for all intents and purposes, for precision that we know. And in comparison, we had a little bit more margin pressure for sales in 2017 in the second half versus the first half because the first half in 2017 started kind of good. So you'll see this balancing out, basically, in 2018 where it is for all intents and purposes throughout the year, more or less flat, slightly improving towards the back end of the year. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. That's very helpful. Just following up also, earlier you talked several times about the strength in international and multinational. Maybe if you can go into a little more of the dynamics on what you're seeing there? Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think our strength in particular \u2013 and we think we've talked about this for several years, is really our multinational solutions really do appear to be highly differentiated. And again, multinationals is both very, very large companies with very large populations of employees, but we also have multinational solutions for a company that may be headquartered somewhere in Europe and has 20 employees in four countries in Europe. So we really go all the way from very, very large Fortune 100 \u2013 or world Fortune 100 companies all the way to what I would call local multinationals, if you will, or regional multinationals. And so it's a highly differentiated product. We've had good sales growth over multiple years, double-digit revenue growth, generating great margins because now we've got scale, and the business is \u2013 I would just call it humming along. Our international business, I think, has gotten better on, what I would call, a relative basis, because it's been a difficult backdrop in Europe, which is our largest international business. We also have a business in APAC and Latin America, but our largest concentration other than Canada in North America is in Europe. And so that European business on a relative basis, slight improvement in the underlying pays per control. It looks like GDP is starting to pick up a little bit there. Sales, a little bit better this year than we have for the last several years, but I wouldn't say that that business is at the same performance level as the multinational business. We hope it will be at some point in the near future, but the international business, good, solid performance and really good margin performance as well where that business \u2013 10, 15 years ago, my predecessor, we struggled for years to really get that business to perform as well as the rest of ADP from a margin and \"retention standpoint,\" and I think we're kind of there now. So we've got good leadership and I think the business is performing very well. We're very happy with our international and multinational business. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And international is about 20% of the total? How big is the multinational piece? Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Multinational \u2013 sorry. I think in total is about $500 million, Jan? Is that... Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: It's a little bit more than $500 million, approaching $600 million, actually. And Carlos's description is correct. That's very good and strong, solid double-digit growth for many years. In Europe, a little bit lower, more mature business, but both components really showing nice margin expansion and good business characteristics. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: And then what we call international. So the multinational is $500 million. For rounding purposes, call international $1 billion. And then Canada, another $400 million. So that's how you get to approximately 20%. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with Bernstein. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning, guys. Can you give an update on the migrations? Are you still on track to finish the midmarket migrations to Workforce Now by the end of the year? And where are you sort of seeing client interest or demand in shifting to Vantage in the upmarket? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: We are on track on the migrations. I think we did about a couple thousand this quarter, probably 2,500 to 3,000 the previous quarter to that. So we're kind of in the same general ballpark, which just as a reminder is much lower than it was at its peak when we were in the middle of ACA, because we had a lot of accelerated migrations in order to get clients on the right platforms to be able to do ACA compliance for them. And then with the benefit of hindsight, that was an issue for us that caused some of our retention challenges. But fortunately that's all behind us now. And now we're back to what we were doing all along for several years, which is migrating clients at the right pace, with the right attention and the right what we call now white-glove service. We have I think it's 5,000 to 6,000 clients left in the midmarket? I'm checking for... Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Approximately. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: About 5,000 to 6,000 clients left. And so you can see that at the pace that we're on now, we have a shot at getting it done by yearend. We might have, whatever, 500 clients, 1,000 clients left at yearend, that doesn't obviously concern me because we would have done, I think, 60,000 clients. So if we have to \u2013 and again, the way our business works is everything has to stop in the middle of November because of yearend. And everything starts again in February. In other words, the company just becomes focused on getting through the yearend process. So it could be that we have 500 to 1,000. But it's obviously helping us on a number of fronts because our retention on our strategic platform is much higher than our legacy platform. So as the number of clients gets smaller and smaller, we get a mathematical lift, if you will, just because of the mix issue. So I think it's \u2013 I would say that it's probably not something that will be an enormous amount of focus for all of you going forward, but it is an incredible accomplishment. Because I was talking to the person who runs R&D for that organization about a week ago, and he named all the platforms that we had 10 years ago when he first went to that business. And we're down to one platform here, and we're close \u2013 almost across the finish line. So the power that that business is going to have now, the focus \u2013 and to focus on the competition and to focus on execution and NPS scores and retention is going to be, I think, equal to what we've done in the downmarket on RUN, and that gets me excited. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Terrific. And then just as a quick follow-up, can you articulate what macroeconomic outlook is embedded in FY 2018 guidance and kind of what the latest temperature check on the U.S. macro environment? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: As you can see and kind of read from our pays per control metrics and deduct from our money \u2013 from our client fund interest rate forecast, which are the most explicit components in our forecast, we anticipate that the economy is going to continue on a steady path that we have seen in the last 12 months, which, I think, is probably the best bet that we have today. The labor market is in full employment, and we have seen \u2013 and we are shifting our focus on delivering HCM solutions to our clients that help our clients to attract and retain their employees in a better way. So there's a slight shift in focus as you have full employment, the fight for talent and recruiting becomes more important, and we're prepared to offer great solutions for this. And on the interest rate environment, obviously the forward curves predict rate increases, another rate increase towards the end of the year by the Fed, and the rates are creeping up over time for a modest contribution on the client fund balances. So I think it's a steady state in a slight rate increasing environment going forward that we have baked into our plan. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Terrific. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel Financial. David Michael Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, thank you. I just wanted to ask a quick question about the competitive environment and just some rough math, if we assume that basically two-thirds of our ES business is mid- and upmarket in those segments, and the aggregate churn is about 5% annually, is it correct to assume that business as usual, if you will, for ADP creates about $300 million of opportunity, if you will, for your competitors each year? And then second, are there any other internal statistics that you can share with us that would give us some insight into how you've been faring competitively, let's say, over the last 12 to 18 months? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Sure. I think your math is probably pretty close, directionally close. And that's been obviously why we keep focusing so hard on our service experience and our retention rates because obviously every $10 million that we keep is $10 million less for the competition. So that's why you hear us being so keenly focused on retention over the last several quarters. In terms of competitive information, we've said before that we really don't have any one competitor who takes more than 10% of our business, if you will. So there's really not \u2013 and that's been consistent for a long, long time. So there is a lot of competition. So we have a lot of competitors, who operate in multiple segment s. The competitors in the downmarket are different from the midmarket. The midmarket is different from the upmarket. Some of them bleed across some of those segments. But in general, we have competitors that tend to be more focused on a particular part of the market than us, which are broadly focused. I think that gives us some advantages, which we leverage in terms of products and service capabilities, et cetera. But at the end of the day, we are very large, and we obviously are the target for a lot of competition. In terms of specifics, we do look very deeply on a quarterly basis at win/losses both head-to-head and sales and also in the book. In other words, clients that we lose to a particular competitor and clients we take away from a particular competitor. In addition to looking at the head-to-head competition from a sales standpoint. And again, this quarter, unfortunately, it's the same story as other quarters, which is there's no discernible pattern other than there were a couple of competitors in particular that we were able to reverse the tide on, which I'm incredibly proud of because as you point out, we have \u2013 there's a few of our competitors that aren't even at the size that you mentioned of $300 million. And obviously we are several billion. So whenever you can take the net balance of trade and improve it, it's a big accomplishment, and it shows competitive strength in the products, and it shows execution ability in the sales force as well as on the implementation and on the service side. So there's some glimmers of hope in the last couple of quarters that when we put our minds to it, we can push back, and I think that having clients all-in-one platform, having ACA behind us, there's a number of factors that I think that give me confidence that that focus will be even more heightened on a going-forward basis. And that we'll be able to hopefully make that $300 million, $250 million or $200 million and hopefully slow down some of our competitors. David Michael Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. That's very helpful. Thank you for that. And just one other question, and I know you don't like to give \u2013 or you don't give quarterly guidance, but given the margin and revenue headwinds that we talked about that you're going to have in the first half are somewhat uncharacteristic, can you give us any incremental insight into how we should think about the quarterly EPS cadence for the year versus historical patterns? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah. We would like to try to help there. And I'll be careful and I'll let Jan do the closing here. Because of the way our business works, it's a recurring revenue business, and events tend to take place at calendar year ends like they did with ACA. So the first two quarters of this fiscal year should not look that different from the first two quarters of this fiscal year from a revenue growth standpoint. If our sales forecasts and our retention forecasts hold true, by the second half of this fiscal year, there will be gradual improvement on the revenue growth. Likewise, when you look at margins \u2013 now, clearly, as Jan said, we've been 'adjusting' our expense base to a lower revenue. We just didn't want to do it too quickly because we're trying to focus on retention as well, and we mentioned that we're making investments in sales. But there should be some gradual relief of pressure on the margin in the first half of this fiscal year compared to the second half of last fiscal year. But even more, 'relief' and improvement in the second half. And I would call it significant improvement and relief in the second half. And again, that's all mathematical, and it all works that way, and I think that's probably \u2013 I said probably more than I should say, and I'll let Jan... Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: No, I think a few more pointers. I think the risky part in building the quarterly model is to go and compare to the quarters one to one, first quarter versus first quarter because of this grow over issue that we had in the first half of fiscal year 2017. So we grew our earnings in fiscal year \u2013 first half of the fiscal year between 20% and 26% because of this revenue boost that we received. I think the sequential analysis is more meaningful because the cost base that we have in our business in the fourth quarter is likely to be smoothly continuing on. And so you make your revenue assumption, and then it's going to be very steadily improving with kind of acceleration towards the end of the year. That will be kind of my guidance. And I'll look at this, it really develops very smoothly. And then maybe one point is important, I tried to isolate it in my remarks, but part of the earnings pressure, of course, is that the tax rate is jumping up back to 33%. And I kind of want to remind everybody that the $0.07 benefit that we had for the accounting of the equity-based employer compensation is not contemplated in the 33%, but likely we're going to have option exercises. It's very hard to forecast those benefits. So we had $0.07 last year. And that's about 2% of earnings growth, roughly. So you can make your own assumptions on the tax rate also. So the 33% is the number that is our forecast excluding that. And we anticipate some benefit, but it's very hard because share price and employee behavior will dictate it. But you may be more bold in the forecast. David Michael Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Very helpful, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from James Berkley with Barclays. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks for the time, guys. It's nice to see bookings turning around in fiscal 2018. Can you just touch on the percentage of new bookings coming from the PEO side versus the Employer Services side historically? And how that compares to what you're seeing now, or providing the bookings growth rates for each as well, if possible? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Well, it's like the mechanics of revenue growth indicate to you obviously that sales growth is driving those revenue growth numbers. So we have strong growth, strong double-digit revenue growth in the PEO. We have strong double-digit revenue growth in multinationals. Those businesses we had great performance in the SBS space. Those businesses obviously have disproportionate growth in our new business bookings. And so reverse engineering tells you if we're anticipate kind of about the same type of revenue growth in the PEO that the growth of our new business bookings goes in parallel. So we have a slight \u2013 those are the faster growing business, also on the business bookings side that we see. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: And I think in terms of the relative size of the PEO bookings, I don't know that we don't really give that guidance, but I don't think there's anything wrong with giving you a range of the sales dollars for TotalSource are somewhere around \u2013 call it 20% to 25% \u2013 20-ish%, if you will, of the total bookings, somewhere in that range, maybe a little bit higher than that. And again, with good growth, obviously that's driving the top line revenue growth. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I'd just like to remind everybody, the new business bookings for our PEO business at the 20% to 25%, 22%, whatever, does exclude the pass-throughs. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: That's right. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: So you have to make them comparable. So that's why we really don't like to give out these details because it's going to be more confusing than not. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah. I shouldn't have done that because Jan is right. If you look the sales at the gross level including the pass-throughs, they would be probably, almost as much as our total bookings, because other PEOs probably may report their sales or the new business bookings that way. But obviously we, for the sake of comparability and to make sure that it looks like other ADP business as we do exclude the pass-throughs in the way we count it. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. If you could just discuss what you think is driving the record-high retention you're seeing in the downmarket and provide any additional comments on how the midmarket is tracking, and where you think that could go after the work you've done in the downmarket, and given what you're doing in midmarket now? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: So I'll add that we had record retention in a couple of other places as well. So the PEO had record retention. The SBS business in down-market had record retention. We had a couple of other places that had record retention as well. And I think that in most of those cases, the only thing I can put my finger on is execution because they are good businesses, and there's a good backdrop. But for the benefit of hindsight, that's kind of always been true. And I think the one variable seems to be execution. So if we really deliver great products and great service, the clients stay in all of the segments. And so the retention in SBS, for example, now in the downmarket is 3 to 4 percentage points, not basis points, higher than it was five or six years ago and higher than \u2013 and that much higher than we thought we would ever be able to achieve. And again, I think it's getting all the clients on one platform so that you make all your investments and you put all your focus and all your R&D on one platform. You heard what we were doing with things like Accountant Connect. It's very hard to do those things when you have three or four platforms. So having everyone on one platform, going after kind of the friction and the things that create bad service experience and just good execution, all those things, I think you put them together, and it's really created a really great story for us that obviously is translating not only into great retention but great retention in these businesses leads to really great margin performance and really good revenue growth. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: And maybe I'll add the midmarket experience, we have seen improvement in retention in fiscal year 2017 in the midmarket, and it was paralleled by a very significant improvement in our service levels and a meaningful improvement in our client satisfaction scores. So we feel encouraged about the development in the midmarket. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Jim, if your line is muted, could you please unmute the phone line? James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Apologies. Maybe if you can talk a little bit about the bookings outlook and your visibility as you see it throughout the year. I mean, I guess it kind of implies in the back half, you could probably be back to solid maybe even double-digit bookings growth in the March and June quarters. Can you maybe talk about the visibility you have on that, and was that a correct assumption about the numbers there? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: So the visibility that we have is related to the number of salespeople we have and their productivity, what we call annual sales productivity. So we have a lot of data and many years of data around that. And we know that our productivity jumped dramatically when we had ACA sales and obviously came back down when we didn't have that tailwind. But we have ways of getting at the numbers. Having said that, we've said multiple times where it's retention or new business bookings, the amount of visibility we have to that is less than things like revenue next quarter because it's a completely different issue in terms of the recurring revenue, nature of the business makes the revenues, and the margins are somewhat predictable. So new business bookings and retention have less visibility. But we have ways of getting at what we think are the right targets, which I think as you mentioned are much better obviously in the second half. So again, all things being equal, if the economy cooperates and we continue to execute well and the math holds up historically for ADP, we should be able to get to those numbers. And obviously, it doesn't happen in a vacuum. You've got to have great products. You've got to keep sales force turnover down. Those are kind of the controllables that we focus on that, I think we're doing frankly an exceptional job on right now. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think one point of information is remember in the first quarter of 2017, we did sell \u2013 have some ACA sales, this is prior to Election. And we had a pretty good performance actually relative to our expectations in the first quarter. So we still have \u2013 we have no material sales assumptions for the Affordable Care Act this fiscal year, but we still have a little bit of grow over challenge in the first quarter, so that's going to be a little bit more difficult, but then \u2013 Carlos's words hold, of course, the truth. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. And then maybe just a clarification. In terms of the capital allocation strategy, is there any buyback assumption embedded in your fiscal 2018 guidance? I know there was one explicitly called out in fiscal 2017 guidance. Wonder what it was (58:20) for 2018, if any? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: As you are a very correct observer, Jim. So as an exception in fiscal year 2017, we guided for incremental share buybacks, because we wanted to make \u2013 be clear that our intent was to return the proceeds of our debt offering in 2016, which has been completed. So we're now returning to our normal practice, which is we are anticipating to offset equity based dilution for our employer compensation, which is about $400 million or so. And then we should expect \u2013 we're aiming to be back at our long-term model that we have shared. And I think the long-term model includes \u2013 not that we guide to it \u2013 but the long-term model anticipates the return of excess cash to our shareholders of approximately 1% \u2013 resulting into approximately 1% of share count reduction. That will be our long-term model and pending on market conditions, obviously. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, guys. This is actually Jay Hanna on for Gary today. Just a quick question with regard to bookings guidance. You're guiding for 5% to 7% in fiscal 2018, and that's coming off a reduction of 5% last year. So that really only implies flatish to 2% over two years. And on a four-year CAGR, if I'm doing the math right, that implies about 6%, which should remove for most of the ACA-related noise. And this just falls a bit below the 8% to 10% long-term model you've given. So I just was wondering if you had any comments with regard to that? And if maybe we should think about it through a different lens now? Thanks. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think it depends on how you calculate your averages and where you have your starting point. Clearly, our sales guidance for 2018 signals our optimism into our success of our sales force and the competitiveness of our products. And clearly we are anticipating to grow out of that grow-over challenge that we had. And the way I think our guidance words is that we are kind of returning over the year back to our long-term expectations. And as Carlos confirmed in his initial remarks and impressions, we are sticking to our long-term expectation model that we have set in our Investor Days a couple of years ago. Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And then just another quick follow-up. Are you including in guidance any uptick in sales commissions related to the return to growth in bookings for the year? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yes. Our operating model and operating plan fully contemplates the sales cost related to new business bookings. We had a dynamic twofold, as I tried to explain, in 2017, accelerated investments into head count staffing, which kind of elevated our sales costs and distribution costs a little bit and incremental sales incentives to get us through a difficult year. And next year we have distribution costs planned for a more normalized head count growth of approximately 4%. And obviously, we're matching commission expense to our expected sales results. Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Danyal Hussain with Morgan Stanley. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick follow-up on bookings. The fourth quarter came in a bit better than your expectation. Would you attribute more of that to client behavior inflecting more positively or just your investment in sales? And then likewise for fiscal 2018, could you talk maybe about the degree of conservatism in your outlook just in the context of what happened last year? Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think it's really too early to read anything into the fourth quarter sales results. Because as Jan just said, we put in incentives to try to get people over the finish line. We frankly also implored the sales force to \"not give up,\" because we don't want to send the wrong signal to the market or to our competitors. And so there's a lot of moving parts here that I think may have contributed. But it was better than the alternative, so we're happy that we had the finish that we had. But I don't think that there's really anything you can scientifically read into it, other than maybe underneath the surface there's some better environment in terms of the \u2013 because some of the uncertainty \u2013 I mean, at some point people have to get back to business as usual despite what's going on in Washington with regulation and with ACA and so forth. So maybe there's a little bit of that. But we \u2013 can't put my finger on it. I wish I could, but our optimism as to your point about why are we optimistic, it relates back to my previous comments around ADP's historical ability to execute in sales related to having the right head count, having the right products, the right sales support, the right incentives, and the right execution. I think with the right economic backdrop, I think should give me \u2013 and it does \u2013 a high level of confidence and optimism. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And then your biggest competitor called out elevated pricing, competition in the midmarket, did you see any of that, or was it just not material? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: No, we haven't \u2013 good question. So we monitor two components of our pricing. Number one is our discounts versus book pricing in new sales. And we are monitoring our pricing levels and concessions in the base. And both are good indicators of the pricing competition. And we have not seen any material change in both indicators. So we view the pricing environment as unchanged. It is dynamic though. There are ups and downs each quarter in different regions, depending on the competitive action that we take and our competitors take. But if you take the aggregate and you look at the lines, we cannot devise a specific trend to increase pricing pressure or the opposite to that matter. So we feel good about the pricing environment. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks. I know it's late. I'm just curious, shifting gears back down to what's going on in Washington, D.C. Have you heard anything on the discussion in terms of tax reform that either might help or hurt your business? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think other than the realization that we have a high effective tax rate and that we view us of a net beneficiary of any corporate tax reform in all scenarios, we have no further comment, because I think you can better assess the likelihood of success in the tax reform to it. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): So but besides that, I guess, I was more curious in terms of from a client impact or a product impact? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Again, we haven't heard anything in terms of that would change, for example, the way taxes are collected in this country or that would affect our fluid \u2013 I'm not sure exactly maybe where \u2013 if there's something you think or you know that we don't know. And we're happy to hear about it or address it. But we're not aware of anything other than they're trying to reduce the corporate tax rate. And obviously there are some, I guess, preferences and benefits that are going to be taken away in order to do that, but those generally apply to, like, the energy sector, manufacturing sector and other. That's why we have a higher effective tax rate. So in theory there are going to be winners and losers. The people with very low effective tax rate are going to probably get an increase in their effective tax rate. And the people who have a high effective tax rate are going to see a decrease because the statutory corporate tax rate is going to \u2013 not going to \u2013 they're saying they're going to take it down. So whether it's 25% or 20% or 30%, that can only help us. And we don't have any significant tax preferences that we take advantage of that would go the other way. From a client standpoint, we do have a tax credit business. It's relatively small. We haven't heard any talk about \u2013 those are targeted job credit-type taxes that are \u2013 tax breaks that are very popular. So we haven't heard any talk about that, those being repealed. I would say it's very likely that if there's any tax reform, that it would be very positive for ADP. It could be significantly positive. But obviously as Jan said, we have no sense of the likelihood of that. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): It was more the credit-relating aspects that I was referring to. Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : Our last question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Good morning. I know you've talked about pricing and not seeing pricing pressure, but I was wondering on the downmarket, your ability to achieve price increases. Have you seen any change in the marketplace that would \u2013 that changes this dynamic from, let's say, a year ago? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: The downmarket has been and actually performing beautifully and competitive strength that the product has, has translated in a very good price realization. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : And then just the last question, Carlos. I know you've talked about competition and you have not seen much difference in competition. But if you just look at the marketplace as a whole, have you seen anything different in the last 12 months, that being \u2013 you know the competition you anticipated that only stayed on the high end coming down to the midmarket or competition that was just at the midmarket coming down to the low end, or competitors leaving the marketplace? Anything that's changed, in your opinion, in the last 12 months? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Just to clarify, and I don't want to be misquoted as saying not seeing much change in the competition because we have a lot of competition. And it feels like we have more of it than we had three years or five years ago or 10 years. But that probably happens to every CEO. They always think that they have more competition than the previous person. So we have an enormous amount of respect for the market and for the competition because there's a lot of it. And we know that we have to earn our place every day in the marketplace by having competitive products and great service. And whenever we slip or trip, they take advantage. And whenever they slip or trip, we take advantage. And so it's very important for us to stay on top of it. But if you're asking about 12 months specifically, there are definitely competitors who have gone \u2013 who have kind of come down segments or gone up segments. But I think, based on my experience at ADP, nothing different from what's been happening for decades where a competitor decides if they're in the downmarket, that they can go up into the midmarket. And they try it and then maybe three years later, they go back, or sometimes they stay. Likewise, we've always had enterprise-size competitors that are in the upmarket who decide to come downmarket a little bit into the midmarket. Sometimes they stay. Sometimes they go away. So I don't think I've seen anything worth, I guess, reporting. But plenty of that type of stuff that you just mentioned. But I think it's normal competitive actions by competitors. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Thank you very much. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes the Q&A portion for today. I'm pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: We appreciate your time today. As you can see, I think these strategic initiatives that we've laid out over the last several years, I think are beginning to deliver on some of the objectives we have around not just shareholder value but also around delivering world-class solutions to our clients. I'm very proud \u2013 it's year-end, so I think I should say that I'm very proud of the hard work and dedication of our associates who obviously have been able to help us deliver these results, including the improvements in the service experience and improvements in retention this quarter. Obviously, we continue to be excited about the prospects ahead of us. We definitely have challenges in 2018 with a softer bookings performance. And as you can tell, we're incredibly bullish and confident still. Otherwise we wouldn't be making the kinds of investments that we're making. So we believe that these investments, along with our ability to execute, I think, really give us the right formula for sustained, continued success for many years to come. So thanks again for your interest in ADP, and thank you for joining us on the call today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect. And have a wonderful day.",

Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC David Michael Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC Operator : Good morning. My name is Brian, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's First Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Call. Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Christian Greyenbuhl, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Christian Greyenbuhl - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you, Brian, and good morning everyone. This is Christian Greyenbuhl, ADP's Vice President, Investor Relations, and I'm here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our First Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Call and Webcast. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. I also wanted to highlight for you that the quarterly history of revenue and pre-tax earnings for our reportable segments is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website. These schedules have been updated to include the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Before Carlos begins, I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events, and as such involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Now let me turn the call over to Carlos. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you, Christian, and thank you for joining our call this morning. We appreciate your interest in ADP. This morning, we reported our first quarter fiscal 2018 results, with reported and organic revenue up 6% to $3.1 billion. We're pleased with this revenue growth which was above our expectations. Revenue growth in the quarter includes approximately 1 percentage point of pressure from the fiscal 2017 disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses, which were substantially offset by the benefits from foreign currency. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 6% to $0.91 per share and benefited from a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding. Overall, this earnings growth in the quarter exceeded our expectations, and we're very pleased with our solid results, which Jan will walk through in more detail shortly. New business bookings during the first quarter were down 3% compared to the first quarter of 2017. This performance was in line with our expectations as we begin to realize the benefits of our fiscal 2017 head count investments while we continue to manage through the effects of the regulatory uncertainty that has prevailed since last year's U.S. elections. Despite the short-term bookings pressure, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of our down-market businesses and the solid results in our multinational business. As we communicated previously, we continue to expect our bookings growth to gradually expand back to pre-ACA growth levels as we progress through the year. As a result, we continue to anticipate full year fiscal 2018 new business bookings growth of 5% to 7%. On the client retention front, we experienced a 160 basis point improvement during the quarter, which was ahead of our expectations and saw positive growth across all of Employer Services Markets. This performance is due in part to our continued efforts to upgrade clients to strategic cloud platforms as well as the investments we've made to improve the client service experience while also aided by the easier compare from our fiscal 2017 first quarter federal government OPM contract loss. Our client upgrade initiatives continue to progress nicely and now we have more than 83% of our clients on our strategic solutions. We also continue to make good progress on our Service Alignment Initiative where we now have 2,000 associates across our three new scalable service centers and 5,400 associates in total across all five of our strategic service locations, delivering service to clients across the HCM spectrum. I'm proud of these efforts and of our speed to execute, which have enabled us to rationalize our footprint by exiting nine subscale facilities this quarter. This represents a closure of 63% of our total planned exits under this initiative in just over one year. The progress we are making with respect to new platforms and improved service is leading to happier clients and improvement in our NPS scores. It isn't just our own internal metrics that are helping tell the story. Last month, G2 Crowd, a leading business software review platform ranked our Workforce Now solution number one in satisfaction for payroll and HR management suites in their fall mid-market grid report. In analyzing the reviews of actual users of the products, ADP was also named the leader in all five HR software categories : payroll, HR management suites, core HR, performance management and applicant tracking systems. We're excited about the innovations we continue to introduce to the market that are helping clients meet the dynamic needs of an evolving workforce. And it's gratifying to see these investments in HCM innovation continue to be recognized with prominence in the industry. A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to attend the HR Technology Conference in Las Vegas where few of these innovations took center stage. For the third consecutive year at HR Tech, ADP was recognized with an HR Product of the Year Award from Human Resources Executive magazine, this time for our Compass Solution which is designed to boost the leadership and collaboration behaviors of our clients' employees. In addition to this recognition, we scored a second three-peat at the show after our Pay Equity Explore Solution was named one of HR Executive's Awesome New Technologies. Pay Equity Explorer is a powerful tool that combines data science and benchmarking and is built on the biggest data sect in HCM, the ADP Data Cloud. It was developed to help clients uncover insights and identify potential opportunities when it comes to gender or race pay gaps, so they can stay competitive in the war for talent. Innovation is a job that's never done. While we are incredibly excited about the solutions we are delivering in the market today, we are even more excited about the future. In September, we had the opportunity to brief HCM industry analysts on the new products and services coming out of our global product and technology organization. At the event, we previewed our next generation of client-centered innovation including a low code application development platform that enables internal and external development teams to build agile country, segment and client-specific applications, leveraging the latest technology and delivered by the public cloud. We also shared progress on our efforts to deliver next-gen payroll and tax filing engines which will further increase our differentiation in payroll and payments. These engines are designed for multi country localization and will enable us to deliver paid and other services with greater flexibility based not only on the needs of our clients today, but also their evolving future needs as organizations are increasingly comprised of both full-time and contract workers. ADP's unique ability to meet the needs of our clients today while anticipating their needs in the future have been hallmarks of our success over the past 68 years, and will drive our sustained growth in the years ahead. Also before I turn the call over to Jan, I'd like to say a few words on our acquisition of Global Cash Card, which we announced in October. At the core of HCM is ensuring employees are paid accurately, securely and in a timely fashion. This is the DNA of ADP. And with the acquisition of Global Cash Card, we are strengthening and expanding this core capability. For those not familiar, Global Cash Card is a leader in digital payments, including pay cards and other electronic accounts. The digital payment space is an exciting one for the future of payroll. The increasing use of contract workers in the gig economy has driven the demand for these accounts, which can let independent contractors bring their various wages and expenses into a single account, providing the best picture of their financial well being. From the employer's perspective, digital payments can be less expensive, more immediate and a more secure option than other means of payment such as paper checks. With this acquisition, ADP becomes the only HCM provider with a proprietary digital payments processing platform which will be integrated with our aligned pay card solution for a seamless client experience. We are excited about this acquisition and we're pleased to welcome the Global Cash Card team to the ADP family. I'm proud of the efforts of our associates. Our results in the quarter continue to reflect the enduring qualities of ADP, including a culture that is relentlessly focused on delivering a great client experience through best-in-class technology and unparalleled service. Fiscal 2018 is off to a good start, and we look forward to turning over full attention to advancing our strategy and delivering on our commitments to all stakeholders, clients, shareholders and associates alike. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jan for a further review of our first quarter results. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you very much, Carlos, and good morning everyone. In my commentary to follow, I will be referencing non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of certain items in the first fiscal quarter of 2018 as well as a first quarter fiscal 2017 restructuring charge of about $40 million related to our Service Alignment Initiative. A description of these charges and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found in this morning's press release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. As Carlos mentioned, ADP revenues grew 6% in the quarter to $3.1 billion on a reported and organic basis. On a reported basis, net earnings grew 9% or 8% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or adjusted EBIT, declined 3% on a reported and constant dollar basis. Adjusted EBIT margin decreased about 150 basis points compared to 19.8% in last year's first quarter. This decrease was slightly better than our expectations despite additional pressure from growth in our pass-through revenues and a very difficult first quarter fiscal year 2017 compare when we expanded margins by 230 basis points. As a reminder, this strong first quarter fiscal year 2017 margin performance was driven by incremental ACA-related revenues, together with operating efficiencies and lower selling expenses, which now have lapped. During the quarter, we continued our planned investments into innovation, service and distribution while we worked through the short-term pressure from the anticipated lower revenue growth in the first half of fiscal year 2018. As we manage for the pace of our transformation efforts to upgrade our clients and to transform our service experience, we believe these investments will continue to help us deliver against our long-term financial strategic objectives. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 6% to $0.91 and 6% on a constant dollar basis and benefited from a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. Our adjusted effective tax rate was positively impacted by unplanned stock compensation tax benefits, which accounted for approximately 90 basis points of the overall decline in our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter or $0.05 to our adjusted diluted earnings per share. As Carlos mentioned, our new business bookings were down 3% and in line with our expectations for the quarter as we begin to reaccelerate our bookings growth and overcome the remaining additional sales of Affordable Care Act-related modules in the first half of fiscal year 2017. Overall, I'm pleased with our results for the quarter, off to a positive start and we're making good progress as we execute against our strategic initiatives. Now let me take you through our segment results before moving on to our fiscal year 2018 outlook. In our Employer Services segments, revenues grew 2% for the quarter and 3% on an organic basis. Our same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.4% in the first quarter. Average client fund balances grew 6% compared to a year ago, 5% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was driven by additions of net new business and increased wage levels compared to the prior first year's quarter. Outside the U.S., we continued to see solid performance from our international operations with double-digit revenue growth in our multinational businesses. Employer Services margin decreased about 110 basis points in the quarter. This decrease was driven by continued investments into our operations, innovation and distribution. The PEO continues to perform well, growing revenues 14% in the quarter with average worksite employees growing nicely by 10% to 484,000 employees. This revenue growth was primarily driven by the growth in average worksite employees and accelerated growth in healthcare renewal premiums. This accelerated growth and pass-through healthcare premiums was also the primary driver for the 60 basis points decline in PEO margins this quarter. But its impact is expected to abate as the year progresses. And I'm pleased with the performance of both of our segments in this quarter. And as Carlos mentioned, we are off to a good start. Before I discuss our fiscal year 2018 outlook, I wanted to highlight some additional detail regarding the acquisition of Global Cash Card. The results of operations of this business will be included in the Employer Services segment, and I expect it to contribute just under 1 percentage point of growth to our updated revenue guidance. While we anticipate future synergies, we also anticipate some slight pressure to margins this year, largely driven by integration costs. Accordingly, we have factors these operational impacts into our updated fiscal year 2018 outlook. As a reminder, fiscal year 2018 has a mix of factors impacting revenue growth and margin the first half of the year, including the disposal of our CHSA and COBRA businesses in November of fiscal year 2017, the impacts to revenue and margin from the incremental ACA-related revenues during the first half of fiscal year 2017 which now have been fully lapped, and also the impact to revenue growth in fiscal year 2018 from lower retention and lower than anticipated new business bookings in fiscal year 2017. With these items in mind, I will now take a moment to walk through our revised outlook with you. First, as Carlos mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our full year new business bookings guidance of 5% to 7% growth on the $1.65 billion sold in fiscal year 2017. With the acquisition of Global Cash Card and some adjustments to our anticipated impacts from our foreign currency translation, we have updated our consolidated revenue forecast growth to 6% to 8% compared to our prior forecast of 5% to 6%. And Employer Services revenue growth of 4% to 5% compared to our prior forecast of 2% to 3%. Separately, we are reaffirming our PEO revenue guidance of 11% to 13%. We are also now expecting growth in client fund interest revenue to increase $45 million to $55 million compared with our prior forecasted increase of $40 million to $50 million. The total impact from the client funds extended investment strategy is now expected to be up $35 million to $45 million compared to the prior forecast increase of $30 million to $40 million. The details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. Our margin forecast remains unchanged. We continue to anticipate our consolidated adjusted EBIT margin to contract 25 to 50 basis points from 19.8% in fiscal year 2017. And at the segment level, we continue to anticipate margin contraction in Employer Services of 50 to 75 basis points, with PEO margins expected to expand 25 to 50 basis points. We now expect growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share of 5% to 7% compared to our prior forecast of 2% to 4%, aided by about one percentage points from the first quarter stock compensation-related tax benefit. Having fully returned the proceeds of our debt offering to shareholders in fiscal year 2017, this forecast does not contemplate any further share buybacks beyond anticipated dilution related to equity compensation plans. However, it remains our intent to return excess cash to shareholders, subject to market conditions. So with that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. We will take our first question from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the time. Just I guess on the retention front, I'm curious where you're seeing the greatest improvement there. Is it more in the mid-market as you convert to strategic cloud platforms? Any color across the organization? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Well, I think as I mentioned in my comments, I think this quarter, the improvements were really across all of our ES segments. And as we've said in the past many times, retention can be a very volatile metric especially as you get into the up market. But this quarter, we happened to have good news and we're very happy about it. We think that is not just because of volatility but I think because some of the things we've been doing around investments in our service organization. We see our NPS scores coming up and so, we're very pleased with that. I would say that, to your question about the mid-market, we are not finished yet with the migrations of our clients in the mid-market. We have about 2,000 left. We still think that we'll be close to done, if not done, by the end of the calendar year. We may have a couple of stragglers. But we do expect to be substantially done by the end of the year and that does put pressure on our retention because as we've mentioned multiple times, and the same still holds true, there's quite a substantial difference in retention between our strategic platform in mid-market and our legacy platform. So, what you're alluding to, we hope and we expect will happen a couple quarters from now as we get all these migrations and the mid-market behind us. But that would not be one of the reasons why there was improvement in the mid-market as well as in the rest of ES this quarter. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. Thanks for that. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: One additional comment, don't forget that we had a little bit of an easier grow over this quarter. We lapped the loss of a large client that we talked about last, first quarter in the year. So, the improvement was in particular visible in the enterprise space but partially aided by the lapping of that large client loss. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think the impact of that large loss was around 100 basis points last year. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: That's exactly right. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: So, the right way to look at this is about 60 basis point improvement in retention for the quarter. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. You get that back but still a little bit better. Okay, good, good, good. Just my quick follow up just on PEO. The WSE unit growth, up 10%, I think that's a little bit below trend. Anything to read into there in PEO? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Other than that it's getting really big. And we're still pretty happy with 10% unit growth. I don't think anything further to report there, but that's becoming a very large, we're close the 0.5 million worksite employees. That's one of the largest employers in the U.S., if you look at it as, which we do, as an employer even though there are sub-clients. Obviously there's more than 10,000 clients in the PEO, but it's a very large \u2013 the way we treat it for, the way we have our retirement program and the way we have our workers' compensation and benefits, et cetera. We are a co-employer and consider ourselves a co-employer for the purposes of some of the responsibilities around employment. And so technically, I think we're probably in the top five now in terms of size of employers in the U.S. which is becoming a very large base. But we feel pretty happy and pretty satisfied with that kind of growth rate. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: The development is right in line with our expectations and as you saw we are reaffirming our revenue guidance so, going good. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great, thanks for the update. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed. Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning guys. I just wanted to follow up on the comments around the migrations. I think you said 83% of clients have now been migrated to the next-gen platforms. Can you tell us in terms of percentage of revenue where we stand on that? And then any comments around a reasonable new bookings growth range for Q2. Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: So just to make sure we get our language clear here, because we have introduced some new terminologies. So, when we refer to next-gen platforms, so we have our strategic platforms, which are Workforce Now, RUN, Vantage and our Global View multinationals platform. We did start talking and we mentioned it in our introductory comments that we talked to industry analysts in mid-September about our next-generation platforms which we have only a handful of clients on today. So, I just want to make sure I clarified the language there. As we go forward, we'll be more careful about making sure that we pick the right language. So, and I'm sorry, what was the rest of the question? Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just the percentage of revenue then I guess that has migrated to the strategic platforms, because I think you said 83% of clients but percentage of revenue. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: So since we still have a lot of work to do in the up-market where we've really only begun the migrations, I think that's consistent with what we've said before in our publicly released information around the proxy contest. I think we included there about 51% of our revenues being on our strategic platforms that I just mentioned the names of. It's very important to note that when we talk about our strategic platforms, we have a number of areas of our business where there's really no immediate plan to migrate or move clients. So for example, our insurance services, our retirement services, we have some international platforms that we're happy with that we're not planning any movement there. So, we could probably in the future be able to provide some more color around the quote-unquote addressable market. In other words, what part of our client base is really up for migration, if you will, but the right answer, the straight answer is 51%. But we're not aiming to get to 100%, I guess is the. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: And then Jason, if I pick up your question regarding the second quarter, is we're reaffirming just our full year guidance for 5% to 7%. And we don't give quarterly guidance really for our new business bookings nor any other number. And before, Carlos, the 51% of the revenues refers to ES revenues. That's our metric that we offer. Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then it's good to hear about some of the innovation investments that you're doing. Any detail we can get on latest trends with respect to your overall R&D spending, the budgets there in terms of the maintenance R&D piece for some of the legacy platforms and how much of the R&D budget is being directed to new product development, and any shifts in those ratios? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Sure. We disclose a lot of information, again as we've been trying to communicate with shareholders about some of the things we've been doing here over the last five or six years. We've disclosed, I think, some additional information about that. And I think starting off with the fact that we've increased our innovation spend from around $150 million to around $450 million, I think or somewhere thereabouts in that neighborhood, so it's a significant amount of increase in our R&D investment. A large part of that was in the next generation platforms that we just announced recently that we've been working on here in some cases for three to four years. But we've also made big investments in things like our data cloud and things like our mobile solutions and some of the other products and innovations that we actually already have out in the market and are helping us, I think, with our efforts in terms of helping our clients and also helping drive new business bookings and retention and so forth. So, that's a sense of what's happened with the innovation spend. On the maintenance spend, for the sake of I guess government work, it's about flat. So it's increased slightly. But again, in the world of some inflation, the fact that we've held that constant, we see that as a good news story. It was a conscious effort to really shift the mix, if you will, in the balance of our spending to more innovation and less maintenance. A lot of our maintenance spend is focused on platforms that serve tens of millions of employees that get paid, both on our tax engine and our payroll engine. And so as we develop these next generation technologies, when we retire those legacy platforms, which is a ways down the road, then obviously, we would expect actual decreases in maintenance spend. But for the last several years, this has really been a story of increasing the spend and making sure that that spend is focused on innovation while we build out the necessary platforms to move clients to and then reduce the spending on those legacy platforms. We have retired I think it's around 13 legacy platforms. So, it's the first time in a long time at ADP that we've actually retired things. So, it's not like we haven't made any progress, but those were relatively small dollar items in terms of the overall maintenance spend. The really big chunks of spend are on some of our large scaled legacy platforms that service, by the way, very well and are very efficient, very secure and very reliable. And we have no plans to get off of them in the next three to six months or any kind of timeframe like that. So this is a, as we always say, this is an evolutionary process, not an overnight change. Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Well, thanks for all the comments. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mark Marcon with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Two questions. One, any sort of impact at all with regards to all the hurricanes in terms of sales cadence, implementations, anything along those lines? That's the first question. Second question is basically on the PEO and pass-through growth rate. When we think about long-term, would you expect this pass-through growth rate could be in this 14% range if we have underlying say PEO growth in the 10%, or how should we think about that from a longer-term perspective? And then lastly, can you just comment with regards to all the distractions that have been going on over the last few months in terms of how it's impacting the folks out in the field and operations? Thank you. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: So, I'm going to let Jan maybe go through a few of the numbers here. But just quickly on the hurricanes and Jan will give you a sense of impact. Clearly, it had an impact on the business. But I just want to take a moment to also point out that these were massive storms, especially in Houston and in Puerto Rico. We have a decent sized business in Puerto Rico. We obviously have a very large presence in Texas and in Houston specifically. And what our associates and our infrastructure people did to be able to continue our business, not necessarily as usual, but to make sure the business went forward and that we served our clients was nothing short of heroic, including flying airplanes from Tampa when no other planes were flying into Puerto Rico to deliver supplies to our associates but also to deliver payrolls to the businesses that were actually still functioning and still wanting to pay their people so that they would be able to actually have money for, in obviously what was an incredible crisis. So, the fact that you're asking the question, I think shows the strength of ADP that we continued to perform and to deliver business as usual in the face of what was obviously a very, very challenging situation. I think Jan maybe has a little bit of color on the numbers. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah, we experienced some impact on our new business bookings in the quarter, and October could have some bleed over, but as you can see from our reaffirming of our full year guidance on new business bookings, actually we had strong performance that overcame that in the quarter because we performed according to expectations. But there is an impact on our sales force and there could be an impact on our revenues and losses to be quite honest as Puerto Rico is recovering. It will not be material or meaningful to our overall full year performance, but we're sorting that out. So, the business and our clients in Puerto Rico are recovering and we're working with those clients, but not all of them are back online yet. But a large number has and there could be some second quarter impact. But it's not really that material it should impact your calculations. In the long run, I think we expect this to be just back to business. There's a little bit of positive recovery impact that we sometimes experience in the longer sense of a year to 18 months out. But I would assume we're just going to work ourselves through it throughout the year. Relative to your pass-through revenues, the 14% is a little bit on the high side. It has a variety of reasons. If you recall in the first half of last year, we experienced this meaningful margin expansion and the PEO and overall for ADP and it was part, as we illustrated then, by a lower than typical pass-through revenue growth. And so, the factors that impact our pass-through revenue growth are a multitude things that have all played in the last couple of years. The first thing is the participation rate in our PEO and throughout the introduction of the ACA in the last few years, we have seen an increase in employee participation in our PEO. That now has stabilized. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: And health benefits. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Pardon me? And health benefits. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Sure. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: And health benefits. Because, and that participation rate has now stabilized. So, we have seen now a year-over-year relative stable employee participation rate. What then comes is the overall renewal rate, which we're now experiencing is healthcare inflation as you would describe. And that's obviously dependent on the overall market development of medical health inflation. And the last component is the actual employee choice of plans of where we have seen a general trend to higher deductible, consumer health-oriented plans. But as a little bit of an anomaly in this quarter, actually employees opted out of the most skinny solution and diverted a little bit to higher-quality medical plans in our client base, which was a little unusual. So, the overall pass-through growth of 14% is relative to the 10% worksite employee growth is a little bit on the high side I would say in our long-term plans to anticipate. And we published this in our Investor Day pass-through growth of approximately 12% to 14%, Mark. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: And just to point out, there have been times in our history in the PEO where it's been even higher than this. So as Jan said, it really depends on the general health care inflation environment. It's clearly not sustainable from a \u2013 it's not just about our PEO or our own company, but this is why there was healthcare reform to begin with, that you can't have this kind of healthcare inflation for a long period of time, because it just doesn't work from an economy standpoint. It becomes the entire GDP eventually. So, it's safe to say that this is a number that has to, by definition, maybe not over a quarter or two or over one year, but that number has to at some point converge or regress back to the mean. But we have had times where we've had even bigger differential between worksite employee growth and our pass-through revenue growth. And this is probably from a three or four year standpoint, this is probably the highest it's been and it's probably in line with what you're hearing out in the world, right. Which is healthcare inflation's picking up a little bit. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Sure. I was just trying to get towards the longer-term and with a not so subtle reference to some of the discussion around, okay, well how much pass-through. When we think about the net operating profit margin growth that we're going to end up having, how much of an impact is the pass-throughs going to be and what's the right growth rate to factor in? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yes. We'll try to help with that, but again, what we encourage people to do is to look at Employer Services margins and profit growth and the PEO's margins and profit growth. Because what we're focused on is growing EPS and creating value for our shareholders. We're not fixated on a specific margin number even though we realize that the margin number is important to the overall economic model and to actually building a model that works. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: At the end of the day, it's return on invested capital, right? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Right. Exactly, I mean that's ultimately the \u2013 growth in Employer Services and profitability Employer Services and growth in PEO ultimately would drive return on invested capital and that's really the right way to focus on the business. As you know, our PEO business is our most profitable, most successful, best business. So, for us to get overly concerned about mix and what impact that has on the overall margin, I realize it's something we have to address and we have to talk about and help people with their models, but it's really not the right way to focus on the business. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: I really appreciate that. Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: One last thing, because you did mention about the distraction on the \u2013 I just wanted to answer that question because others may have the same question. I think the way I have been, had a lot of investors asking is the same thing, because there's a lot of concern about the distraction of the proxy contest and I would say that it's an extremely high distraction for an extremely small group of people. As you can see from the results of this quarter, it did not distract our associates or our sales force. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Rick Eskelsen with Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to follow-up quickly on Tien-tsin's earlier question on the PEO. Just the question is, you did see the PEO, the ending client's worksite employees down slightly sequentially. That's out of the ordinary for that business. I'm just curious if there's anything onetime going on. Did anything get pulled forward last quarter? Just maybe a little more color on the PEO would be helpful. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah, I think, I wouldn't over interpret. This happens once in a while a little bit and we do have a little bit of fluctuations of how sales come in and how the last quarter ended. And they are like different growth dynamics. So, I noticed it myself but there is nothing out of the ordinary here in the field that I could report. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. That's helpful. Just a quick follow-up. You talked a little bit about the pay equity tool and the data cloud. Just wondering if you could talk more about what you guys are doing on big data. I know that's sort of the long-term thing that I believe Jan has been helping to lead. So, just any more details on the big data and the analytics progress would be helpful. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah, so, as many of you know, we believe it is going to be one of our long-term strategic differentiators or is already today actually. We're selling a core product of data analytics and benchmarks to our core client base and to new clients, which is called Data Cloud that delivers now more than 30 benchmarks and we do sophisticated analytical reporting. And on top of that viewed as a platform we have released a numerous incremental value-add solutions and you see in our emerging strategy. So, the first tool that we have been working on is a tool that allows our employers to manage the risk of employee retention and employee loss and can predict the likelihood of employees leaving the company and allow companies to way better manage performance. And over outcomes, we now released incremental tools on the pay equity explorer, which is a compliance tool that helps you to identify potential misalignment in your compensation relative to diversity measures. And there is the richness of the tool is the exciting part because it will go in a variety of areas towards verticals, towards specific problems to be addressed. And you're going to see a continued innovation coming out and all being fully integrated into our cloud-based platform, which is the benefit that we are now reaping from having one data cloud tool that services all these strategic platforms and then the relative ease of integration of these insights and data analytics into the actual platform. So, it's going to be a very important tool. And this innovation and explore the specific ones that Carlos mentioned really driving the differentiation, leading and client discussions helping us to increase our win rates. And so, it's truly exciting. And it is also revenue carrying. There's been a question around do we charge for this tool and we do charge for Data Cloud. It's a recurring revenue model that clients buy. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. [Operators Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of James Berkley with Barclays. Please proceed. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks guys. Looks like your top line guidance ticked up about 200 basis points, at the high-end of the range, versus an incremental 100 expected improvements coming from Global Cash and FX combined. Is this just a function of rounding or trends surpassing your prior expectations? Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think it's probably, it's both. I think we had, we obviously feel better about what's going on with retention and I think the trends in the business. We got a little bit of help from, even from float income as you mentioned because that actually flows into our top line as well as into our bottom line. But I think you're correct that that just happens to be the way the numbers have fall out as well. So I think it's both things. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: It's Global Cash Card, FX and then a tiny bit of pass-through is in our increased guidance also. So, that may be the third factor if you're looking for a third factor. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up. You guys obviously did your down-market replatforming, doubled margins over a six-year period. The mid-market's almost wrapped up here. Could you just talk about your expectations from margin expansion over like say, another six-year period for the mid-market and then your thoughts on the up-market longer-term as well? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Sure. I think that one of the things we've been as we've been kind of going out talking to folks, making sure that this is an opportunity now to make sure everyone understands that the starting point for margins in terms of the amount of room there is for improvement was larger in the small business market than it is in the mid-market. So we have a successful good business in the mid-market including healthy margins. We do think that based on what we see around retention potential because the real, one of the really important improvement to the small business division was the rise in retention which has a fairly big impact in that business on margins because the amount of business you have to sell, which brings with it sales cost, implementation cost, is less to achieve the same growth objective if you will. And so that was an important part of that picture, if you will, in small business, the improvement in retention. I am hopeful, based on what we're seeing so far, that we are going to experience good improvements in retention in our mid-market as well once we're through migrations all of our clients on one platform. Better retention should have the same impact that it had on SBS in the sense that you have sell that much less business in order to achieve the same growth rate or you can grow faster, like it's either you get the best of both worlds that you can choose which way depending on market conditions you want to move. But the absolute starting point is important as it is always in any situation. And again, we don't give specifics sub segment data if you will. Neither do any of our competitors, I would just point out. But the fact is the margins are higher. They were higher to begin with in mid-market and the replatforming is really about strengthening our competitive position, driving faster growth and hopefully some modest improvement in margins as well because we do expect to get higher retention rates in the mid to long term as we get all of our clients onto one platform. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just maybe wanted to ask a follow-up question on the margin side of things. Can you maybe just give us an update short-term in terms of your investment programs on service realignment and any other new products and how that's kind of contributing to the margin degradation in the next couple quarters. And then as we exit the year and head into 2019, is it reasonable to expect that you would, as you kind of get to the compounded 50 to 75 bps of long-term margin expansion you've guided to, whether we'd see kind of above normalized margin expansion in the back half of this year and heading into 2019? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah, Jim. This year, we have about a similar amount of dual operations costs. I think it's about 20 to 25 basis points of margin pressure for the company in this fiscal year. And as we then complete our service alignment initiative, I think Carlos mentioned, we're making good progress on it. We exited nine locations already in this fiscal year and we are really on track on and on time. We see that those new associates going to be settling in and dual ops is going to disappear and then the next year, fiscal year 2019 and 2020, we did actually provide investors with an idea about the margin expansion which we I think characterized to be around 100 basis points at the enterprise level in our presentations. And there's nothing changed in our view that that, what we would be doing at this point in time. So the dual ops would be dissipating and then I think also elsewhere in that presentation we alluded to the fact that we see then the benefit of the workflow efficiency, wage advantages and so forth that our strategic locations offer and contributing incremental to it, the productivity improvements and cost efficiencies. So I think what we're presenting is kind of the current plan. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah, and think I also want to point out again, I want to say it one more time that clearly some of the pressure we're experiencing is from investments, because we have been investing in our sales force for example. But it's just important to note that some of what's happening in terms of these numbers is still these mathematical grow-overs and comparisons. Because last year, in the first half of the fiscal year, so the last two quarters of the calendar year, we had almost 20% operating income growth, and then in the last two quarters of the fiscal year, first two quarters of the calendar year, because of the ACA grow-over in the comparisons of having lapped the revenues, the revenue comparison, we ended up having the numbers go in the opposite direction. And the two quarters that we're in right now, the quarter that we're just reporting plus the next quarter, are really mirror images of the first two quarters of the calendar year. And then as we've said multiple times in our guidance, our second half of this fiscal year gets back from a margin standpoint, from a growth standpoint, from a bookings standpoint to a more reasonable normalized place, if you will. So unfortunately the way \u2013 you guys know this better than anyone else \u2013 like whenever, whether it's an acquisition or ACA or some other factor, you have to really look beyond that to understand what's really happening beneath the covers. And so we had 12 months of easy comparisons, and then we had 12 months of hard comparisons. And we have, I guess right now, a couple more months before we get through those difficult comparisons. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's helpful context. Thank you. And then maybe a follow-up on the product side, maybe for Carlos. As you think about your enterprise product suite and how you plan to refresh and augment it over time, you referenced the low code application development platform. Can you maybe give us a sense about your conversations with clients in the early stages? What are the elements of this platform that are resonating with them? And do you get a sense that any of the enterprises that may be shopping around are swayed or potentially have changed their mind about switching off of an ADP platform or staying on an ADP platform because of this? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Well we hope, we do for example invite clients on a regular basis to visit our Innovation Center in New York City in Chelsea to kind of get first hand knowledge of some of the things that we're working on. And it's not just about the platform. We have other things that we are working on as well that we share with our clients. So obviously, part of that is an effort to make sure the clients understand our roadmap and so that they stick with us as we get through product development and then eventually a transition to our New York platforms. I think that would be true in each of our business segments, but it's obviously very important in the up-market enterprise space where the client lifecycles are very, very long. So we have very high retention rates in our up-market business. Client stay 15 to 20 years on average. And obviously if they are staying with ADP for that long, that means they've already been through multiple changes in technology with ADP over the years. So this is just another evolution if you will, which makes the products better for them, easier to use, easier to service, easier to upgrade. So these are all, I think, part of leveraging technology, which is one of the central themes that we've had here for the last five or six years. So we're really trying to do what ADP's been doing for many years with a slight change in emphasis, with greater emphasis on product and technology than maybe historically we had had 5, 10, 15 years ago. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of David Grossman with Stifel. Please proceed. David Michael Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. It's been a while since we've been in any favorable rate environment. So could you just help, or just review for us how higher rates flow through to ADP and how much of that perhaps is shared with a client and gets reflected in pricing over time? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: So the second part is a tricky question, because the way it gets shared, if you will, is it makes our company stronger. It allows us to, for example, theoretically, to be more careful with price increases. None of which \u2013 so I guess the answer is, we haven't changed anything. Like it hasn't \u2013 if rates were as you know because of the way our portfolio is laddered, even though we felt multiple years of pressure on the downside, we are getting a little bit of help here on the upside. But there's really, this isn't like an overnight, and I don't mean overnight in the sense of rates. But because of the laddering, there's not that kind of dramatic of a change that we are all of sudden that it's raining money out of the helicopters and we have to figure out what to do with it. But we definitely appreciate it. It's better than it was when it was going in the other direction. So it's all positive. So I think historically, I think it probably make us stronger, more competitive. But we really don't \u2013 there's no pricing mechanism. We didn't raise prices, when interest float income went down and rates went down. And we don't plan on lowering prices when it goes up. I guess to be completely direct. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Can I give of more couple more technical updates, David? There is no, if you ask revenue share of float income with any of our clients, we don't have that business model. It is a negotiated fee price and then some of our products actually declines really, we negotiate with them the value of the float and it reflects in the next contractual relationship we have with our clients. But it is not an explicit revenue share of float income. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: And, Jan, just to add, just to be even more clear, we lost $300 million in float income and that's assuming that the balances have stayed flat, but the balances actually grew from about $15 billion to over $20 billion during that period of time. And I am thinking back to like 2007 and 2008 when we peaked in terms of our float income. And so there's a long way to go to get back to that $300 million and that would not be even adjusting for inflation and for growth. And as Jan just said, we don't have those kinds of arrangements. We didn't increase our prices when that was going on. So we managed to improve our margins and grow our business in the face of that kind of headwind. And so I think it feels fair to us to now enjoy the fruits of a better environment on a go-forward basis would be the way we would look at it. David Michael Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Understood. Thank you for that. And then I just have a follow-up to the last question that was asked about a little bit about the product roadmap for the up-market. Can you give us a better sense of timing of when you, or how you expect to roll out some the new future functionality of what you're working on. At least in your mind, what are the major changes, if you will, that you're making to the new version of the up-market product? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: We never said there's a new version to an up-market product. And so you shouldn't say it either. So what we built was, we built a platform on which we can build apps that could serve a number of different clients. It could be used globally. It could be used in the up-market and frankly someday, can be used in the mid-market. So we're not ready. We shared a lot of information with industry analysts and we're trying to share as much information with all of you without sharing so much information that it creates a competitive problem for us. And so we're not ready to say exactly what we're doing and where we're going. But I can tell you that the benefits are obviously usability, speed to change and speed to development, cost of maintenance, not to mention cost of development. So there are a number of benefits that we will get from our product development efforts. And that's really only talking about the low code development platform. We also have two very large investments in back-office systems. So this is our gross-to-net payroll engine and our tax engine as well. There we expect and the plan is to have that be completely transparent. These engines are back-office engines that are really not visible to the clients. They just, they create outcomes. The front ends are Workforce Now, Vantage, and some of our other front-end products. And so there's really no expected impact assuming that we execute well in the kind of transition, if you will, to a new gross-to-net payroll and also tax engine. The expectation for improvements, though, are fairly significant in the sense that we'll have a lot more flexibility around the things we can do around payments. So we may choose to, we may not necessarily do it, but we'll have the ability to do same-day payments, real-time payments. We'll have a lot more flexibility around speed to make changes, whether they're statutory or competitive changes in our systems. And then the cost of maintenance and the cost of support will go down significantly based on our business cases that we have for these back-office engines. So these are really modernization efforts because those platforms serve us incredibly well today at high scale, high reliability and high security. But we believe based on our business cases that obviously, whether it's two, five, seven years down the road, that new technology can help us leverage those services that we provide in a much more efficient manner. David Michael Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: All right. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO. Please proceed. Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey good morning, it's Henry Chen calling for Jeff. Just a question on the changing guidance for the EPS or adjusted EPS. Could you break out how much of that is the impact of the acquisition and how much is FX if you could? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Well the impact of the acquisition would be zero because it's zero. It's a great business and it's a good-sized revenue business fortunately it's around breakeven is the way we would describe it. So it's not a huge drag on our earnings and it's not a huge help. It has a small drag on margins obviously because at breakeven, and with some reasonable revenues, it doesn't help our margins. But I would say no impact in terms of EPS guidance from acquisitions. And the other, I'm sorry the second part of your question was? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I can give you a little bit on the tax side. Actually, that's a big chunk of it. It's a little less than 2% of that increase comes from tax and that's just the good performance that we had as well as the $0.05 that we'll have in flow-through. Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got it, Okay. And FX? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I don't have anything here. We're looking it up. I don't think it's that meaningful really. Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Okay, got it. And just a second question on bookings growth and how it's tracking for the year. Just curious if you have a sense of what are some of the drivers for the rest of the year, whether it's product or by market for new bookings growth? Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think for bookings growth, what we try to look at is the noise in the system has been pretty significant in the last 24 months because first, we had ACA and then we didn't have ACA. So I have to preface my comments by saying, it hasn't been exactly business as usual. But in typical business as usual for ADP, we would have a head count increase, accompanied by a productivity increase of our sales force, which would lead to our sales result. And so the mechanisms that we would, the buttons that we would push to try to increase or improve our new business bookings would generally be around increasing our head count, or our capacity if you will of sales, because we could also spend money on digital marketing and other tools that make our sales force more efficient. And then what can we do around products to drive the productivity, because some of the productivity is just like in any business, we expect our sales force to do a little bit better each year. But we also try to give them better products and more things to sell so that they can also grow their productivity that way. So one of the things we did last year is, in the face of the challenges we were having, we decided to actually invest in head count. We'd had two or three years where we were able, because of the tailwind of the ACA, to put less into head count because we were getting more from productivity. And we opted last year really to, in order to make sure that we had a good couple of years of new business bookings, we invested in our head count. And we're now I think at about 7% head count growth year-over-year. That's pretty healthy for us when you look at the last five or six years. It doesn't have an immediate impact because those people have to become productive. They have to get ramped up. They have to get into the field. But as those people mature, that's an investment that should pay off for us for several years to come as those new sales reps become more mature and become more productive over time. So I guess the answer your question is, the reason we feel good about our forecast, which again is subject to interference by, as we just saw the government had a fairly large change in direction nine months ago. So we can't ever say we're 100% sure, but we look at certain metrics that give us confidence in terms of what we have in terms of guidance and it's mainly around head count and modest productivity improvement. Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got it. Okay, thanks. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: And throughout the year, basically, what we'll see is that that accelerated head count growth naturally becomes more productive as that sales force is maturing. And then secondly, it's an easier grow-over. So for your type of modeling, I think those are the two major growth drivers that will make the comparison, the second half of the year look \u2013 that will accelerate the growth in the second half of the year. Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got it. Okay. All right. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one final question. Our final question will come from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, guys. This is Jay Hanna on for Gary today. Thanks for sneaking me in at the end. Just regard to the three-year framework you laid out recently, should we expect any change to that based on the fiscal 2018 guidance increase given this quarter? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I don't think so because as Jan said, I mean I think it's first of all, it's early. We're through the first quarter and I think you could tell that we feel good about our results. We feel good about the future. But I think it's premature. We did get help from tax. We did get a little bit of help from on the growth rate from the floating come. So I think it's just too early. But directionally, we feel good. But I think it's way too early to think about how the first quarter impacts 2020 for us. Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And then with the next-gen tools and migrations you spoke to earlier, is any of that associated with the 500 basis points in margin accretion that you've spoke to recently as well? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: No, the scale and operational improvement that we illustrated in our margin long-term outlook is not counting on these next-generation products making a meaningful impact for that planning horizon, which ends at 2020. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah, and I think part of the reason for that is we've obviously invested a lot already. But now we're in the process of quote-unquote hardening and also getting clients. We do have clients, by the way, on each of the three next-generation platforms. These are real platforms that we've invested hundreds of millions of dollars in over multiple years. So we feel good about it. They're real and they're going to drive long-term efficiency, lower costs, stronger sales, better client experience. But from a timing standpoint, I think it's clearly way too early I think for us to be factoring those types of improvements into our forecast. But for, there is no question that whether it's in 2020 or the last half of 2020 or in 2021 or 2022, these investments are expected to have meaningful impacts on ADP's competitiveness and its profitability as well. Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I'm pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you. As you could see, we're off to a really good start, and we're happy that the initiatives that we have around enhancing our service, the innovation of our products and expanding our distribution model are working. And we have obviously a lot of confidence that I think the investments will continue to deliver the results we expected from those investments, especially in the latter half of fiscal 2018 and beyond. Over the last several months, obviously we've been involved in this proxy contest and I just want to acknowledge for a minute our associates, because obviously, some of them may feel like their efforts have been put into question during this process. And as I mentioned, I think the distraction has been largely to a small group, but inevitably our associates also hear some of the noise out in the market. And I just want to thank our associates for the resolve that they've had in delivering to our clients what the clients expect from ADP. And I also want to thank them for the encouragement they've given to us to continue to move beyond the distraction and continue to deliver valuable services to our clients. The dedication, I think, and the attentiveness and the integrity, more importantly, of our associates is what makes this company great and it's what our founder I think insisted on. And I'm confident that with their help and their support, we're going to continue to make ADP successful. I also want by extension to thank our shareholders and the confidence they've put in our management and our board. As we've gone around visiting and talking to investors, the encouragement that we've gotten from them, I think just strengthened our resolve to continue to do the right thing for them, and also on their behalf. And so with that, I want to thank you again for joining us, and thank you for your interest in ADP. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude the program, and we may all disconnect. Everybody, have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Christine, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP\u2019s Second Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. And all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Christian Greyenbuhl, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Christian Greyenbuhl : Thank you, Christy, and good morning, everyone. This is Christian Greyenbuhl, ADP\u2019s Vice President, Investor Relations, and I\u2019m here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, ADP\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call and webcast. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. Before Carlos begins, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events, and as such, involve some risks. We encourage you to review our findings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Now let me turn the call over to Carlos. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you, Christian, and thank you all for joining our call this morning. We appreciate your interest in ADP. This morning, we reported our second quarter fiscal 2018 results with reported revenue up 8% to $3.2 billion, 7% organic. This revenue growth was slightly above our expectations, and we are pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made so far in the first half of fiscal 2018. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 14% to $0.99 per share and benefited from a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding. We continue to work diligently this quarter to overcome the difficult grow-over from our strong fiscal 2017 second quarter performance. And we are pleased with our overall results, which Jan will take you through in more detail shortly, including some additional information on the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Before I continue further with our operational highlights, I\u2019d like to focus on the execution of our strategy and our innovation efforts. Innovating to help our clients meet the dynamic needs of a rapidly evolving workforce has always been in our DNA and continues to be at the very core of our strategy. More and more, we see workers demanding a greater, ease of access to and functionality of the digital world. Whether it is the convenience offered by our ADP mobile solutions app, the insights delivered by our data cloud offerings or, increasingly, the optionality of flexible payment solutions, it is clear that the worker is at the center of the HCM strategy of tomorrow. While we continue to innovate around our core strengths, such as with our recently announced next-gen payroll and tax platforms, you will also recall that in October, we announced our acquisition of Global Cash Card, which further strengthened our payroll offering with the expansion of digital accounts and flexible payment offerings. This was an exciting acquisition that allows us to further support the evolving needs of our clients, and we are very pleased with the level of client interest in their digital payment services. With this acquisition, ADP became the only HCM provider with a proprietary digital payments processing platform, thus, enabling the opportunity for greater operational efficiency and a seamless client experience. Furthermore, we expect Global Cash Card will allow us to broaden our engagement with our clients' workforce through compelling options to service their flexible pay needs and improve their financial lives, be they traditional or freelance. With the world of work changing, so are our clients' needs. We are proud to be the leading global provider of innovative technology-based HCM solutions across the entire workforce. And with the composition of work increasingly moving toward the freelance worker or gig worker, we have actively pursued going beyond the status quo in order to maintain and expand our industry-leading position. The gig economy is large and continues to grow, with some third-party studies suggesting that between 20% and 30% of today\u2019s labor force is on demand. With over 90% of our mid and upmarket clients already using gig workers and the majority expected to increase their use for the next 3 years, we believe we are uniquely positioned to service this growing market, and it is specifically with this evolution in mind that we believe in having the worker at the center of our strategy and our next-gen solutions. Along these lines, we have continued to differentiate our offerings with the recently announced acquisition of WorkMarket, a leading cloud-based freelance management solution serving both multinationals and small- to medium-sized businesses, allowing them to build and manage their integrative workforce, while aiding them with their important compliance obligations. WorkMarket solutions include comprehensive talent management and compliance solutions to help source and vet freelance workers, manage their engagements and evaluate their performance. In addition, WorkMarket solutions already permit freelance workers on the platform to receive their payments using a Global Cash Card pay card. Our acquisition of WorkMarket establishes ADP as the first HCM provider with robust freelance worker management and payment functionality, with reporting insight and compliance monitoring across the entire labor pool. Acquisitions with strategic fit like Global Cash Card, WorkMarket and last year\u2019s acquisition of TMBC in the talent management space are just one way ADP is helping clients keep pace with change and manage the increasing demand for flexibility in the way people work and how organizations manage their talent. I am proud of our progress to date in our innovation-focused investment strategy to develop open and flexible solutions that can be adopted to meet the needs of any client. We believe that pursuing a healthy mix of acquisitions that align with our strategic priorities, in combination with investments and organically-driven innovation, is the right approach for us to deliver market-leading capabilities to clients that will foster sustainable growth. Now I\u2019d like to cover some operational highlights, starting with new business bookings and retention, both of which continue to show progress and stability against our expectations. As a reminder, we view new business bookings as a metric that demonstrates our ability to drive organic growth, and which represents annualized recurring revenues anticipated from sales to new and existing clients. New business bookings grew 6% for the quarter. We are pleased with the progress from our investments in headcount and product, which are helping reaccelerate our growth, in line with our expectations. And as a consequence, we are maintaining our new business bookings forecast of 5% to 7% growth for fiscal 2018. We are pleased with the progress we are making on our service investments and with the continued improvements in our net promoter scores. We are now substantially complete with our mid-market upgrades and have less than 1% of our mid-market clients left to migrate. We continue to see an improving trend in our Employer Services client loss metrics. And while this quarter\u2019s retention declined slightly by 20 basis points, given the quarterly volatility in this metric, we remain pleased with our year-to-date retention improvement of 70 basis points. We remain on course with our plans to consolidate our real estate footprint and with our associate onboarding across our new strategic locations. As we streamline our service infrastructure and scale our new service centers, we are continuing to see the benefits to both our clients and our associates. Cross-functional teams we have formed in these new sites are leveraging best-in-class service tools and processes to deliver exceptional service to clients across the HCM spectrum in a cost-efficient manner. At the same time, this allows us to better transfer knowledge among these service teams and offer robust career opportunities within the service organization. I\u2019m proud of these efforts and of the speed of execution despite the pressure that comes from our client calendar year-end service deliverables. Now I\u2019d like to take a moment to recognize the PEO business, which as of December 31 surpassed the 500,000 worksite employee mark. In fact, if ADP TotalSource were an independent employer, it would currently rank second among private sector employers in the United States. We are pleased with this business' continued success and with its healthy pace of growth, which demonstrates the value in the market of our broad-based, compliance-oriented HR outsourcing solutions. We have made a lot of progress in executing against our strategy in the first half of 2018, and we remain focused on continuing to accelerate our pace of change through the remainder of the year and beyond. Before I turn the call over to Jan for a detailed financial review, I want to note how proud I am of the unwavering commitment of our associates, and how especially proud I was to see Fortune magazine name us to their Most Admired Companies list for the 12th time. I am particularly proud of this because it is a testament to the confidence our stakeholders place in us and to the continued dedication of our associates who work tirelessly to provide our clients the best solutions for today and tomorrow. And with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jan for further review of our second quarter results. Jan Siegmund : Thank you very much, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. In my commentary to follow, I will be referencing non-GAAP measures that excludes the impact of certain items in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 as well as the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. A description of these items and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found in this morning\u2019s press release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. As Carlos mentioned, ADP revenues grew 8% in the quarter to $3.2 billion, and includes approximately 1 percentage points of benefit from foreign currency. On a reported basis, net earnings declined 8% or 9% on a constant-dollar basis, largely due to the prior year second quarter pretax gain of $205 million related to the sale of our CHSA and COBRA businesses, offset by a onetime fiscal year 2018 second quarter net tax benefit related to the U.S. corporate tax reform of approximately $46 million. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or adjusted EBIT, increased 2% on a reported basis. And it included approximately 1 point of pressure from the impact of acquisitions, the second quarter fiscal year 2017 disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses as well as FX. Adjusted EBIT margin decreased about 120 basis points compared to 19.8% in last year\u2019s second quarter. This decrease was slightly better than our expectations, though we continue to see increased pressure from stronger-than-anticipated growth in pass-throughs and from acquisitions. During the quarter, we have maintained our investments into innovation, service and distribution, and we continue to believe in the benefits of these investments helping us deliver against our long-term financial \u2013 long-term strategic financial objective. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 14% to $0.99. 13% on a constant-dollar basis, and benefited from a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. The enactment in December 2017 of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act includes significant changes to the U.S. corporate tax system, including a federal corporate tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% and, among other provisions, a repeal of the Section 199 domestic production activities deduction as well as new limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter of 25.6% was positively impacted by a lower blended statutory rate of 28.1%, which became effective at the beginning of our fiscal year. This benefit was partially offset by adjustments to access tax benefits on stock-based compensation and foreign tax credits. As a reminder, our adjusted results exclude a net tax benefit of approximately $46 million for onetime items, which encompass the benefit of the reevaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and transition tax on accumulated overseas earnings and a valuation allowance on foreign tax credits. Overall, we have continued to make good progress this quarter. Let me now take you through our segment results before moving on to our updated fiscal year 2018 outlook. In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 6% for the quarter, 4% organic. Our same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.6% in the second quarter. Average client fund balances grew 7% compared to a year ago. This growth was driven by higher payroll volumes in December, resulting from higher bonus activity. Outside the U.S., we continue to see solid performance from our international operations with double-digit revenue growth in our multinational businesses. Employer Services margin decreased about 50 basis points in the quarter and included approximately 70 basis points of pressure from the impact of acquisitions and FX. PEO revenues grew 15% in the quarter, with average worksite employees growing 10% to 498,000. This revenue growth was driven by growth in worksite average \u2013 growth in average worksite employees and from a continued acceleration in the growth of pass-through revenues from the higher health care premiums and higher-than-expected payrolls in the second quarter. This acceleration in pass-throughs was the primary driver for the 30 basis points of decline in the PEO\u2019s reported margins this quarter. I\u2019m pleased with the performance of both of our segments this quarter, while, as Carlos mentioned, we continued to work to accelerate our pace of change for the remainder of the year. Before I disclose our \u2013 discuss our fiscal year 2018 outlook, I wanted to highlight some additional detail regarding the acquisition of WorkMarket. The results of operations of this business will be included in the Employer Services segment and are not expected to materially impact our updated revenue guidance. While we anticipate future synergies from this acquisition and our second quarter acquisition of Global Cash Card, we also anticipate some slight pressure to margins this year, largely driven by acquisition-related costs. Accordingly, we have factored these operational impacts into our updated fiscal year 2018 outlook. With these items in mind, I will now take a moment to walk through our revised outlook with you. First, as Carlos mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our full year new business bookings guidance of 5% to 7% growth on the $1.65 billion sold in fiscal year 2017. With the higher-than-anticipated growth in our pass-through revenues during the first half of fiscal year 2018, we have updated both our consolidated revenue forecast growth to 7% to 8% compared to our prior forecast of 6% to 8%, and our PEO revenue forecast to 12% to 13% from 11% to 13%. Our Employer Services revenue guidance of 4% to 5% remains unchanged. We are also now expecting growth in client fund interest revenues to increase $55 million to $65 million compared with our prior forecasted increase of $45 million to $55 million. The total impact from the client fund extended investment strategy is now expected to be up $45 million to $55 million compared to the prior forecast increase of $35 million to $45 million. The details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. As a result of the growth in pass-through revenues, we have also updated our margin forecast, and now anticipate our consolidated adjusted EBIT margin to contract approximately 50 basis points compared to our previously forecasted contraction of 25 to 50 basis points from 19.8% in fiscal year 2017. Overall, as our investments begin to make an impact, and we lap the easier compares from fiscal year 2017, we continue to anticipate a stronger finish as the year progresses. At a segment level, due to the pass-through pressure, we now anticipate PEO margins to be flat to down 25 basis points compared to our previous forecast of up 25 to 50 basis points. And we continue to anticipate margin contraction in Employer Services of 50 to 75 basis points, which includes approximately 60 basis points of pressure from acquisitions, costs and FX. Adjusting to the anticipated benefits of U.S. corporate tax reform, we now expect our forecasted adjusted effective tax rate of fiscal year 2018 to be 26.9% compared to the 31.7%. This benefit is primarily attributable to the lower blended federal corporate statutory rate of 28.1% for fiscal year 2018. Accordingly, we now expect growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share of 12% to 13% compared to our prior forecast of 5% to 7%. This forecast does not contemplate any further share buybacks beyond anticipated dilution related to equity compensation plans. However, it remains our intent to continue to return excess cash to shareholders, subject to market conditions. Before moving to Q&A, I would like to touch briefly on our long-standing cash allocation strategy, which involves reinvesting in the business, pursuing acquisitions and returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks in that order. As I said earlier, we currently participate \u2013 anticipate an adjusted effective tax rate of 26.9% for fiscal year 2018. And while new IRS guidance or interpretations may change things, we currently anticipate a future effective tax rate excluding any possible onetime items of 25% to 26% beyond fiscal year 2018. Clearly, we are one of the beneficiaries of U.S. corporate tax reform. And while this offers us additional financial flexibility going forward, our priorities, which have delivered strong total shareholder return performance to our shareholders, remain unchanged. So with that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Jason Kupferberg : Thanks guys, good morning. I just wanted to start with a question on the margin outlook, obviously, understandable with the pass-throughs on the PEO side growing faster than expected. But you are still \u2013 it looks like you\u2019re going to move from year-over-year declines in the first half of 2018 to some modest year-over-year increases in margins in the second half. I wanted to see if you can also comment on the trend in underlying margins. I mean, if we exclude the PEO pass-throughs and the floating comment, you\u2019ve talked a little bit about this in the past as far as this being perhaps a more accurate measure of underlying profitability, what are the trends you\u2019re seeing there? Carlos Rodriguez : I\u2019ll make a couple of comments, then maybe Jan can add some \u2013 maybe more specifics. But I think in general, I think the answer is positive trends. Because the other factor that I think you didn\u2019t mention, which you do have to kind of factor in to understand what\u2019s really happening underneath the covers. So besides the PEO pass-throughs, we do have a couple of acquisitions now that are putting a little bit of pressure. And as you can see, the underlying trend must be pretty positive if we are holding to our full-year forecast for EPS and margins and so forth. So I think the fact that we\u2019re able to absorb the pressure, and I think it was mentioned previously that I think it was somewhere along the order of 70 basis points between acquisitions and FX, most of which was acquisitions in the Employer Services segment, I think gives you some sense that I think the underlying trends are positive. And I think it is important to note that as we\u2019ve said before that some of this is related to comparisons and grow-overs. Just as a reminder, last year\u2019s second quarter, we had, I believe, it was somewhere around 20% growth in EBIT and EPS. And I think that gives you some sense of a company our size, and because of the recurring revenue nature of our business that those results last year were the result of the issues around ACA, which gave us tailwind on the revenues before we have lapped the expenses. So we\u2019ve been talking about this now for eight quarters. And I think the \u2013 it starts to get a little bit easier going forward for it to be a little bit more clear what is happening. So maybe I\u2019ll let Jan add a couple of comments. Jan Siegmund : Yes. So if you \u2013 Jason, if you think about our full-year guidance of 50% pressure, ADP-wide, like 30 to 40 bps comes from pressure from acquisitions that we haven\u2019t anticipated, were clearly at the beginning of the year. And the pass-through pressure, if you calculate it out like we did historically, amounts to kind of a very strong 100, 130 bps pressure. So the rest is operational scale. And some of our initiatives that we launched in a year-plus ago are now leaped. And we\u2019re going to see the benefit, increased benefit of that result. So there\u2019s operational scale that we anticipate last year. And that goes really across the entire business system. There\u2019s really not a specific function I can point out because I think the trend is, across the operations, fairly consistent. Carlos Rodriguez : And I think one last thing that I would add is I think what\u2019s easier probably for, which we all should do going forward, is to really focus on ES and focus on PEO separately. There\u2019s really \u2013 there\u2019s only two. It\u2019s fairly straightforward to understand. So if you take the information we\u2019re giving about ES, which we are very transparent about, and we\u2019re also giving you additional color here around the pressure from acquisitions and FX and so forth, you can really figure out that ES is performing well and ahead of our expectations and probably ahead of your expectations. And if you look at the PEO separately, the only issue in the PEO, which is not a negative issue, is that the pass-throughs grew faster than everyone anticipated. And that creates a margin issue. But to be clear, excluding pass-throughs, the PEO, what we call processing revenues, grew at a very healthy pace. And the profitability grew faster than the revenues of the PEO, excluding pass-throughs. And so both segments, I think, are performing well. And the mix that you get is mathematical and shouldn\u2019t necessarily get in the way of us understanding the underlying strength of the business. Jason Kupferberg : Okay, that\u2019s all helpful. Just a quick follow-up on bookings. Obviously, good to see some recovery there in the fiscal second quarter. So you need to deliver, I guess, somewhere in the high single-digit range in the second half to achieve the full-year forecast. Obviously, the comps get easier. We\u2019re now more or less past the key selling season. So I wanted to see if you can just characterize the visibility on the affirmed 5% to 7% target compared to what that visibility looked like a quarter ago, including any sense that you might be able to provide on how January bookings might have trended at least directionally? Thanks. Carlos Rodriguez : As you know, we wouldn\u2019t really comment on our bookings going forward, where \u2013 the call is really to talk about what happened last quarter. And you have our, I guess, maintaining of our 5% to 7%. So I think that would give you some sense that we have confidence that we\u2019ll be able to deliver. But obviously, there\u2019s a lot of \u2013 as always, there\u2019s an unknown. And bookings numbers are always the most unknown number, and this \u2013 and the rest of the business is recurring revenue. Bookings are one week at a time, one day at a time, one month at a time. So you just have to wait and see for the results. But we\u2019re \u2013 as we mentioned in our comments, the headcount growth that we\u2019ve had, the additions to product, like those things will give us some confidence. And I think 6% growth was ahead of our expectations. It was strong. So it feels \u2013 that feels good. And I\u2019ll also just point out that it just so happens that the second quarter new business bookings number is the highest we\u2019ve ever had. So it\u2019s \u2013 I think that\u2019s, I think, a testament to our ability of our sales force to really turn things around. But there\u2019s still a lot of work to do. It\u2019s still a very competitive market. So I think we have a lot of sales still in front of us. We had really good results in our downmarket, as we\u2019ve had for the last several quarters. We had really good results also in our multinational business. And our PEO, I think, also did quite well, just to give you a little bit of additional color. But there\u2019s still a lot of wood to chop, for sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Tien-tsin Huang of JP Morgan. Your line is open. Tien- tsin Huang : Hi, good morning. good bookings here. Just, I guess, you guys mentioned pace of change a couple of times. I\u2019m curious if you can maybe elaborate on what you mean there and what you might do differently in terms of exceeding your strategy, et cetera. Carlos Rodriguez : Yes. Well, it\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s, unfortunately, probably beyond the scope of a brief answer because we have a lot of things going on. But we\u2019ve always had a lot of things going on. So we have quite a number of initiatives that I think some have been \u2013 we\u2019ve been discussing with all of you, some of which we\u2019re not probably ready to start talking about yet. You heard in our comments about our strategic alignment initiatives. You\u2019ve heard about our next-gen platforms, which we hadn\u2019t really discussed up until the fall of last year. So I think that gives you some sense of how much we had going on. And we have other things going as well, including a couple of acquisitions that we\u2019ve mentioned, I think, on the call are pretty significant in the sense that they, despite slight pressure on our margins in the short-term, we\u2019re very, very excited about in terms of what they do, in terms of opening up our \u2013 the possibility of a wider market for us to go after with our existing distribution and sales force. And so we just have a number of initiatives. I wish I could kind of go down the list, but I think it might take longer than we have for the call. But we\u2019re trying to move and to complete our upgrades, which we\u2019re almost done with in the mid-market. We are accelerating \u2013 trying to accelerate the pace of our go-to-market of our next-gen platforms. We want to do that at the right pace, but we\u2019re also trying to do it as quickly as possible because we recognize and we anticipate that it\u2019s going to create a competitive advantage for us. And this is our next-gen payroll platform as well as some of the back-office stuff, tax, including also our local platform, which we discussed as we went on the road to talk to investors back in the fall. So just a lot of great things happening, and we\u2019re excited about trying to accelerate on a number of fronts. Tien- tsin Huang : Great. Just maybe just my quick follow-up for Jan, just the impact on the \u2013 on sort of balance growth from the tax reform. I was a little surprised to see plus 7% for the year if you have 3% prior. Can you \u2013 just a big picture question on that. Jan Siegmund : Yes. We haven\u2019t gotten a balance question for a long time, Tien-tsin, so I appreciate that. The balance growth accelerated for the quarter to about a little bit more than 7%, and there was a percent of FX in it. So excluding FX, the balance growth was 6.6% actually. And the guidance that we give is 4% to 5%. So you see, for the remainder of the year, we anticipate a little bit slower balance growth. And you point out that taxes, which represent about 3/4 of our total client fund balances, are impacted by a lower effective tax rate. And so the estimates \u2013 before I talk about the outlook, in December, we did see higher bonus payment activity, which we attribute maybe to corporate behavior that is related to the corporate tax reform. So was also the growth maybe slightly inflated for the quarter relative to the run rate, but we also had good payroll performance basically in the balances. So for the year, we anticipate 2 to \u2013 1% to 2% kind of potential impact on growth that the corporate tax \u2013 that tax reform in general and the retail rates could have. There\u2019s a little bit of uncertainty. I don\u2019t think nobody really knows exactly how big the impact is going to be on the personal rates, but that\u2019s anticipated. So hence, the 4% to 5% is still better than we had, but it is \u2013 includes this 1% to 2% rough estimate on the lower tax balances basically. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jim Schneider : Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe comment on the broader business environment in the different segments and what you\u2019re seeing in terms of client feedback, either on the overall economy, generally speaking, and/or in terms of the impact of tax reform on their business. How does that translate into bookings, if at all? And generally speaking, is the client tone kind of optimistic? And is it different across the different sizes of the clients? Carlos Rodriguez : So again, we have \u2013 I guess, we can give you some anecdotal information. But I think we like \u2013 because of the size of our company and also the size of our sales force and the geographic disbursement of our folks and our clients, I think it\u2019s best to focus kind of on macro trends. And so we do look at a lot of the macro trends. And we have a lot of information, obviously, around our national employment report and wage inflation. And so far, that gives us some insight. But rather than getting into kind of anecdotal stories, because the anecdotal stories are pretty very positive. Everyone seems to be very positive and very happy. But the \u2013 I think all the numbers that we\u2019re looking at that everyone else looks at, which are important for us to understand in terms of the potential drivers to our business, when you look at Small Business optimism, consumer confidence, like all of these indicators, I think, are all very \u2013 pointing in very positive directions. We look at things also, particularly in our downmarket, around bankruptcies and new business formations. So just a number of economic indicators that are pointing to strong underlying growth. One of the things that\u2019s been a positive surprise to us, I think we had our National Employment Report issued today. And I think this is the second quarter where I think Jan and I would both say that we are pleased, but slightly surprised, by the strength, the underlying strength of growth in employment still. So we\u2019re still kind of bullish and positive that our sales force will be able to take advantage of what\u2019s a very, very strong underlying economy. Our downmarket business and our PEO should hopefully especially be beneficiaries \u2013 other things notwithstanding, should be beneficiaries of this kind of strong ongoing tailwind around Small Business optimism and new business formation. So I think it\u2019s all positive. I think the other factor that obviously will help us as well, and to the extent that it doesn\u2019t then turn into a negative down the road, is to the extent that wage inflation picks up and maybe interest rates begin to tick up, which they are, that obviously helps us in our fluid income business, which we happen to believe is part of our core business. The SEC also agrees with us. As you know, it\u2019s just part of our operating results. And we spent many years having to fight the headwinds. And again \u2013 and if you looked at our margins over the last six or seven years, we absorbed several hundred million dollars in headwind and still managed to either maintain or improve margin slightly in the face of \u2013 if you look at the business that way in terms of the overall ADP margin. So now, we\u2019re looking forward to hopefully getting a little bit of help. And just to put it in perspective, in Q2 of 2008, the average yield on our balances was around 4.5%, and the balances were around $14 billion. Today, our balances are around $22 billion, and our average yield is 1.9. So it just gives you a sense of \u2013 and our margins are higher, obviously, today than they were back then. And we had $116 million or so in float income then and about $104 million or so \u2013 it was $107 million this quarter. So that\u2019s another kind of economic factor that we are looking forward to benefiting from here on a go-forward basis. We have \u2013 I would caution you that we\u2019ve spent the last two or three years expecting that to happen, and it didn\u2019t quite happen. But it does look like, finally, we\u2019re in an environment where not only our balances will hopefully growth at a healthier rate because of wage inflation, but that will bring with it some improvements in interest rates \u2013 at least improvement from our perspective, which is higher interest rates. Jim Schneider : Thanks. And then maybe as a follow-up, can you maybe be a little bit more explicit about how you intend to use the benefits of the corporate tax reform? I know you reiterated the overall capital allocation policy, but some of your competitors have called for reinvesting a substantial portion of that savings in one way or another. So can you maybe clarify what you would intend to do more reinvestment? Or would you CT most of that back to shareholders? Carlos Rodriguez : At the risk of contradicting Jan, who\u2019s our CFO, I would say that I think what Jan stated is actually quite accurate. We are not a capital-constrained business. We never \u2013 we haven\u2019t been for a long time for several decades. So I guess, other companies are in maybe different situations. But we\u2019ve been investing in our business, and we\u2019ve communicated that. And it\u2019s created a little bit of pressure in fiscal year 2018, and it created some pressure five or six years ago. So we\u2019ve \u2013 ADP has always been in growing markets that have a lot of opportunity. And hence, we\u2019ve been in investment mode for a long time. And tax rates and tax policy in our specific situation, if you are perhaps a manufacturer with multinational operations, differences in tax rates might lead to different capital allocation strategies. But we welcome tax reform because we think it\u2019s good for the economy, it\u2019s good for U.S. competitiveness, and that\u2019s good for ADP as well. But our company specifically is not capital- constrained. And so we would anticipate that the majority of the benefits of tax reform will flow to the bottom line. And subject to the board\u2019s approval, things like share buybacks and dividends should flow from that. Having said that, we are looking at some modest increases in our charitable contributions, and perhaps increasing some of the wages of some of our folks who are at 15 \u2013 below $15 an hour. And also, we anticipate having a higher merit-based pool for our merit increases in the next fiscal year. So we are doing some things to, I think, make some investments in our business. But I think the message you should hear is the one that Jan delivered, which is the majority of the benefits of tax reform to ADP\u2019s bottom line should flow through, I think, to shareholders. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is open. David Grossman : Thank you. Carlos, if you just go back to that last question about the macro or in the relatively strong labor markets. And maybe this isn\u2019t kind of the right metric to look at, but your pays per control has stayed relatively stable over the last three years. Could you perhaps at least make the connection between what we\u2019re seeing in the underlying labor markets in that particular metric? Carlos Rodriguez : Yes. I think it\u2019s \u2013 honestly, I think it\u2019s consistent because what happens is the unemployment rate doesn\u2019t always reflect everything that\u2019s happening because, as you know, the underemployment rate has also been coming down. So as people get pulled back into the labor market, that can create underlying growth in labor that might not be reflected in the government\u2019s reported unemployment rate. Our NER number, obviously, doesn\u2019t take into account \u2013 it\u2019s just a pure number of how many people are getting hired each month. And I think the trends there have been strong and consistent, as you said, for several quarters. So I think our pays per control metric, or NER, in my opinion, are better proxies for measuring underlying labor growth, unless you\u2019re willing to go one level deeper in the government\u2019s data and not focus just on the unemployment rate. So I don\u2019t know, Jan probably has a couple of comments. Jan Siegmund : David, I think the delta between the national growth employment, which hovers around 2%, I believe, and our 2.5% pays per control is fairly consistent. So our client base historically has outgrown the economy a tiny bit, and that has to do with company mix and the type of clients we attract. So the trends are strong. And I think what Carlos was indicating in his earlier comments is really a question of how long is the U.S. labor market providing that type of pool for those types of growth rates. And I think you see this in the beginnings of the wage levels increasing and the tighter labor market. So at some point, that could happen. But so far, our trends are very consistent and consistent with the reports of the overall economy. David Grossman : Right. And just \u2013 one point of clarification. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve just forgotten how this was accounted for. But when you divested the consumer-directed benefits business last year, are those numbers still in the historical base? And if so, is that about 100 basis points of headwind to your growth rate this year? Or is that eliminated from the base? Carlos Rodriguez : That is correct. It is \u2013 there\u2019s no more \u2013 not no more, but discontinued ops treatment changed a while back. And so that is one of the things that we have to help you with, both from an acquisition and disposition standpoint of making sure that you guys understand all the ins and outs. And so we just finished lapping that disposition. And it will not be in our numbers on a go-forward basis, but it has put about one point of pressure for the last four quarters on our growth rates. Jan Siegmund : That\u2019s right. And part of the acceleration that you\u2019ll see is driven by that thing growing out, but we also then have acceleration of our organic revenue growth driven by the two incremental acquisitions that we did. So both the impact in the quarter from M&A activity was slightly below 1%. And so all netted out in the quarter. David Grossman : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Rick Eskelsen of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Rick Eskelsen : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Carlos, I just wanted to circle back on your comments earlier about acquisitions. I know for a while you\u2019d really stressed simplifying the business. And now that you\u2019ve made these acquisitions, I\u2019m just wondering if you could sort of tie it into your prior comments about simplification. Did you get the business to a point where it made sense to bolt these things on? Did you see things in the internal environment? Just sort of if you can help us tie it together to your prior strategy. Carlos Rodriguez : It\u2019s a great question because, again, people can convince themselves of anything. So I think we believe that this is not a departure from our strategy around simplification because, frankly, we still have a lot of work to do on that front. So these acquisitions are \u2013 in the case of the Global Cash Card, we did have a card business, but we have a very clear plan that is fairly quick around migrating onto the Global Cash Card platform. So we bought that acquisition, not to keep it as a separate business, to just have another thing hanging off on the side that we go out and sell and have no integration, which is what got us maybe into some challenges over the years. There\u2019s a very clear plan here with a very clear time line and with a very clear benefit. So we feel like we gained a lot in terms of efficiency, innovation and distribution with Global Cash Card. And our plan is to use that platform on a go-forward basis. And I think we mentioned that shortly after the acquisition. So that would be very different from maybe historically some things that we acquired that just basically added another product into the lineup and, in many cases, added another product in a business that we were already in. So as an example, we accumulated several benefits, administration platforms and several payroll platforms over the years, and these acquisitions are really entering new markets that are fast-growing with big upside rather than just accumulating, I guess, additional assets in existing businesses. The WorkMarket acquisition is opening up a whole new category for us, which is independent contractors or freelance workers. So again, like anything in life, we acknowledge that we could look back 2 or 3 years from now and say that was all a rationalization, and it just added more complexity. But we think that the risk/reward here was definitely on the right \u2013 came out on the right side to make these investments. And we\u2019re incredibly excited about what they could do to our top line growth and our new business bookings going forward. Rick Eskelsen : Thank you. Very helpful. Just my follow- up is on the balance sheet, Jan, you saw \u2013 put to a net debt position. Unusual for you guys. I know some of that\u2019s probably due to timing and some acquisition payments. But just sort of talk about your comfort with the balance sheet and staying potentially in a net debt position. Thank you. Jan Siegmund : Yes. I think there\u2019s just really, on the balance sheet, nothing fundamental happen. We had a few short-term movements on the accounts receivable that resolved themselves. We had the acquisition payment. The balance sheet movement is nothing that would concern us. The business generates free cash flow in line with our operating earnings growth. And so I\u2019m not seeing anything. What you see and what you will observe is, due to the rising rate environment, the gains in our client fund portfolio have shifted to a loss, which means, basically, the embedded rate in our client fund portfolio are now lower than the market rates. But since we hold all these securities to maturity, there will be no impact on our operations. So this is to be expected for the portion of the client fund assets that we have on our balance sheet. That should be just mathematical basically. Carlos Rodriguez : And I think \u2013 I would just comment that I think we still have one of the most conservative balance sheets around. And I think that the debt offering that we did, which is now that we\u2019ve returned several billion dollars back in the form of share buybacks over the last few years, as you see our cash balance going down, that\u2019s exactly what we wanted to do. We\u2019re trying to optimize our capital structure. So I would argue we still have a little bit of debt capacity. And I think we\u2019re very happy with our balance sheet, as are the credit rating agencies. And we have all the financial flexibility in the world that we need. So I see it, frankly, as a positive that we\u2019ve worked down our balances through both acquisitions, share buybacks and dividends or cash balances. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from James Berkley of Barclays. Your line is now open. James Berkley : Just on the recent WorkMarket and Global Cash deals, could you speak to the opportunity on the cost and revenue synergy side, particularly as it pertains to helping ADP continue its push towards cloud-based solutions and expand into new markets? Just what percent of your business in terms of revenue is this deal touching \u2013 the deal\u2019s touching? And what size TAM do you see that opening up for you? I know you spoke to new opportunities there as well. Carlos Rodriguez : Listen, it\u2019s a great question. Again, it\u2019s probably beyond the scope of the call, but I\u2019ll try to give you a little bit of color. As with a lot of things that ADP does, I hate to keep saying it, but because of our size, the short- term impact on revenues in the bottom line are not going to be immediately obvious. So then a little bit of pressure on our margin as a result of some dilution. But that\u2019s only really short- term. On the Global Cash Card side, I think we\u2019ve given a ballpark, it\u2019s probably around a $100 million business in terms of revenues. That gives you some sense. We expect that, when it\u2019s combined with our pay card business, to grow faster than the line average of the business. We\u2019ve, I think, mentioned previously in our comments about impact of acquisitions that our acquisition had about a 1% impact on our revenue growth. So I think it gives you a little bit of sizing, if you will. WorkMarket was small, but the technology in the platform \u2013 first of all, it is a cloud-based platform modern technology stack. We anticipate that, that could touch and is an opportunity for our entire client base in the United States in the domestic market. Almost every company from small to large companies use independent contractors or freelance workers. And so, obviously, it\u2019s going to take us some time to make sure that we have the right value proposition of the combination of Global Cash Card with WorkMarket, with our traditional compliance and HCM solutions. But as we work through that, we think that, that opens up an enormous market before us in the kind of the rest of the way people work, which are around freelance work. So I think having the ability to cover both W2, traditional W2 employees as well as freelance workers, I think this opens up a huge opportunity for ADP. The freelance market is growing faster than the W2 way of employing people. And so I think that also allows us to capture that segment of the market, which is clearly growing faster than the traditional part of the economy, which is the traditional W2 employer \u2013 employee. Jan Siegmund : Yes. Just with the market sizing, we have approximately, I think, 170 million W2 workers and about 50 million to 60 million 1099 workers in U.S. according to our market research. So \u2013 and about 90% of our major accounts, the national account clients have meaningful contingent worker employments. So that makes the acquisition that is clearly very early stage, very small today kind of strategically so interesting to us. And so it will do 2 things. I think it will enhance the competitiveness of our core offerings because, over time, this will take a little bit of a while to integrate, but it will become part of our \u2013 deeply integrated into our core HCM platforms. And then we\u2019ll offer, obviously, incremental revenue opportunities to service those gig workers. So for the immediate impact during \u2013 given the small size this business is today, next 18 months, probably not as much, but over time I think a meaningful differentiation going forward. James Berkley : Okay thank you. Yes. I would think, over time, there\u2019d be some ample opportunity there on the margin side, just given the shift to the cloud, and the fact they can touch your entire U.S. ES segment, it looks like. But just as a quick follow-up, just on the \u2013 in terms of you guys are nearing the end of your mid-market migrations, should we see a meaningful benefit to margins from shutting down the old platform at all? Or any color you can give on the progress and timing or expectations for the upmarket as well would be helpful. Carlos Rodriguez : I think the best way to look at it is to see the experience we had in Small Business in our downmarket, which is the shutdown of the platform, of legacy platforms when they occur are \u2013 they have an impact on our margins and our cost. But typically, the largest cost, the largest improvement comes as a result of simplification and focus and ability to really focus on process improvement in a single platform. And that usually evolves over time. So what you\u2019ve seen in the downmarket, I think as we\u2019ve given you color every quarter and every year for the last 3 or 4 years, the day that we shut down the legacy Small Business platform, the next day, we didn\u2019t have this massive margin improvement and an incredible reduction in cost. But over the ensuing 2 or 3 years, we did. And so that business has increased its volume in a significant way in the last 3 or 4 years, and the headcount has remained relatively flat. And we attribute a lot of that to, first, developing the right technology; second, migrating all the clients onto one platform; and third, driving process improvement to take out non-value-added activities and really create value for the clients. And so we anticipate the same thing happening in the mid-markets. So the good news is, if you look at that historical experience in Small Business is that we\u2019re close to the end on phase one. We have the technology. We have the upgrades almost complete. And now, over the next several quarters and years, we anticipate real benefits to accrue to us from the simplification and the focus. Jan Siegmund : And as a reminder, improvement in retention is probably economically the most important factor in this, but we still have a few clients to migrate as we saw in the mid-market in the third quarter. And as we have indicated in the past, we take a very, very careful approach, so that we don\u2019t lose clients in the process unnecessarily. But you never know when you come to the end. But \u2013 so the stabilization of retention rates that we have seen and the improvement, quite frankly, in the mid-market, hopefully, will continue. And that will drive really then incremental profit opportunity by just keeping more clients longer. Carlos Rodriguez : That\u2019s a fair point. It\u2019s great that Jan brought that up because if we go back to Small Business, a main reason why we\u2019ve seen these margin improvements, efficiency improvements and client experience improvements is because of all things I mentioned about one platform simplification. But clearly, we have much higher retention rates in the downmarket than we did 4 or 5 years ago. And that obviously leads to incredible improvement in the economics of these businesses. Operator : Our next question is David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning. Historically, Carlos, ADP\u2019s seen a nice pickup in demand whenever there\u2019s major changes in the tax code. And I think, historically, those changes have created more complexity, which drives the increased demand. Could you talk about U.S. corporate tax reform in terms of whether you think it creates more complexity or more simplicity and how the impacted tax reform longer term might impact demand for ADP services, both in ES and in PEO. Jan Siegmund : Yes. David, if I jump ahead of Carlos here, I would rate the impact on our tax filing business as relatively neutral at this point in time. So the changes were relatively easy to implement, and I don\u2019t think that has fundamentally changed the complexity of the payroll business. Going forward, I think there\u2019s a high degree of uncertainty as states evaluate their reactions and their consequent steps to the overall changes of the compact of the overall tax bundle that was created. And in theory, it could make it complex. If states is going to change their attitude of how they want to tax their constituencies, it could. But I think that\u2019s very speculative today. So my answer would be fairly neutral at this point. We\u2019re implementing and implemented those tax rate changes fairly quickly. And that itself was not a big trigger point. I think the increased liquidity and the increased cash inflow from overseas and all that stuff should be a stimulus in the U.S. economy. And I think we\u2019re seeing certainly immediate results from that from all the reactions that you also read in the newspaper. So that should help the overall economy, and that will be positive for us. That\u2019s kind of my overall assessment. David Togut : Got it. And just as a quick follow-up. You called out strength in bookings in the quarter, both in downmarket and multinational accounts. Could you give us an update on demand trends in the mid-market and also in U.S. national accounts? Carlos Rodriguez : Yes. I mean, I\u2019d say that, again, this quarter, because, again, it\u2019s \u2013 the bookings number, like the retention number, can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. But I\u2019d say we held our own. I mean, obviously, if I didn\u2019t mention them when I talked about our strength. And they weren\u2019t on a relative basis as strong, but I can tell you that compared \u2013 it\u2019s all about relativity. So the relative performance of our mid-market and upmarket are much better this quarter than last year\u2019s second quarter. But the growth itself was strongest and driven by the businesses that I mentioned previously. But it is important to note that from a \u2013 trend-wise that we are very happy with the direction that our mid-market and upmarket businesses have taken. We had a nice increase in the quarter, for example, in new business bookings on our Workforce Now platform in the upmarket, above 1,000, which I think we\u2019ve kind of reinvigorated that offering in that product to really compete in a segment of the upmarket where it competes very, very well for particular types of clients. So we had a nice growth versus the prior year in terms of the total number of units in the upmarket on our Workforce Now platform. And then on Vantage, we \u2013 I would say we held our own versus the previous year in terms of new client count sales. So I\u2019d say we\u2019re pleased and still working through a grow-over issue that the second quarter of last year was the last quarter where we saw meaningful ACA sales in our business. And so that gives you some sense of why I can\u2019t be as positive because it\u2019s just mathematically difficult. It was mathematically difficult. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. Your line is open. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Thank you. Carlos, a question on PEO services. You\u2019ve commented, obviously, in the past about the continued strength in worksite employee growth. It was a pretty solid 10% this quarter. Given what\u2019s happening with both ACA funding and the low unemployment rate, do you think PEO growth might taper off in the next couple of years as we get into late cycle? And any thoughts on sort of the multiyear view on that? Carlos Rodriguez : I think it\u2019s a great question, and I wish I had a crystal ball. We\u2019re not planning on it. So our headcount plans and our investments, I think, are not planning for a deceleration. We\u2019re going to try to continue the growth because the opportunity is still there. The value proposition is very strong. But I think you\u2019re absolutely asking a fair question, which is we have to be \u2013 and this is a place for us to be cautious in terms of we happen to have very strong pass-through growth, which gives us healthy top line growth. But that obviously has a margin impact, and it makes things hard to read. But the worksite employee count growth is really the right place to focus on, and I think that double-digit growth is still quite strong and, I think, quite satisfying to us. But I think it\u2019s something that we have to keep an eye on. We have a lot of tailwinds in our business as a result of ACA. I have said during it, not just afterwards, that it felt like we were getting some tailwinds. And obviously, those tailwinds have abated. So I think it\u2019s just become harder in the PEO business. Jan Siegmund : I think my one thought that might be also helpful is if you see health care inflation, that means our clients' experience, higher benefit renewals, basically, and that causes, obviously, more thinking in the clients. And so you have to be very thoughtful that you remain committed in your benefit offerings. But overall, faster inflation, I think, will create just focus on the value proposition, which is exactly why we have to pay attention to it and be thoughtful. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Understood, thank you for that. And then the follow-up question\u2019s on the WorkMarket activation. It seems like a good one, the gig economy in general. Will gig economy workers be included in your pays per control metric as they flow in and out? I mean, how should one treat them vis-a-vis a permanent employee? And I think you addressed this, but this is more of a technology play. So I assume you don\u2019t have to go make many similar acquisitions to build scale. Carlos Rodriguez : That is correct. It\u2019s a technology acquisition. And I think that as we\u2019ve always talked about pays per control, our pays per control is a subsegment of our total pays in ADP because we want to use one platform in order to be able to isolate same-store sales growth. And so, for example, our pays per control metric that we report doesn\u2019t include every platform that ADP has to begin with. And hence we would not anticipate including WorkMarket in that. And as WorkMarket becomes bigger, this is probably a few years down the road, we\u2019ll find a way to give you that metric separately, right, because I think it\u2019s important. Because my sense is that\u2019s going to grow very rapidly, and it might be of interest to the external market. But I think, for now, it\u2019s business as usual. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Silber of BMO. Your line is open. Henry Chien : Hi, thanks. It\u2019s Henry Chien for Jeff. I just wanted to follow up on the pass-through revenues just to make sure I\u2019m understanding this correctly. Is the uptick there, is that more a function of product mix and, say, just increases in premiums? I\u2019m just trying to understand if there\u2019s any change in the underlying growth rate for either PEO or Employer Services and any changes there, I think. Carlos Rodriguez : I think it\u2019s probably \u2013 I think Jan has some details, but I would say that \u2013 it\u2019s safe to say that the Affordable Care Act, as a result of either the law itself, because I don\u2019t want to make a political statement here, but I think health care inflation is higher, let\u2019s just say, in general, than it was 2 or 3 years ago. And we serve 500,000 worksite employees, most of which have health care, and it\u2019s part of the value proposition that our clients come to us for. And hence, we would not be immune from that, and our clients would not be immune from that, especially given that we treat this as, \"a pass-through.\" And so I think it\u2019s that simple. There\u2019s really not \u2013 there\u2019s not a big mix issue here, and it\u2019s higher health care inflation. And by the way, we\u2019ve had that \u2013 we\u2019ve owned this PEO for a long time, and we\u2019ve been through other periods of accelerating health care inflations. So this is not unusual in the historical context. Jan Siegmund : Yes. The pass-throughs are growing faster than our worksite employee count. For that reason, the pass-throughs are harder to forecast because there\u2019s a number of factors that drive this. It starts with the actual renewal that we get on our policies. And then, obviously, with the lineup that our clients, the employers choose and the plan mix that they offer to their employees, and then what plans employees are actually choosing in enrollment period. And we have seen higher renewals, which is the health care inflation that Carlos mentioned, and that\u2019s a large chunk of the faster growth above our worksite employee growth. But we have also seen \u2013 now comes the 201 inside that employee is choosing slightly richer plans, and then they have a slight mixed shift away from the lowest offering to a little bit of richer plan and mix. So that\u2019s \u2013 what we have seen throughout enrollment season. And so the vast majority is health care inflation, but there\u2019s some little mixed shift in the pass- through growth as well. Henry Chien : Okay. Great it had actually helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you, And we have time for one more question, which comes from the line of Mark Marcon of R. W. Baird. Your line is open. Mark Marcon : Good morning. And thanks for taking my question. Carlos, you\u2019ve got a long history on the PEO side, and I was wondering if you could share your perspective on 2 fronts. One would be like where do you think we are in terms of the maturation of the PEO concept? And specifically across the country, when we take a look, obviously, Florida, Texas, well penetrated, more mature. But when we think about the country broadly speaking outside of those markets or maybe a couple of other states, where do you think we are in terms of the evolution? And then secondly, could you comment a little bit about the balkanization that we\u2019re seeing with regards to regulations? When we take a look at states like California, New York, et cetera, we\u2019re starting to see all sorts of different regs that are popping up. That must make it difficult to be in compliance. Carlos Rodriguez : Yes. I think on the first point, I just \u2013 I think my reaction about the question about the PEO, first and foremost, is to say, my immediate reaction is pride, right? So what\u2019s happened to that business in the last 18 or 19 years as ADP has owned it, if we could do a few of those, would certainly make a difference for the company. And I think that what drove the success, besides a lot of hard work from a lot of people, and a lot of good execution was the fundamental strength, the value proposition and the underlying trends. And I think those still are intact. So despite the comments you made about penetration in some states improving over the years, it\u2019s still really a relatively small part of the market that\u2019s served by PEOs. So \u2013 and it\u2019s tied to the second part of your question, which is, unless you believe that all of a sudden it\u2019s going to get easier to be an employer \u2013 and I think Jan touched on this a little bit around tax and the fact that states might have different views on how to deal with tax reform from their perspective. And then tying that to the second part of your question, one of the good things for ADP is that since ADP has existed and since this country has existed, there\u2019s been a non-ending trend towards more complexity around being an employer or even being a corporation. And we clearly now have a focus on deregulation from the current administration. But you have to take that in context. A lot of that is around energy and other sectors of the economy, in some cases, appropriately so probably. But again, without making political statements, it\u2019s safe to say that the task of being an employer at either the federal level or the state and local level because it matters. It\u2019s not just about headlines around what the federal government is doing, it\u2019s also around what you\u2019re talking about, is if you\u2019re an employer in multiple states, you have a very difficult task keeping up with all of the various regulations that are intended to push forward public policy at the state level, if not at the federal level. And so that is all kind of a dream situation, if you will, for ADP because companies should be focused on their core business and on executing on their companies not on trying to deal with all of these changes in the regulation. And the majority of companies want to be in compliance with these regulations. So I think it affects not just the PEO, but it affects the overall ADP business. And I think we remain as optimistic today as we ever have. That\u2019s probably why the industry in general, the HCMs in general is growing faster than GDP. And ADP, with its strong compliance orientation, probably has an even greater benefit because of the DNA that we have around helping clients deal with the complexity that you\u2019re describing. So I think answer number one is, I think the PEO\u2019s not done in terms of the opportunity that\u2019s out there just because of simple mathematics. That doesn\u2019t mean or guarantee that the execution will be there because we have to still execute, and the rest of the industry has to execute. But I think the opportunity is still definitely there. And then secondly, you touched on a very important point that I think Jan kind of also touched on, which is we don\u2019t see any abatement in the complexity and the difficulty of being an employer in the United States. Mark Marcon : Great. That\u2019s precisely where I was getting at. And then, I mean, just to boil it down on the long runway. I mean, if you were putting it in baseball terms, would you say PEO is maybe in the third or fourth inning in terms of penetration? Or how would you characterize it? Carlos Rodriguez : I\u2019m going to let Jan answer that question because he\u2019s an expert in baseball. Jan, do you know how many innings there are in baseball? I can answer that question. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s \u2013 it probably shouldn\u2019t be in the business we\u2019re trying to forecast. I think the \u2013 I would focus really, like I always do, on the math, right? The number of \u2013 the total \u2013 I think the industry says that there are about 2 million \u2013 you probably know better than I do, Mark, but I think the PEO industry says that there\u2019s about 2 million people under PEO arrangements, maybe 2.5 million. And Jan said there\u2019s 170 million private sector employees. We know that, obviously, this is a downmarket and mid- market type of value proposition. There\u2019s 26 million people on our own payroll systems, as we report every \u2013 to you on a regular basis. And we have 500,000. So I think anyway you look at it, it looks like there\u2019s plenty of opportunity. But I think it\u2019s dangerous for me to use a baseball analogy because you\u2019ll probably remind me of it for the next 5 or 10 years. Mark Marcon : I won\u2019t do that. Okay, congratulation. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : And this does conclude our question-and-answer session portion for today. I\u2019m pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for any closing remarks. Carlos Rodriguez : Thanks. I think as you can see, we\u2019re very pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made on our strategic initiatives during the first half of the year. And we also want to just reiterate our welcome to our colleagues from WorkMarket to ADP, and we look forward to the success we\u2019re going to have together. It\u2019s acquisitions like these, along with the investments we\u2019ve made in the next-gen solutions that I think demonstrate our commitment to progress and our commitment to our transformative strategy. As you can probably tell from the call, we also are anything but status quo here at ADP. We intend to move forward with pace and with conviction. We\u2019ve talked to our leadership about moving with urgency, but also with care because our client experience and our retention rates are also incredibly important. And lastly, I\u2019ll say that we carefully listened and learned from all of our shareholder engagements during the proxy contest. And I think they decided the things we learned. It also strengthened our resolve to accelerate the execution of the strategy that I think was \u2013 I think on the right path to begin with. But there\u2019s nothing wrong with a little bit of acceleration. Our markets are changing. The nature of work is changing. I think that creates opportunity. And it creates, as we said, in some cases, complexity for employers. And I think that\u2019s good for ADP. So I thank you for joining the call today. We look forward to continuing to share the details of our journey with you down the road, and we appreciate your interest in ADP. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude today\u2019s program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

O'Neill - Autonomous Research US LP Operator : Good morning. My name is Christy, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Third Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Conference Call. I would like to inform you that this call is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Christian Greyenbuhl, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Christian Greyenbuhl - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you, Christy, and good morning, everyone. This is Christian Greyenbuhl, ADP's Vice President, Investor Relations, and I'm here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call and webcast. Before I hand the call over to Carlos, I want to give you a brief reminder about our upcoming Investor Day. The event will be held on June 12th in New York City, and we have an exciting agenda planned that will showcase our new products, and include an update on our business and transformation initiatives. We look forward to seeing you there. Moving on to the quarter, I'd like to remind you that during our call today, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors, and that include the impact of certain items in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as well as the third quarter of 2017. A description of these items and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found in this morning's press release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Now, let me turn the call over to Carlos. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you, Christian, and good morning, everyone. This morning we reported our third quarter fiscal 2018 results with reported revenue up 8% to $3.7 billion, 6% on an organic constant currency basis. We are pleased with the strong revenue growth for the quarter and we are especially pleased with our quarterly Employer Services revenue retention, which increased 170 basis points. In our PEO segment, average worksite employee growth was 9% for the quarter, slightly below our expectations, though we continue to see strong demand particularly in the down-market. Our solid 9% new business bookings growth this quarter was in line with expectations as we continue to see improving demand for our HCM solutions. Our down-market and international businesses continued to perform well, and we were also encouraged by the performance of our up-market offerings compared to a difficult third quarter in fiscal 2017. As you can see from our reported results, we continue to see broad-based progress from investments we made in our sales force, and are therefore, increasing our fiscal 2018 new business bookings guidance growth to 6% to 7% from 5% to 7%. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 16% to $1.52 per share as we delivered improving adjusted EBIT performance and benefited from a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding. Overall, our earnings growth in the quarter exceeded our expectations and we're happy with our strong performance, which Jan will walk you through in more detail shortly. Now, I'd like to discuss our innovation efforts and how they remain at the core of our strategy. We're continuing to invest in a new breed of HCM solutions that we anticipate will address the evolving needs of millions of workers every day and we're proud to be recognized for it. Most recently, Constellation Research recognized our suite of HCM solutions as a leader in helping enterprises navigate the barriers in doing business in today's global economy. They further noted that we have turned the Innovation Corner and described ADP as an innovative next-gen HCM vendor and a leader in big data, machine learning, and user experience. Additionally, earlier this week at Facebook's F8 conference, we launched an integration with Facebook's enterprise solution, Workplace. Now, clients using ADP for HR and payroll solutions and Workplace by Facebook for employee collaboration can offer teams access to pay and time-off information within Facebook's enterprise environment through an ADP virtual assistant that utilizes chat. This application is available now in our ADP Marketplace. As we continue to invest around our core strengths, we also remain strategic in the acquisitions we make. Last quarter, we discussed Global Cash Card, an acquisition that enables us to broaden engagement with our clients' workforce with compelling flexible payments, and WorkMarket which established ADP as the first HCM provider with freelance worker management and payment functionality. These acquisitions will enable us to drive higher market share across the entire labor pool, while we help our clients keep pace with change and manage the increasing demand for flexibility. We remain committed to supporting these investments and innovation with our business transformation efforts, and with our mid-market migrations now behind us, we continue to make good progress on transforming our organization with the client service experience top of mind. This quarter, we launched a voluntary early retirement program, we believe, will help us streamline our operations and help us drive incremental margin expansion in fiscal 2019 and beyond. In addition, we have accelerated the execution of some incremental strategic initiatives this quarter, which we believe will continue to help us enhance our productivity and efficiency. Jan will take you through some of the details of these initiatives shortly. We believe that our focused initiatives will help us continue to deliver long-term value for ADP, our associates, and our investors. As we have mentioned before, it takes time and attention to detail to drive successful change and avoid major disruptions. Since embarking on our Service Alignment Initiative almost two years ago, our associates have worked tirelessly to meet and exceed our targets, while simultaneously increasing client satisfaction. I'm proud of our progress and I'm happy to tell you that as of this month, we exceeded our fiscal 2018 exit target and have now closed approximately 90% of our 68 targeted subscale service locations. We have done all this and more while undergoing a large multiyear client migration in the mid-market, which I'm proud to announce we have now completed. We continue to extend our efforts to simplify our organization and service tools, and are pleased with the progress we are making, and in particular, with the 170 basis point increase in retention this quarter, which was slightly ahead of our expectations. We look forward to discussing our strategy and the strength of our business at our upcoming Investor Day in June. We continue to believe that our unique ability to meet the needs of our clients today while anticipating their needs tomorrow will drive our sustained growth. Before I turn the call over to Jan, I want to take a moment to acknowledge how proud I am of our talented and dedicated associates. I would also like to recognize the contributions and accomplishments of our associates who have decided to participate in our voluntary early retirement program. These tenured associates have helped shape ADP into who we are today, and we look forward to working with them through the upcoming transition period. The transition will be thoughtfully managed and reflective of our deep appreciation of their service to ADP. We also continue to focus our efforts on attracting, training, and retaining top talent. In fact, this quarter, we were honored to be included among LinkedIn's 2018 Top Companies. This award highlighted the top 50 companies that were most in demand by jobseekers. This recognition along with our other achievements affirms our strategy, enhances our value proposition, and lays the groundwork for long-term growth. I continue to be impressed and proud of the unwavering commitment of our associates. Our stakeholders place the utmost confidence in us because of the tireless efforts of our associates in providing our clients the best solutions for today and tomorrow. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jan for further review of our third quarter results. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you, Carlos, and hello, everyone. Before I proceed with a deeper dive on our financial results, I would like to talk a little bit about our transformation initiatives. As Carlos highlighted, we continue to execute on our transformation initiatives, and this quarter, we recognized approximately $40 million of charges which are excluded from our non-GAAP results. Some of the anticipated benefits from these investments were already contemplated in our September 2017 investor presentation, while other incremental investments made this quarter are focused on expanding our productivity improvement initiatives to further drive our transformation efforts. We believe the benefits from these investments will continue to help us deliver against our long-term financial objectives. I also want to be clear that the $40 million of charges are not related to our previously announced voluntary early retirement program. We expect the benefit of this program to begin help reduce our pre-operating expenses starting early fiscal year 2019. With that said, let us now dive into the financial update. As Carlos mentioned, ADP reported revenues grew 8% in the quarter to $3.7 billion, and we now fully lapped the pressure from the fiscal year 2017 sale of our CHSA and COBRA businesses. We are happy with this revenue growth and with the performance of our recent strategic acquisitions as we continue to work towards fully integrating them into our suite of offerings. On a reported basis, earnings before income taxes increased 3%. Our adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT increased 8%, and included approximately one combined point of lift from FX and the impact from our fiscal year 2018 acquisitions. Adjusted EBIT margin decreased about 20 basis points compared to 24.6% in last year's third quarter and was better than our expectations. We were pleased with our margin performance as we continued to overcome pressure from acquisitions and growth in our PEO pass-through revenues, and benefited from operating efficiencies, largely driven by improvements in our infrastructure spend as well as incremental sales efficiencies. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 16% to $1.52, and benefited from a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with the year ago. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter of 24.3% was aided by the release of reserves related to uncertain tax positions and the benefit of a tax accounting change which resulted in certain assets of investments being eligible for accelerated expensing. We continue to expect an effective tax rate, excluding any possible onetime items, of 25% to 26% beyond fiscal year 2018. Additionally, in April, our board of directors approved a 10% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.69 per share. This increase will be funded by a portion of the benefits we received from the Tax Cuts and Job Act (sic) [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act] in the U.S. Our board expects to consider another dividend increase in November 2018 consistent with ADP's 43-year track record of annual dividend increases and our commitment to returning cash to shareholders. As a reminder, ADP has historically targeted a 55% to 60% dividend payout ratio. Overall, we have continued to make good progress this quarter. Let me now take you through our segment results before moving on to our fiscal year 2018 outlook. In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 7% in the quarter, 4% organic constant currency. Our same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.9% in the third quarter. Average client fund balances grew 6% or 5% on a constant dollar compared with a year ago. This growth was driven by a combination of wage inflation and growth in our pays per control, offset by about 3% of combined pressure from lower state unemployment insurance collections as well as corporate tax reform. Outside the U.S., we continued to see solid performance from our multinational businesses with double-digit revenue growth. Employer Services margin decreased about 20 basis points in the quarter and continued to include approximately 70 basis points of combined impact from acquisitions and FX. PEO revenues were 10% in the quarter with average worksite employees growing 9% to 512,000. This worksite employee growth was slightly below our expectations due to, in part, a softer growth in the 50 employee and above market. The PEO segment's margins this quarter increased 40 basis points which was largely a function of lower selling expenses. I will now take a moment to walk through our revised outlook with you. First, as Carlos mentioned earlier, we are raising our full year new business bookings guidance to 6% to 7% growth from our previous guidance of 5% to 7%, and we are reaffirming our consolidated revenue growth forecast of 7% to 8%. For the Employer Services segment, we now anticipate revenue growth of about 5% as compared to our previous guidance of 4% to 5%. While for the PEO, we are revising our revenue guidance to growth of about 12% as compared to our previous guidance of 12% to 13%. We are also now expecting growth in client funds interest revenue to increase approximately $65 million compared with our prior forecasted increase to $55 million to $65 million. The total impact from client funds extended investment strategy is now expected to be up about $50 million compared to the prior forecasted increase of $65 million (sic) [$45 million] to $55 million. The details of this forecast can be found on slide 8 in our investor presentation which is available in our Investor Relations website. As we continue to see some of the benefits from the acceleration of our transformation initiatives, we now anticipate our consolidated adjusted EBIT margin to be about flat compared to our previously forecasted contraction of 50 basis points from 19.8% in fiscal year 2017. Overall, as you can tell from our guidance adjustment, our accelerated investments begin to make an impact. As we have easier compares in the fourth quarter, we continue to anticipate a strong finish for the year. At a segment level, most of this incremental margin performance is coming from Employer Services segment, where we now expect margins to be about flat compared to our previously forecasted contraction of 50 to 75 basis points. This revised ES guidance continues to anticipate approximately 60 basis points of pressure from acquisitions cost and FX. For the PEO, we now anticipate margins to be about flat compared to our previously forecasted flat to down 25 basis points. As a result of the incremental benefits of our third quarter adjusted effective tax rate, we now anticipate an adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 of 26.2% compared to our previously forecasted 26.9%. We were pleased with our performance this quarter and with the momentum of our transformation initiatives. Accordingly, we now expect growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share of 16% to 17% compared to our prior forecast of 12% to 13%. This forecast does not contemplate any further share buybacks beyond anticipated dilution related to equity compensation plans. However, it remains our intent to continue to return excess cash to shareholders, subject to market conditions. So, with that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will take our first question from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Good morning, guys, and nice set of results. I just wanted to start on margins, obviously, good to see the guidance increase there. So, you're now looking at flat year-over-year, which I think implies that your June quarter will be up almost 300 basis points. I know that benefits from an easy comp, but nonetheless much better than previously envisioned. So, given that the benefits of the early retirement program won't even start kicking in until next fiscal year, how should we start thinking about the potential margin expansion trajectory for fiscal 2019 relative to the multiyear outlook you had given last-September? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Jason, thank you. As you know, we will give guidance later in the year for 2019. But in addition to having completed our migrations, making progress on our Service Alignment Initiatives, and an easier compare relative to investments that we made last fourth quarter, in particular into our sales force, we have a number of sources that will drive the margin expansion in the fourth quarter that we anticipate. The early retirement initiative is really going to be kicking in in 2019 as we then work on the transition of those workers who have chosen \u2013 employees that have chosen the early retirement in 2019. I hope that's helpful. Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. I'm sure we'll get more color at the Analyst Day. Just for my follow-up, any callouts on the strong retention result as well as the strong bookings growth? I mean, I know the bookings forecast change isn't big, but nonetheless you are nudging it up. So, I was just curious if there was any parts of the end market there that have improved more notably than others? And then, along the same line, as it relates to retention, does it seem like these underlying trends are sustainable now that the mid-market migrations are complete? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: So, I think on the sales \u2013 on the new business bookings growth, given the absolute size of our new business bookings, the change in guidance for us \u2013 you're right, it's relatively modest in percentage terms, but I think the sales force would say that's pretty meaningful, because it's a lot of additional dollars in new business bookings. On the retention side, we did have an easier compare versus last year. If you remember, we \u2013 I think every call, I think I just caution everyone that because of the way we calculate revenue retention on a quarterly basis, if you have one or two large losses, it can really impact the numbers, even given ADP's size, it can have an impact... Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Right. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: ...on the retention. And I think last year in the third quarter was one of those quarters. And then, again, here now I have to say the opposite, which is when you have a great quarter and you don't have a lot of large losses, which we didn't have this quarter, it helps. And so, I think that was part of it. But I would say that the improvement was broad-based, so you can obviously by my comments see that a lot of that improvement was in the up-market and some of that is an easier compare. But we also have had really good results in our mid-market, which as you know, it's been a multiyear effort to kind of climb back in terms of the retention pressure that we felt a few years back as a result of ACA activity, and also as a result of the migrations that we've undergone there. So, I'm very proud of the mid-market retention results as well, but I think other places also \u2013 so, I guess as usual at ADP, since we are so diversified in terms of segment and geography, for us to have a large improvement in retention of that magnitude it has to be somewhat broad-based and I think it was. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Maybe I'll add two components to your answer, Carlos. Number one, the positive trend in retention is supported by continued improvement of our client satisfaction scores, also a broad-based improvement, which means our investments that we undertook last year into our service components are really taking root, and as a consequence, our service operations are also very good at this point in time. So, I think those investments have translated then broad-based into and supported some of the retention improvement that we saw on the quarter. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah. I actually received a note last night from one of our business unit leaders with an update on our client satisfaction scores. We measure NPS and the trend there is incredibly positive. They even used the term service renaissance because we did have some struggles and stumbles a couple years ago, and I think our client satisfaction stores now have been on a multi-quarter kind of upward trajectory, admittedly from some difficult compares, but doing really quite well. Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Terrific. Nice job. Thanks for the comments. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: And sorry, last comment on that, on the other \u2013 on the client satisfaction side is that, one of the things that we were careful about in terms of our Strategic Alignment Initiative is making sure that it didn't disrupt our \u2013 we had, I think our number one objective was to improve client satisfaction and NPS scores, and things like Strategic Alignment Initiative and early retirement have the potential to disrupt that. But the good news is, obviously, early retirement, we still have to execute on, but the Strategic Alignment Initiative, I'm happy to report our leaders have executed flawlessly there and actually have gotten great client satisfaction in those new strategic locations, which is not easy to do because we have a lot of new associates in those locations. Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. Your line is open. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Hi, Carlos. How are you? So, I want to go back to the topic of retention. Obviously, it's a volatile metric as you mentioned, but assuming that the high attrition is also linked with the new service delivery, I guess the question is, do have to maintain the level of spend on service delivery or is there more of a \u2013 or was that more of a technology spend that you can now scale up on, if that makes sense? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Well, to be \u2013 I mean, Jan could probably add a couple of comments, but to be clear, like we \u2013 in some of our businesses where we've had large increases in client satisfaction and large increases in NPS and large increases in retention, our service spend has actually declined. So, we're \u2013 obviously, part of our business transformation efforts are to get better at \u2013 as you know, one of our key objectives in our initiatives is to reduce the number of, what we call, non-value-added contacts which drive costs, but don't drive value for our clients. So, there are places where we've invested more in service, and as you can see, we've also invested in sales. But there are places where we have done both improved productivity, improved efficiency, and actually, better results from a retention and a client satisfaction standpoint. And that's obviously our hope for the next X-number of years for us to be able to drive operating leverage and improve margin, that's kind of an important thing for us to be able to accomplish. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah. I've only two additional details to add. The investments that we made into service augmented, in particular in the mid- and up-market, our capabilities to service our larger clients better, in particular with dedicated service reps. But then we have a whole slew of productivity initiatives that Carlos mentioned that will drive efficiency and effectiveness of our service cost. And the most obvious one is, obviously, our new strategic service locations are labor cost advantaged and we have now a simpler operating environment, a single platform. We finished our migrations in the mid-market that will allow to implement faster productivity improvements and optimization of our operations. So, with that combination, higher service levels and through strategic changes to our service model, paired with efficiency and effectiveness initiatives, and so I think we will be able to achieve both. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: And as much as it might not be directly related to our new business bookings growth, I would say that I think these efforts around simplification, improved client satisfaction and some of the other things that Jan mentioned, I think really should help our sales force as well. I mean, when we went through some challenges a couple of years ago, there was just a lot of distraction, not to mention a very difficult grow over. Obviously, the number one issue was just the grow over around ACA, but some of the service challenges we had were also a distraction to our sales force. So, I think getting that behind us, I think, should help as well. Because, again, despite the fact that it was a modest improvement in new business bookings growth guidance, it was an increase, and this quarter, we're pretty proud of 9% bookings growth after really suffering for several quarters here with very, very difficult grow overs and compares. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Those are good points. So, but then \u2013 I guess the follow-up question becomes, it sounds from your comments, there is a margin benefit coming from the combination of retention and maybe the spend on service delivery going down over time as you scale that margin benefit from voluntary termination. So, would you \u2013 is your preference to reinvest those savings and to what degree, and how much might flow to the bottom line becomes the obvious question? And then, the other part of it is, in general, are there other explicit things other than the voluntary termination program that you're planning, if you could talk about that? Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: You came to the right place for the answer to that question. Jan wants it all the flow to the bottom line and I want to reinvest some of it. So, the truth will be somewhere in between, and you'll know more when we give our guidance for 2019 and also when we, in Investor Day, give you kind of a longer-term I guess objective view of what we think margins will do over the ensuing couple of years. So, I think unfortunately we're just a little premature in being able to get out in front of talking about kind of multiyear margin improvement, but I just want to add that foundationally, all the things you said are dead-on in terms of there is the possibility and the capability for us to drive improved margin. This is what we've been trying to talk about. For the last two or three years, we've been laying the groundwork with all of these initiatives, Strategic Alignment Initiative, completing the migrations, voluntary early retirement, these are all intended to help us be a stronger, more profitable company. But stronger is the first word and that means that sometimes you have to invest some. I will add that there is no question that the underlying margin trend is positive for us, so we feel very good about that. But again, I think it's just a little premature to get too far out in front of ourselves here in terms of what exactly the numbers are going to be. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. Thank you, gentlemen. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI : Thank you. Good morning. Could you comment on pricing net of discounting? We're picking up some modest improvement in price increases of 1.5% in our payroll manager surveys, at least from your clients, and I'm curious whether you're seeing that from your broader base of clients as well? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: So, the targeted impact of price increases net of any immediate concessions or discounts that we would receive is about 0.5% of our revenue growth and we've that stable for a number of quarters now. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah. I think, our \u2013 obviously, we have a much broader dataset than I think maybe the sampling that some folks might do out in the marketplace. But the fact of the matter is I think we have seen really no change in the kind of the environment from a pricing standpoint. I think our intent is to remain consistent which is to remain competitive. As you can see, the underlying inflationary trends with labor costs accelerating a little bit are on an upward trajectory. But these things, they play themselves out over multiple quarters and multiple years. It's not like overnight, all of a sudden the pricing environment changes. But I would say that there's probably \u2013 the future appears to have more pricing power than the past in terms of the last decade. But right now, I think no news to report and we would obviously give you kind of a sense if that's beginning to change. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI : Understood. And then as a follow-up, also in our surveys, we asked your clients about any timeline they've heard of where you're replacing your backend payroll processing and tax filing engine, something you talked about last fall. Only 5% were aware of it. I'm curious if you have a timeline to introduce the new backend payroll and tax filing engines, and if so what is that? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: So, the good news is that both of those are actually in production and have pilot clients on them. As we've said I think on a number of occasions, these are back-office systems that are relatively transparent to our clients. In fact, today, our clients don't really have direct contact with our gross-to-net calculation engine and we don't expect them to have that in the future. Now, there will be \u2013 the reason we're doing it is, besides the obvious reasons of modern technology being easier to develop on, faster to develop and cheaper to maintain, there will be some enhancements from a client-facing perspective and from an associate service client perspective. But largely, you should think of these as back-office infrastructure that is really not \u2013 when someone is trying to hire someone or manage their human capital at their company, typically this is not something that they would be exposed to or that would be transparent to them. Certainly, the employees of our clients won't see any change at all. Our Mobile Solutions are frontend solutions that will be connected back to our new gross-to-net engines. So, I would say, it's mostly positive and we don't expect \u2013 I guess, the key is that there's really no, I guess, migration, if you will. We're not going to be sitting here talking about \u2013 there will be efforts and costs around the connections to our frontend HCM systems, but there really is no \"client migration\" that you should be anticipating. And I think I would also add that despite what you might hear from competitors, almost everyone operates with a gross-to-net calc engine that is even if it's in a single-stack technology, it is almost always separate from the frontend HCM platforms as well. So, it's really not \u2013 what we're doing is no different than what anybody else would have out there, it's just more on modern stack technology. I think I don't know if you mentioned Lifion, but our kind of low-code platform that we're developing that we've talked about now publicly, that is not a back-office system, that is definitely a front-office facing system, and we do have a number of pilot clients on that as well. And we'll talk more about all of these platforms in the future and their impact on the organization in a positive way at our Investor Day in June. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI : Understood. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks so much. I wanted to ask on the mid-market conversion being done, is it reasonable to expect an improvement in retention from here in your mid-market segment? And I'm curious, does completing the migration also trigger a measurable cost savings from retiring the old platforms? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: We are hoping for a continued improvement of retention as there has been clearly impact for clients that had to be migrated, and made choices and decisions to either follow us on that path or not. And so, there should be continued improvement. I don't know if the trend will change in a huge way because we had now, I would say, probably six or seven quarters of improving retention in the mid-market. And so, it should be in the long-term continued improvement because the newer strategic platforms had higher retention rates, and so our plans call for it. But the migration-related impact for \u2013 now behind us, long-term, yes. In the short-term, there's no immediate major cost savings for shutting down here and there system, but everything is kind of more a smooth path of continued progress. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah. I think cost \u2013 we said this before, when we shut down our down-market platform, this was several years ago, we migrated all of our clients on to RUN. The cost savings from a technical standpoint were in the, call it, sub-$10 million range from a pure platform support standpoint, et cetera. But as you can see from the performance of that business, we haven't talked about the down-market yet, but the down-market just continues to be incredibly successful and a great story for us. And the reality is that the direct cost focus is really not where the money is. The money is in improved client satisfaction, improved retention, accelerated new business bookings, and then just frictional cost in the organization around implementation and service. And so, having said all that, we expect a similar story in the mid-market, but obviously, we just finished like the last client I think last week. And so, it'll probably take \u2013 in the down-market as an example, we kind of laid the foundation like we've just laid in the mid-market and it took several quarters if not a year or two before we got real traction, and it was a really great story. And we really hope that we have a repeat of that story, but as Jan said, we have to be cautious because we have to go execute. But this quarter, like all other \u2013 like the last several quarters, the retention of our strategic platform in mid-market was higher than the legacy platform that was being retired. But I think what Jan is alluding to is you had two competing forces. One is we had fewer and fewer migrations which was helping the retention rate, but they just also were executing better. They've had many, many quarters in the last \u2013 I think in six or seven quarters where retention was moving in the right direction, despite six quarters ago or five quarters ago still very, very heavy migrations in the mid-market. So, hard to tell here exactly what's going to happen, but we're very optimistic. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Now, we'll consider all that. And then just my quick follow-up on the PEO side with the unit growth breaking below double-digit, is this a sales issue or a secular issue in the 50 and up market for PEO? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think in the short-term, it's fair to say that it's probably a sales issue, a new business bookings issue. So, I don't think there's really any kind of secular trend. As I think Jan mentioned, we had very, very strong growth and demand still in the down-market under 50, and then this quarter we struggled a little bit in terms of particularly in new business bookings in the mid-market of PEO, if you will. And we're kind of watching that closely. We're kind of looking back at our incentives because, as you know, a lot of the business that we have in our PEO is driven from referrals of our other business units. And so, we have ways of tweaking and adjusting incentives and so forth. But we're frankly pretty \u2013 we're never thrilled with a deceleration, we always prefer acceleration. But our PEO is very large, it's the second employer in the United States now, and I think this growth I think is still \u2013 in terms of absolute worksite employee growth in dollars still more than any of our competitors. And so, we feel pretty proud of that. And I think the percentage is obviously one way to look at it, but when you look at absolute size in dollars, we feel like we have a really good strong business here and it's performing very well. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Agreed. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from David Grossman of Stifel. Your line is open. David Michael Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. So, Carlos, I think even with the very strong 3Q bookings result, you still need an uptick in 4Q to hit the target for the year. And I think you mentioned the investment and sales head count in the fourth quarter last year is another favorable comp. But is there any way to parse out those factors that you can share? Any other metrics that can help us understand the underlying momentum in the core business? I'm just trying to kind of parse out the impact of sales execution versus product and service. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think as you're alluding to I think they all have an impact, so it's hard scientifically to kind point to any one single item. But for sure the investments and sales that we made, call it last year, as time goes on those could become more and more productive. Every quarter our sales force is \u2013 when we add new people in a step change fashion, become more and more productive. So, I think that's helpful. I think our products are stronger and I think that is helping as well. The comparisons always help, because we're very large and we have a very large new business bookings number. And so, I think the compares have an impact as well. So, I don't know if Jan has any other color, but I think it's probably a number of things, but we're very happy that our productivity as we expected from some of the sales force investments is driving frankly a good portion of our new business bookings growth which is very nice to see. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I can add maybe a number to it David that might help you a little bit. Last year, we grew our head count in our sales force 9% and we are currently at about 3%. So, a large chunk of the growth that Carlos refers to is driven by productivity or new product, productivity being the largest one. We have talked in our last year's investor presentations about our sales channel, sales strategies that we are expanding which are strong focus on expanding our channel strategy. And so, we continue to see, for example, great success with our accountant channel strategy in the mid-market. We are building out an continued success in our inside sales strategy that sells supplemental products to our clients, and that's where we have very predictable and very pleasing results relative to productivity improvement. Those were new associates that came on last year and now they're gaining productivity, and it's a law of large numbers that really executed well. In addition, a component that we haven't talked on a regular basis and doing our investor presentations is our target to drive accelerated new logo growth versus AB (00:41:41). So, historically, we have kind of a balanced mix between 50%/50% relative to new business bookings comprised of being new business bookings driven by new clients, about half of them, and 50% by selling additional product to existing clients. And we have seen now, in addition to this growth that we experienced also a shift to more new logo sales. And it's now more than 60% of our new business bookings have come from new logos, which is a really great complement to the sales force, because we believe being competitive and winning new clients to ADP is a great testament to the competitive of our product set and the capability of the sales force. David Michael Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks for that. Very helpful. And just one quick follow-up just on the question about the new products that are being developed, the low code platform and the next-gen processing engine. I know you said you're going to give more at the Investor Day, however can you give us a quick update on what are the key problems that the new platforms solve? And that's whether it's more cost to maintain internally or they're competitive kind of holes that it drills, just trying to get a sense on how to frame kind of the new product introductions and the impact on the business. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Again, we can obviously talk for a long time about that, but I'll just give you two broad themes. One is, I think you ended your question on is it partly competitive and the beginning of your question was really around does it address kind of cost of development and maintenance and so forth, I think those are the two broad categories. In each of these cases with the exception of maybe the tax at the backend, the tax engine, but certainly our new gross-to-net processing engine and our low code platform are all intended to leapfrog the competition in terms of capabilities and flexibility for clients, in terms of how people get managed and how people get paid. And then besides that obviously our business case had very strong expectations around efficiency, I think productivity, and just removing frictional costs that exist as a result of some legacy technology. And obviously, I think you said it also the speed of development, the speed of deployment, and ability to implement changes in a version-less environment is also incredibly powerful. David Michael Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot. I wanted to go back on kind of the bookings and you've highlighted new drivers, including sales force and that kind of thing. I'm wondering if you can rank order kind of what you think are the contributors from directly where ADP has control on things like sales force versus what's happening perhaps in the economy or in the market as a whole. And it seems like you've talked about retention as being separate factors, but are there any common threads maybe that we can draw between the strong bookings and better retention? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think that you're onto something that most of us and most people are not onto, which is there's a belief among some of us who have been around for a while that they are very, very closely linked. The momentum, when you have strong momentum in the business, improving satisfaction, improving NPS, improving retention, it has to \u2013 the thing is we just don't have any empirical way of drawing the connection, but experience and intuition I think would tell you that there's no question, because we've seen it go the other way as well. So, I think that the company is just experiencing strong momentum on a number of fronts around execution, client service, client satisfaction, et cetera, and that's probably creating a little bit of a halo effect. But from a practical standpoint, if you rank order the sales execution issues, I think the item that Jan brought up is probably the most important one. We talked about, I'd say, probably six quarters ago or four quarters ago when we ran into the very difficult compares of ACA and a new administration that was at least less openly focused on regulation. We talked about having to really refocus our sales force on new logos and on really selling what is now obviously an incredible opportunity to help people manage a very difficult labor environment with tightened labor markets. You saw our National Employment Report today, and it's obviously consistent with the government reports that it's getting hard, so definitely a war for talent on again. So, we were optimistic and hopeful that there was really good opportunity for our sales force to retool and drive new business bookings in a different way, and that's exactly what they've done. Some of it has been through training, some of it has been through product, and some of it has been through incentives. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. And then just a quick question is, as you've had a chance to digest the change in tax law, et cetera, should we expect there \u2013 what should we expect for opportunities for further improvement in tax rate, et cetera, going forward? Thanks. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah. The outlook that I gave of 26% to \u2013 what did I say, 25% to 26% beyond 2018, that excludes the onetime items that we typically hunt in our tax reduction efforts, and those opportunities have gotten a little bit fewer as the overall rates have come down and we have less differential between international and the U.S. So, I think the 25% to 26% is a good number. We'll clearly work as good as we can, but that's really an honest forecast of what we're anticipating. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you our next question is from Jeff Silber of BMO. Your line is open. Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey. Good morning. It's Henry Chien calling in for Jeff. Just wanted to follow-up on the bookings question and sort of the improvement that you're seeing in sales and bookings, can you comment a little bit on how much of that you could say is related to competition versus some of the cloud software providers, and if \u2013 are those kind of players still having an impact? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Well, we have a lot of competitors in every segment. When we look at the kind of net win/loss ratios, if you will, how many clients we take away from competitors versus how many they take from us, we've seen some improvement in some areas, and then there's a couple that are still difficult. I think that's \u2013 those are figures that are also that are somewhat not volatile quarter to quarter, but it changes depending on how strong we are in a particular segment versus one of our competitors. But I'd say, we're overall pretty happy about our competitive position, and it seems obvious that it feels like it's improving, but I think that's about as much color as I can give or should give without crossing the line, because we try to be diplomatic about our comments around our competitors. Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Maybe it's fair to say that the competitive environment in this quarter has not meaningfully changed to other quarters. It remains highly competitive. Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah. Got it. Okay. Fair enough. And on the down-market and some of the improvement that you're seeing there, is that mostly from a product standpoint or some of the sales efforts that you mentioned with new logos? Just trying to think of how should we think about that. Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: The performance in our down-market is probably the best execution in performance I've seen in my career at ADP, and it's back to an earlier question about connecting it to client retention and other things, there are just so many things that are creating the positive momentum that it's hard to really focus on one specific one. So, as an example, we consider our down-market business to be not just our payroll and HR services for smaller companies, but we also have a Retirement Services business and we have an Insurance Services business that are just really across the board just executing incredibly well, strong double-digit new business bookings growth, strong retention. Our retention in our down-market, for example, is up several hundred basis points over where it was several years ago on a consistent quarter to quarter basis. And of course that helps with the growth, because you don't have to sell as much in order to drive the top line revenue growth, because you're losing less clients. And so, the continuing strength of the new business bookings with the improving fundamentals of that business are just driving really great results, and I think it's just across the board just outstanding execution by all the leaders in those businesses. Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. That's great to hear. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from James Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe return to the new bookings detail that you provided earlier. I think you called out strengths in the down-market and also some strength in international. Can you maybe talk about what was driving that, but also touch on what you saw in the mid-market bookings? And whether you think that after the platform transition \u2013 with that now complete, whether that can improve in the coming quarters? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah. I can give Carlos a little break here. Part of the good news about the new business bookings is that we saw really meaningful improvement across all channels across the board. So, it was not focused only on the down-market. The down-market had a good performance and continue to do it, but it was really mid-market, up-market, international, they all contributed to growth in the new business bookings quarter if you look by each of the channels basically that we have. So, the broad-based, and in the mid-market, there's really on the sales process not a change, and the migrations haven't really affected in a sense the product offering in the mid-market. We have been selling Workforce Now current version, our cloud-based leading product, and that has been very competitive and continues to do well in the mid-market. So, it's hard to point really in the quarter a particular stand out, because the performance was really solid across all segments, Jim. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I will say that in the mid-market as an example, this happened a little bit in the down-market also when we were doing the migrations of our legacy technology, our sales force does sometimes get distracted when an existing client still has a relationship with a sales rep and they call the sales rep, because they're being told they have to migrate to a new platform, and there's that distraction. Now, sometimes that historically provided opportunities also for our sales force to sell additional products as a client was migrating to the new platform. So, there's puts and takes, but it's going to be a lot less distraction, that's for sure. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's helpful color. And then maybe just as a follow-up to the point you just made, Carlos, I would have normally expected that there could have been a little bit of a risk to the retention metrics in the mid-market as you complete that transition. Obviously, that didn't happen. So, can you maybe give us a sense about like what tactics you may have used to kind of keep those retention numbers up in the mid-market? And whether you think those can be kind of more broadly applicable across the board? Is it service continuity, realignment or something else? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think the tactic was smart, dedicated people who were very creative. And so, as we kind of came out of some of the big challenges we had when we had to accelerate in a very large and meaningful way our migrations due to ACA, because our ACA products were only available on our new platform, I think what that taught us was when you think about the lifetime value of these clients using what they called a white-glove service approach to the migrations really made the difference in terms of not having the losses be as big as they could've been. We clearly experienced heavier losses in the legacy platform because I just mentioned that our retention rates are higher in our current version platform than in our legacy platform, but they could've been a lot worse. And so, I think it was just great execution, great commitment, and good creativity around frankly just swarming those transitioning clients with a white-glove service in order to try to minimize the negative impact of the migrations and it really did work. So, hats off to the leaders there. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good to hear. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Marcon of R.W. Baird. Your line is open. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Just wondering if you could just provide a little bit more color with regards to the source of the new logos? Specifically what I'm wondering is, are you seeing an expansion of new logos that maybe coming not necessarily from traditional competitors, but maybe some other players that are out there? How would you characterize some of the new logos? And then I have a follow-up. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Again, just because I hate to be a broken record, but when we look at both our losses and also our new logos, we are so broad-based and we have so many competitors that \u2013 I think I've said this before that there's really a couple competitors, for example, who in the up-market come close to maybe 10% of our losses, but nobody is really kind of that meaningful, and I think it's even more true in the mid-market that there isn't one specific competitor that accounts for a great deal of our losses. And then, it's the same thing with new business bookings. But I think it's safe to say that some of that stuff is related to market share. And so, our biggest competitors generally speaking would be ones where we would lose the most clients to, but also we have a lot of success in pulling clients. That obviously varies by segment, but I think directionally that's true, and the difference maker in each case is really the execution of the sales force. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then with regards to nationals, there have been some discussion about expanding your push with Workforce Now up there. Can you talk a little bit about that and what you're seeing on Workforce Now internationals versus Vantage? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah. We had the Workforce Now product being offered I think for the last two years now in the up-market, and the new logo growth that Workforce Now for clients above 1,000 is incremental to new logo growth that Vantage continues to achieve. So, the combination of both of them has helped our broad-based acceleration of new logo growth. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: And we definitely \u2013 I think it has been something that we had available and it's helped us compete in kind of the low end of the up-market for a few years. But I think it's safe to say in the last year or so, we kind of doubled-down a little bit, and put more focus and more emphasis, and I think it's having the desired impact. Like our \u2013 and there are a few competitors in particular where Workforce Now lines up very, very strongly in the lower end of the up-market and I think that strategy is working. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Matt O'Neill of Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Matt C. O'Neill - Autonomous Research US LP : Yes. Thank you. All my questions have been asked and answered. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude our Q&A session for today. I'd like to turn the program over to Mr. Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: So, just a couple of final comments, I terms of looking at the \u2013 obviously, we've had a lot of achievements this year and we're pretty happy about the momentum we have, and I think it demonstrates the strong culture that we have at ADP and it's one that we're not afraid to change, but we want to do so in a thoughtful, orderly and balanced way. With these migrations done in the mid-market and the progress we're making with our Service Alignment initiatives and the early retirement program, among some of the other initiatives that you'll hear more about at the June Investor Day, I just want to again reemphasize how proud I am of our associates and all of these efforts of the things they're doing to really protect and enhance the value of ADP. I also want to make sure I mention that besides the dividend increase, which I think is great news for shareholders from a governance standpoint, we did add two new board members who bring a lot of experience, both operationally and transformationally to our board. And I look forward and I know the rest of the board looks forward to working with them as we build a brighter future for ADP. And with that, I'll thank you for joining us and we look forward to seeing you at our Investor Day in June. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Call. Thank you. I will turn the conference over to Mr. Christian Greyenbuhl, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Christian Greyenbuhl - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you, Christy, and good morning everyone. This is Christian Greyenbuhl, ADP's Vice President, Investor Relations, and I'm here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call and webcast. During our call today, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors, and that exclude the impact of certain items in the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2018 as well as the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2017. A description of these items and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found in this morning's press release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. I would also like to note that as we outlined and during our recent Investor Day, beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we will be making some changes to our disclosures and reporting. You will find an explanation of the changes in the financial outlook and additional material sections of our Investor Day presentation. Accordingly, our fiscal 2019 outlook reflects these changes and to ensure comparability includes all the necessary adjustments to fiscal 2018 results. For the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2018, our results and related discussion do not reflect these changes and are therefore on the same basis of presentation as our previous quarters. We recognize the complexity of this transition and therefore to bridge the two we have included select fiscal 2018 pro forma financials and metrics in the appendix to our earnings presentation found on our Investor Relations website. As always please do not hesitate to reach out should you have any questions regarding these new metrics and disclosures. Now let me turn the call over to Carlos. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you, Christian. Good morning, everyone. This morning we reported our fourth quarter fiscal 2018 results with revenue of $3.3 billion, up 8% reported and 6% organic constant currency. We ended the year with total revenue of $13.3 billion, up 8% reported and 6% organic constant currency. We're very happy to report our new business bookings grew 18% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the year, both ahead of our expectations. We saw strong performance across all of our businesses this quarter which we believe serves as further validation of the renewed momentum within our salesforce following fiscal 2017. We were also pleased to see our new logo strategy continue to show results with double digit new client growth this quarter and nearly double digit growth for the full year. Now let me spend a few moments on the recent performance of our PEO. Revenues for the year grew 12%, in line with our expectations, while average worksite employees grew 9% to 504,000. After a softer third quarter bookings and retention performance, we took certain actions to address our internal lead flows that we believe will help drive the reacceleration next year and we are pleased to see positive signs of this working this quarter with double digit bookings growth and solid double digit new logo growth. Similar to last quarter, our PEO bookings and retention were strong in the down market, while we continue to see some pressure from larger client losses in the mid market. However, our competitive position remains strong and the volatility in our mid market retention is not new and follows a record high retention in fiscal 2017. We have previously outlined the volatility of retention within the PEO and particularly the impact of the timing of larger client losses. As we work to overcome some of these challenges from the second half of fiscal 2018, we continue to believe that the PEO represents a significant opportunity for us. With nearly $1 billion of revenues excluding pass-throughs and very healthy margins, we remain excited about the future of the PEO. Now I'd like to focus on the strong progress of our investments to improve the client experience. With our mid market migrations behind us and our Service Alignment Initiative nearing completion, we are happy to see a continued overall improvement in our client satisfaction scores this quarter. In particular, we were very happy to see our mid market scores return back to levels last seen in early fiscal 2015 and we are confident our recent service initiatives will help drive continued improvements across our entire portfolio. Our Employer Services revenue retention for the quarter and for the full year were both in line with expectations. As you know, on a quarterly basis this metric can be volatile and this quarter we saw a decline of 120 basis points. However, more importantly, for the full year, we were pleased to see continued positive year-over-year momentum as our overall annual retention increased by 50 basis points to 90.4% and continues to benefit from the improvements in client satisfaction that I just outlined. Going forward, we will be guiding to annual retention and Jan will take you through some of these changes later. In early June, we hosted an Investor Day where we discussed in detail our strategic vision, transformation initiatives and financial outlook for the next three years. We received a lot of positive feedback. And for those of you who may have missed it or would like to revisit it, the materials and the video replay have been posted to our Investor Relations website. Our goal for the event was to outline our plans for driving sustainable long-term profitable growth and provide a deep dive into our product strategy and the actions we have been taking to accelerate our transformation initiatives. Through our investments in products, service and distribution we will continue to build on our momentum. We are shaping the HCM industry through organic innovations such as our next-gen platforms as well as our strategic acquisitions, such as Global Cash Card and WorkMarket. Our leading position in the global HCM market continues to represent a significant opportunity for us. And earlier today, we were proud to announce the acquisition Celergo a respected provider of international payroll management services. Celergo complements and augments our current multinational offerings through the combination of a proprietary cloud-based platform and a broad local partner network across 150 countries and we couldn't be more excited. With these investments, we are expanding on our position as the only global HCM provider that can help businesses address their full hire to retire needs across their entire workforce be that traditional or freelance. We also continue to engage with a number of key partners including our recent partnership with Microsoft to bring together Workforce Now and Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central and innovators like Slack and ZipRecruiter. As the world of work continues to evolve rapidly, we continue to focus on staying ahead of the curve. Last quarter, with the assistance of the Transformation Office, we finalized plans for our voluntary early retirement program. We were pleased to start fiscal 2019 through a successfully managed first wave of transitions and we remain focused on executing this initiative in an orderly and timely manner. As a result, we recognized a non-GAAP charge of $337 million in the fourth quarter and anticipate annualized pre-tax savings of approximately $150 million with about two-thirds of the anticipated benefit expected in fiscal 2019. All this growth and success would not be possible without the hard work and dedication of our associates, who continue to be an integral part of our efforts to drive change and ensure our successful transformation. And with that, I'll turn over the call to Jan for his commentary on the fourth quarter results and fiscal 2019 outlook. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you, Carlos, and good morning everyone. As Carlos mentioned, we finished the year with solid momentum, driven by better than expected consolidated new business bookings growth of 8% to $1.8 billion for fiscal year 2018. ADP's reported revenues also continued to show improvements relative to our expectations and grew 8% in fiscal year 2018, or 6% organic constant currency, supported by our continued improvement in our Employer Services retention. On a reported basis, earnings before income taxes decreased 14%, while our adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or adjusted EBIT, increased 8% including approximately 1 point lift from FX and 1 point of pressure from the impact of our fiscal year 2018 acquisitions. Adjusted EBIT margin was up about 10 basis points compared to fiscal year 2017 and was slightly above expectations covered at our Investor Day despite higher selling expenses due to the strong bookings performance. While we're also being well ahead of our original expectations set at the beginning of the year, our performance benefited from continued improvements in our infrastructure and sales spend and from the successful execution of certain transformation initiatives that we outlined during our Investor Day. We achieved all of this while also overcoming about 30 basis points of pressure from our fiscal year 2018 acquisitions. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 18% to $4.35. And in addition to our revenue and margin performance was aided by a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the year was 26.1% and benefited from corporate tax reform. In addition to delivering this solid operating performance, we have paid about $1.1 billion in dividends and returned about $1 billion through share repurchases for fiscal year 2018. Let me now take you through our segment results. In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 5% for the year, 4% organic constant currency, in line with expectations. Our same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.7% for the fiscal year. Average client fund balances grew 6% compared to a year ago. This growth was driven by a combination of wage inflation and growth in our pays per control offset by pressure from lower state unemployment insurance collections and corporate tax reform. Outside North America, our solutions have continued to perform well, largely helped by the continued strong performance of our multinational solutions, which serve businesses of all sizes. Employer Services margin increased about 10 points for the fiscal year and included approximately 40 basis points of pressure from the impact of acquisitions. PEO revenues grew 12% for the year with average worksite employees growing 9% to 504,000 employees. Following the slowdown last quarter in the 50 employee and above market, we were pleased to see some recovery in our PEO new business bookings as we started to take certain actions during the fourth quarter. The PEO segment margins increased 10 basis points for the year. Overall, we generated significant momentum over the course of the year. The actions that we're taking have helped us to expand our margins, leading to better than expected performance in fiscal year 2018 despite some incremental pressure from our recent acquisitions. And more importantly, we continue to make important investments into our business to set us up for the future. Let us now move to our fiscal year 2019 outlook. As a reminder, my discussions of our results for fiscal year 2018 was on the same basis of accounting as our previous quarters. In contrast, our fiscal year 2019 outlook includes the expected impacts of ASC 606 for both fiscal years 2019 and 2018 as well as the expected impact from certain other adjustments we outlined for you earlier. As you look to adjust your models, you should find all the necessary details in the appendix of our quarterly presentation and in our earnings release, which both are available on our Investor Relations website. With that said, I'll first provide our consolidated fiscal year 2019 outlook and then focus on the segments with some added color on some of the more nuanced changes. We anticipate total revenue growth of 5% to 7% for fiscal year 2019. We expect adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 100 to 125 basis points including approximately 20 basis points of pressure from acquisitions. And as you can see from this morning's press release and the appendix of our investor presentation, this margin expansion would have been about 30 basis points higher on an ASC 605 basis. We expect an effective tax rate, an adjusted effective tax rate of 25.1% in fiscal year 2019 as compared to our prior estimated adjusted effective tax rate of 25% to 26%. All of this drives anticipated growth of adjusted diluted earnings per share of 13% to 15% compared with the $4.53 in fiscal year 2018. Similar to our margin expansion, this growth would have been higher on an ASC 605 basis for about 2%. Regarding shareholders' distribution, as usual it remains our intent to continue our return of excess cash to shareholders subject to market conditions. Now for some more detail in the segments. We expect 4% to 6% revenue growth in our Employer Services segment, which includes anticipated pays per control growth of about 2.5% and now benefits from growth in interest income at actual rates, reflecting one of the changes we made to our segment reporting. We expect Employer Services new business bookings growth of 6% to 8% as we continue to build positive momentum from our investments and head count while driving improvements in productivity from our product and channel strategies. This new metric is specific to the Employer Services segment and we hope that as you also use the materials from our Investor Day, that will help you with your models. You will recall that this is a shift from our prior worldwide new business bookings guidance which included sales for the PEO segment. To further help you with your model, we have given you some historical quarterly growth comparison within this morning's earnings schedules. Let's now move to the Employer Services revenue retention. As Carlos mentioned, our Employer Services revenue retention for fiscal year 2019 was 90.4%. For fiscal year 2019, we are expecting our revenue retention to increase about 25 to 50 basis points compared to the 90.4%, driven in part by expected improvement in our mid and up market supported by the completion of our mid market migrations a few months ago. Since this is the first time we are guiding to retention, I'll provide a little extra color. We generally have several months of visibilities for clients leaving in the mid and up market and less direct visibility in the down market as clients do not provide such much notice. In addition to this direct visibility, we look at trends in our NPS scores as a leading indicator. And that helps us directionally anticipate where retention is heading. Also, because our service teams work closely with our clients, we monitor various other metrics and operating statistics that we try to leverage when forecasting our anticipated losses. Lastly, there is some mix impact to retention over time as our different products can have very different retention rates because of the market segment characteristics. And so we've taken into account our anticipated revenue growth in these various offerings. All this is to say that we have generally some visibility on where retention will end up for the year. But given the breadth of markets and clients that we serve, certain factors can ultimately move the needle, particularly the timing of larger losses. We expect margin in our ES segment to expand by 150 to 175 basis points inclusive of 30 basis points of acquisition drag. And by the way of comparison, the impact of adopting ASC 606 to our ES margin expansion exceeds the 30 basis points impact on the ADP's consolidated margin expansion. Our margin continues to benefit from a combination of operating leverage as well as some of the discrete initiatives that we spoke about at our Investor Day. For example, our voluntary early retirement program will be a key contributor this year, and as we expect minimal dual operation expenses related to our Service Alignment Initiatives in fiscal year 2019. With that said, let's now touch on the PEO, which also includes a number of moving pieces. We expect 7% to 9% PEO revenue growth in fiscal year 2019 driven by 7% to 8% growth in average worksite employees. As Carlos mentioned, we saw progress in our PEO bookings this quarter and we have continued to make certain additional targeted adjustments to our PEO distribution process. We believe this will help drive a gradual reacceleration in worksite employee growth. We also anticipate 5% to 7% growth in PEO revenues excluding zero margin healthcare benefit pass-throughs. This too is a new revenue disclosure that we discussed at our Investor Day. And I want to remind you that it does include revenues from workers' compensation and state unemployment insurance premiums. As you might infer from our guidance, we expect some drag next year from lower workers' compensation and SUI rates, which impacts our revenue, but it's ultimately positive development for our clients and for our PEO prospects. For PEO margin, we expect 75 to 50 basis points of margin decrease. Among the changes we made to our segments is the inclusion of ADP Indemnity into the PEO segment earnings, which we believe enhances our disclosures. As a reminder, ADP indemnity is our captive workers' compensation insurer and there is also which used to be accounted for in the other segment. Including Indemnity into the PEO segment adds no revenues, but does impact margins. ADP Indemnity uses a third-party actuary to assist with the loss reserve estimation process and changes in the assessment of workers' compensation loss reserves may at times introduce a little bit of noise to the PEO margins now that is included in our segment results. More specifically, as we regularly adjust our loss revenue estimates, we have realized some P&L benefits over the last few years including fiscal year 2018. However, we typically do not forecast any material change to these reserves going into a fiscal year. And as a result for fiscal year 2019, this results in more than 75 basis points of anticipated grow over pressure for the PEO segment margins. Excluding this grow over pressure, we would have otherwise expect to our margins to be slightly positive. Moving on to the remainder of our outlook. We expect interest on client funds to increase approximately $80 million to $90 million driven by higher rates and anticipated client fund balance growth of 3% to 4%. We expect our total impact from the client funds extended investment strategy to be up about $60 million to $70 million. The details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. Overall, I think you can tell we are happy with our performance and with the momentum that we are building from our investments in the business. At our Investor Day, we set margin and EPS target ranges throughout fiscal year 2021. And we will continue to execute towards these goals with fiscal year 2019 being a step in the right direction. So with that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will take our first question from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe comment on the retention decline you saw in the quarter. Clearly, as you got to the end of the mid market transition, we would have expected some impact there. But can you maybe point out other areas of the business that might have seen a little bit of pressure there? Or was it purely in the mid market ES part? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: We feel still pretty good about our momentum when you look across the different businesses with retention and you look at our client satisfaction scores. And as usual, there was some noise from a couple of large losses. So we did have in particular a large loss in what we call our comp solutions business which really provides standalone services. So there was a company that we were providing standalone services to that was a relatively large revenue loss. And that had an impact on the numbers. So I guess it's the old story, this happens every several quarters that we have one or two large losses that may move the needle and I think that's what happened this quarter. Because we still feel pretty good. In full transparency, our mid market retention actually was pretty good. And it's because we did finish the migration. So even though we had some losses towards the end of the migrations there were still, in relation to the size of the business, there were few enough left that even though we lost some at the end, we still now are seeing what we were hoping to see, which is our strategic platform has higher retention rates and as the amount of business on the old platform goes to zero, you see the math just works in your favor. And so I think we have nothing but positive things to report about our mid market retention in the fourth quarter. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's helpful color. Thank you. And then maybe looking forward in terms of the new business bookings outlook, can you maybe talk about some of the products where you're seeing the most traction? And specifically, as we think about the cadence of bookings through the year, is it fair to say there's a little bit more weighting in the first half of the year versus the second half of the year relative to your outlook? Or any color on that would be helpful. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I can take the sales outlook. As we indicated, the momentum that we experienced on new business bookings for the fourth quarter was very broad based really across all market segments and good momentum for a lot of products. So the overall forecast that we have for our salesforce continues to be that all business units will experience good growth, solid healthy growth. Maybe a little bit more strength in the down market, but overall I would say a very balanced portfolio. And we do have a little bit of selling season but the quarters are actually fairly balanced. It's like different market segments have different selling seasons. And we experience at times at year-end a big push towards the end which has to do with our incentive systems I believe, but nothing unusual relative to our sales distribution effort. But we're feeling really good. Well staffed. Salesforce is excited about the core products and is excited about the product additions that we have brought through acquisitions to the table. So we're confident about sales. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah. And adding just to Jan's comment, I always worry when we have the strong finish as Jan was alluding to. We typically have incentives that drive very strong performance towards the end. That tends to happen to be magnified when you already are having a very strong year. And I think we had definitely a good year. But as you know the first half was still a challenge for us and it was really in the third quarter where we really kind of picked up the momentum. And then in the fourth quarter that momentum accelerated. So we did have a strong finish. I think people were racing towards those accelerators. But again, this is more art than science in terms of trying to get a feel for kind of where we are. But I would echo Jan's comment that we're feeling pretty good at least for about the start. The momentum carrying into the first quarter is I think good. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC : Thank you. Good morning. Could you talk about some of the initiatives in the PEO business to accelerate lead flow and bookings growth? And then in connection with that, what do you see as the main drivers for the weakness in the first place? Is this more of a competitive issue, or are all these within your own control? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: We looked at the balance of trade numbers to really see if there's any kind of competitive issues and we didn't see anything there throughout the whole year. So we then, I think it was probably after the first half I started looking back to see, is there something typically when you don't see any issues that are competitive or the economy or otherwise, there's usually, in my experience at ADP and taught to me by my predecessors is, there is usually something around our incentives internally. Because as you know, whether it's in the PEO or other parts of our business, our incentives are quite aligned to drive business to our most profitable, highest revenue sources which are the PEO. And we get I think it's about 50% of our business from internally generated leads. So that system of incentives and lead flow is very, very important. And we did make some changes that, I'm ashamed to say I wasn't 100% aware of that I think created a distraction, let's just say, to lead flow particularly for mid market clients into the PEO. So we readjusted those incentives. I believe it was in the third quarter, towards the end of the third quarter of this fiscal year and we already saw in the fourth quarter double digit growth in bookings in the PEO. And we don't want to split it in terms of how much was up market and down market. But we had, suffice to say, we had strong double digit sales growth and bookings growth in the PEO and the mid market contributed to that without getting too specific. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Maybe, David, one other pointer is that the unit growth of new business bookings into the PEO actually accelerated meaningfully and it was in the high double digits, in the high teens, and which means we had really an overall acceleration of deal flow, which bodes well for competitiveness. It just happened to be that we had to fix this mid market situation. So that bodes I think overall well. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah, I think Jan's comment about double digit unit growth is for the full year. It's in addition to my comment about the fourth quarter. I think it's another triangulation to get to the conclusion. Right now, our conclusion is that there is no competitive issue. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC : Understood. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up. What is your expectation for FY 2019 in the PEO for workers' compensation reserve treatment? I mean, would you expect reserves to go up, to go down? And what impact on earnings will that have versus what you saw in FY 2018? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: So a couple of just points in terms from a historical perspective. We started using reinsurance. As you know, we disclose all of this in our 10-K. So the amount of reserves that we have is related to years back between, I believe it's 2004 and 2012, if I'm not mistaken, or 2013. From that point forward, we have less volatility even though there is some risk sharing collar, if you will, but it's very relatively limited. So this issue about reserves is historical. But we have seen fortunately overall positive development in the last several years. And so this is not the first year, in 2018, where we've had a benefit from, or what we would call release of reserves if you will. Now some of that is related to possibly the economy. It could be related to healthcare. There is a lot of things that go in. Workers' compensation is a long-tail insurance. And so there is quite a bit of volatility in those numbers themselves. But we've consistently over the last four years had benefits if you will. In 2018, it was a particularly large benefit, which is why Jan was in his comments explaining that we have a grow over issue. We don't, as you can imagine, we can't plan for the release of workers' compensation reserves, because that has to do with actuarial work that gets done. It actually gets done on a quarterly basis and we adjust those reserves on a quarterly basis. But if we continue to have favorable loss development, which is what causes the release of these reserves, we should have some benefit in 2019. We just don't believe that it could be as large as it was in 2019 and don't at least have that planned currently. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC : Just a quick final. What was the EPS benefit in 2018 from the reserve release? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: It's really not that \u2013 it's not significant enough to \u2013 we had lots of other things that were of similar size. Like for example, we, to go in the other direction. So we had acquisition drag. We had our migrations expense went up by almost $20 million for the year. So the issue is that since we have segment reporting, we're giving you margins at the segment level and we're increasing our disclosure. We're just giving you a lot of extra color. But we weren't trying to imply that we made our numbers or that our EPS was driven by the reserves. It just happens to be that because of the size of the PEO, when you exclude pass-throughs in the PEO and you look at that margin, it's a large business but the release of those reserves I think can impact those margins from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year. But you shouldn't read \u2013 don't read anything more into it other than at the segment level, which is what we're trying to give you color on. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America. Your line is open. Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks guys. Good morning. I just wanted to come back on PEO, because it seems like for fiscal 2019 that's where there's some delta between what the Street was looking for and what you're guiding to. So there's some deceleration baked in here obviously relative to fiscal 2018 growth levels. Can you just walk us through the pieces there? Because your qualitative commentary actually sounds more upbeat in terms of some of the newfound bookings momentum in PEO. But obviously the revenue guide to 7% to 9%. So just explain to us the pieces of deceleration that seem to be embedded in the guide there. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah well, I think there a couple of different pieces. One is the momentum in terms of underlying worksite employee growth which I think we've been talking about it for the last \u2013 we talked about it the last quarter. I think it was also a focus item. You guys had a question about it then and again, no different than the rest of our recurring revenue businesses. If we believe that, and we do believe that we're optimistic about next year around new business bookings and retention. It's not something that turns around in July or in August. It's a gradual lift back up over the course of the year. So I think some of it is just the core slowdown in worksite employee growth which has gone from somewhere in the low teens to 9%, I think is what we just said when we ended the year. So that's one factor. And then the other factor, which is actually more significant if you're focused on top line growth, which I would be careful about doing in the PEO, is what happens with pass-throughs. And so as Jan was alluding to, we have an issue with workers' compensation and SUI rates coming down which is frankly a huge positive for us. From a selling standpoint, it's a positive for our clients. It's a positive for retention, but that puts pressure on revenues. And then the biggest factor really is benefits. When you look at top line overall revenue in the PEO, we've had years, particularly as ACA was starting to kick in in the early years of the Affordable Care Act, we had higher participation rates in benefits. So you had not only inflation of benefit rates, but you had higher participation of benefits. And by participation, we mean the number of worksite employees, the percentage of worksite employees taking benefits. So that was adding and actually putting downward pressure on margins, because it was putting upward pressure on revenue growth. We now have the opposite effect, which is lower participation on benefits plans. It's been a trend that's been in place for it feels like six or so quarters. We have been watching it quarterly. We think that it probably has something to do with ACA, because you had people kind of first gearing up for ACA and then you had implementation of ACA and although technically many of the rules haven't changed around ACA, it has been, some of it has been defanged and you're getting, I think the outcome that you would expect if you are taking away laws and rules that encourage or force people to have benefits coverage. And so we are seeing \u2013 again, this is not a dramatic drop in benefits participation. But it's enough to pressure the revenue component of overall PEO revenues which is the largest component of total revenue. Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. So that's helpful. Just to switch gears to the EPS growth outlook for fiscal 2019. So we're talking about 13% to 15%. It sounds like ASC 606 cost you 2 points. So we're really looking at 15% to 17% if we were in an ASC 605 world. And so I'm just looking at that 15% to 17% relative to the 16% to 19% CAGR from the Analyst Day. Do we need to kind of recast that 16% to 19% in an ASC 606 context? Because I think a lot of people are just trying to think about this apples-to-apples versus you were living in the 605 world at the time of the Analyst Day but now you're obviously living in the 606 world. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah let me \u2013 I'll have Jan touch on that in a second. But I should have finished my PEO thought because your \u2013 I don't think I completed the answer to your question. I think that the reason we remain bullish after everything I just said about benefits, I'm trying to give you color and explain kind of what's happening in the revenue growth numbers and in the noise. But in the PEO, the most important thing for us in the PEO is profit per employee. And that is something that we continue to see reasonable growth in. And so the noise around margins and around pass-through revenue growth is just not really the right way to look at value creation because as we now answer your question about EPS, the most important thing for us is contribution to EPS. So the only place where we're unhappy about the PEO is that we had a slight deceleration in worksite employee growth, which obviously leads to slight decrease in overall growth of profit assuming all other things being equal. So that's a fair issue that's related really to our net new business, to bookings and retention, which we feel better about now going into the new year. But all the other stuff is just noise. And I think the real important thing is to remember that every time we move a client to the PEO or a worksite employee onto the PEO from a pay, it adds profit to the company. And so we have an incentive. We're highly incented to do that as much as possible. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: So relative to the impact of 605 and 606 to our medium-term expectations regarding EPS, so as you can deduct from our disclosures, the impact of 606 in fiscal year 2018 was a little bit higher than we had initially anticipated and is a little bit higher also I think in 2019 actually. But we have no outlook relative to its impact that changed compared to our Investor Day schedule that we provided for the outer years. So what that means is we finished 2018 a little bit ahead of our own expectations. So we have really terrific momentum going on. And we feel 2019 is exactly is in line and contributing to our overall goals. So we're not really changing our expectations for the medium run. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah. I would say, if anything we feel like the finish we had for 2018 gives us a lot of confidence about the momentum we have to be able to deliver on the commitments that we outlined at Investor Day. So I think the answer would be absolutely not, that I think we feel actually better. And I realize that the guidance and the discussions we had were about 2019 through 2021. But when you finish 2018 ahead of where you thought you were going to finish, we would like to get a little bit of credit for that because what we're trying to get to is higher overall margins, higher overall profit, higher overall EPS. And I think whether it happens in 2018 or 2019 or in 2020 or 2021, those are all good things for us. Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah, no, agreed. I mean clearly absolute levels of EPS are being guided above the Street. So kudos to you guys on that. Thanks for the color. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys. Just wanted to ask a little bit about the top-line guidance. Employer Services at 4% to 6%, I know it's been running about \u2013 Employer Services has been running about 4% organic. What's the path there to push it up towards the higher end? I think acquisitions and FX probably cancel each other out. So just thinking about what would cause the push toward 6%? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: So one of the things that is helping, which is obviously the positive is, we clearly see what appears to be, because of the recurring revenue nature of our business, when you have the challenges like we had with retention and new business bookings causes a lot of pressure on the core growth of an organic basis whether it's Employer Services or the PEO. We now, I would say that the middle of fiscal year 2018, it appears to be the trough. Certainly as of today it's the trough. You just, you don't know a year from now when you look back if that will be accurate. But today, it looks like the trough and so we see clear acceleration of the net of our new business, what we call our net new business which is the difference between our starts that result from sales and our losses. And so part of the acceleration in Employer Services is about around 0.5 points if you will of acceleration, which is in our world is good. I mean, when I look back to 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 kind of shortly after I became CEO, we had really great momentum around bookings like we have now. We had good retention which we have now. And we added between 0.5 points to 1 point of core growth if you will to the business. So that's my hope now for the next two or three years. And I think 2019 is the first year where we have that baked into the plan because we have the good bookings and we have I think a small improvement in retention also planned as well. I think Jan actually, when he talked about retention, he mentioned something about 2018 and 2019. So 2018 retention was 90.4%. And we're expecting a 20 to 25 basis point improvement over that in 2019. So I'm sorry, that's one of the factors. We also did include, we are including our interest income, our client funds interest income now as part of the Employer Services segment. And as you know, that's improving and growing. And so that's helping probably 0.5 points as well, 0.5% to 0.75 points, so I think that's how you get to the numbers you're asking about. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then on the PEO side. I know in the Analyst Day we talked about 11% to 14% kind of longer-term growth. Is there a path to get back to that as well or are some of these changes that we've talked about today for the lower growth more permanent in nature? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: So it's a good question. We looked at that yesterday and it's a hard path for sure. But the question is, do we really, is that really, even though we provided the guidance and we don't like backing off of guidance, I just talked about previously, that top-line revenue growth from the PEO is not really the most important number to look at from a value creation standpoint, which is why we're providing other disclosures around the PEO now to help with that. But clearly, it could happen because as we now, we're surprised by the deceleration in benefits revenue and the deceleration in workers' comp and SUI, you could have in 2020 or 2021 healthcare inflation which is not out of the realm of possibility that then gets us to that guidance. But frankly, if we got back into that range, it probably wouldn't change the EPS. And it would change the margins, but it wouldn't change EPS and it wouldn't change dollars of profit for the company. Because what that's driven by is the growth of worksite employees and by retention and new business bookings. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Thank you. Just wanted to test your confidence in replenishing the backlog or the pipeline given the strong bookings in the fourth quarter. Any change in salesforce growth or productivity functions? How's the pricing situation looking? And maybe if you can comment on what segments might lead or present a challenge for you in fiscal 2019 bookings? Long question there, sorry. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: We have strong confidence. I would say that our confidence is strong in continuing the momentum into the first quarter. I think it's probably, given the way new business bookings work, I think for us to sit here and say, we're obviously providing what we think are very confident numbers about the full year. But trying to look forward to the fourth quarter, you're hopefully not asking about that. So if you're just asking coming off of the first quarter, off of the fourth quarter, how do you feel going into the new year, I would reiterate strong. We feel very strong confidence in our momentum right now. In terms of, I think Jan said in his comments, I think the strength we see is really across the board. So I think all of the business units frankly are performing well from a new business bookings standpoint. It took some time. Our salesforce, it's, I know it seems like a long time ago but three or four years ago everyone was talking about compliance for ACA and increased government regulation and new laws around overtime and so forth. And so there was a fairly large shift in climate that required a retooling of a salesforce that had been focused more on selling additional business and selling additional modules to one that was focused on selling logos. And to the credit of the salesforce, which is really the greatest salesforce in the world, it made a massive turnaround. And now we have I think it's close to 60% of our new business bookings coming from new business and new logos versus probably 40% at the low point, when we had the Affordable Care Act giving us that tailwind. So it was a pretty massive retooling. And it took some time. We had to change incentives. We had to change focus and as usual they came through. And you can see the results now. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: All right. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: The good part of new logo growth acceleration, which I think is a good measure of the competitiveness in a new market, is that it was strong really across our segments. So we saw new logo growth really as we sold to new clients in all segments, which was particular focus, as we talked about that in the Investor Day. And those are playing off and that should give us a good run rate going forward. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: All right. Thanks for that. Just my quick follow-up, just on Global Cash Card and the Wisely app. Is the rollout there still on track? Can we still expect to see something in market by year-end? I ask because there seems like there's a lot of activity in that end market. Just wanted an update there. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Not to steal the thunder of the product teams, but Global Cash Card has a lot of momentum. We're selling already the Global Cash Card product, but also the new products are coming out and everything on both acquisitions are meeting their milestones. So we continue to be very excited about them. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from James Berkley with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. James Robert Berkley - Wolfe Research, LLC: Thanks for the time. Just to start, just wondering, what were some of those incentive changes that hurt PEO growth that were referred to in your earlier remarks, Carlos? And if the rebound you saw in fiscal fourth quarter holds, would that not imply that your guidance for 2019 on the PEO side could be conservative? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Well, I mean, I don't think that's fair. I think we would have taken that into account. I mean it would be nice to think that we had \u2013 but we really try to be pretty transparent in terms of providing guidance. And we take all factors into consideration including momentum, including recent results. So there's some fairness to that in the sense that the PEO plan was built really during the fourth quarter, while we were experiencing some of this improvement. On the other hand, if you look at the trajectory which is now different, the trajectory was down if you looked at the second and third quarter. Like we would have had a hard time building a great plan. So I think the good results in the fourth quarter just were added confidence if you will to a turnaround that we were planning for anyway, that we were trying to position ourselves for. So I think all things being equal, I think as with all of our other guidance, I think we're giving you what we really believe is achievable including in the PEO. And I'm sorry the first part of your question was? James Robert Berkley - Wolfe Research, LLC: Just some of the inside changes that hurt PEO growth that you guys ended up reversing. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah, I don't want to be mysterious or complicated. So we have other \u2013 our salesforces have incentives that we can vary at times. Like for example, our mid market salesforce has an incentive to provide leads to the PEO and they get a certain percentage sales credit which then drives commissions. And by the way, the sales credit is probably more important in some cases than the commission, but just because of the culture of our salesforce. But either way, we have these incentives in place. And if there are other products that salesforce we're trying to sell and we provide, we may not necessarily change the incentive to the PEO to drive leads to the PEO. But if we change an incentive to provide leads somewhere else, it may lead the salesforce somewhere else, which is what happened. And I don't want to get into too many specifics, but we have other for example BPO solutions that are also mid market oriented, which have also grown at a very healthy rate. And I think we saw kind of a temporary shift, if you will. And we have much higher value, both businesses are great businesses. Both are growing very rapidly. Both have good profitability. But the PEO has a higher dollar profit per worksite employee. And so we went back and readjusted that incentive. So it's not anything complicated or mysterious. It's just that the leads started going to a different place than where they maybe had the highest value to ADP. James Robert Berkley - Wolfe Research, LLC: All right. Understood. Thanks a lot. And then just real quick, this is more of a higher level macro type question, but I figure it's kind of worth asking given the environment. And you know just given that both the labor participation rate and unemployment levels are at historical lows now. Also thinking about demographic trends and the impact of rates such as retiring baby boomers have on the business and those unemployment and labor participation trends. How do you view the health of the U.S. employment market and sustainability of payroll growth overall going forward like the next one, two, three years here? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Well it's a great question for the obvious reasons in terms of where the numbers are. But I think today we reported I think 200,000 \u2013 what was the number? 217,000 additional added to the payroll. So honestly, I think Jan and I have been cautioning and telling ourselves that as unemployment goes down and the labor market tightens that we should see some kind of slowdown there. But we haven't seen it. And it could be as a result of, if you look at labor force participation, and yes it's driven somewhat by demographics, but there's still, there are some arguments to be made that there could be 3 million to 3.5 million people that are still on the sidelines, right. If you think you could get back to labor participation rates around I think 65%; I think we're at 64% going back to 65%. So again I'm not the macroeconomist. And we kind of try to plan based on the environment we have, the interest rates we have. And we try to be cautious about momentum. But right now, frankly the momentum is really good. So it would not have been prudent for us for 2019 to plan some large drop in employment or some, because it just doesn't feel like that's in the cards, because despite the tightness, apparent tightness of the labor market, you also have an economy that is incredibly strong and it's picked up momentum from a GDP standpoint. That generally creates demand for labor. That'll also create demand for improvements in productivity which will help the economy. And so it feels to me like a pretty good environment right now, but something that we should definitely watch out for. So I'm not trying to dismiss your point, but not much I can do about it now because it's just too much good news. James Robert Berkley - Wolfe Research, LLC: No, that makes sense. That's all I was trying to get at. It seemed like the labor participation rate being so low that there could be some slack despite unemployment being low as well, so appreciate the commentary. Thanks for your time. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah and by the way, we're just getting now back to, I think it was in the Journal, today they talked. We've seeing the same thing with wage inflation starting to pick up. But it's just now getting back to where it was on average over, call it, I think it was 2001 to 2007 is what the Journal said. And I think it's 2.7%, 2.8%. We show the same kind of trends in our wage inflation. And so even though you're seeing wage inflation, that's a response to for sure tightness in the labor markets. It doesn't change the fact that it's still not running at 4%. So there's something happening. There must be slack in the labor market. There has to be something there. James Robert Berkley - Wolfe Research, LLC: Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from David Grossman of Stifel Financial. Your line is open. David Michael Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp.: Thank you. Good morning. So you laid out three broad drivers of growth at the Investor Day. I think it was sales head count, sales productivity and new products. Could you help us understand your expectation of relative contribution from these initiatives in fiscal 2019? And how that may evolve once we get past next year given the timing of the broader new product rollout? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I'm going to let Jan maybe go through the specifics. But I think what we intended to talk about at Investor Day was a formula going forward not just for 2019, but I think is the way we think about the business which is to have kind of generally speaking balanced growth around head count, productivity of our head count in sales and then from new products. So, if you look at our guidance, I think generally a good way to look at it would be about a third of that growth coming from head count, about a third coming from new products and a third of it coming from productivity. And I don't know if Jan if you want to add? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: That's what I would have said. And it may be gearing ever so slightly a little bit higher on the head count side, but, and productivity side, but in general, that's the mix. And I think the team is optimistic about 2019 to achieve it with some moderate head count growth for the carrier side and then with a bunch of these new products aided by additional acquisitions that come into the pipeline to drive then the overall productivity in addition to the head count growth for the overall result. So that's exactly what. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah and I think to the previous question, Global Cash Card would be in that category. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: That's for example Global Cash Card is a new product that's actually meaningfully adding to our sales growth in 2018. David Michael Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp.: Okay. I guess I was thinking of the new products more like some of the next generation (56:18). Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah. So that's the separation (56:18), David. So next generation products will be a very small part only of our 2019 numbers. We accelerated, as we disclosed, a number of clients on the strategic platforms in order to scale and test. But Lifion, that number is not going to be impacting 2019. It will be more meaningful in 2020 and 2021. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah, as you know, we're very bullish on our next gen platforms and what they're going to do long-term health of the business. But from a technically speaking standpoint, it's just we're such a big company, I think our bookings for next year are $1.8 billion or somewhere in that neighborhood. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Growth on top of $1.8 billion. Christian Greyenbuhl - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: $1.5 billion is the Employer Services bookings number and we're guiding (57:15). Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I'm sorry. Right. The Employer Services bookings number. But and the bottom line is the numbers are big enough now that as we roll out new products, you have to have a lot of them. So our salesforce, when we tell them the same thing about next gen should be really helping you, they focus on this gen. Like they want to know what's available to sell now and so the good news is we have things like our analytics products. We have the acquisitions we just talked about. So we do have a number of things that we've been working on over the prior several years that have now provided ammunition for them to be able to go out and have some portion of that sales guidance come from \"new products\", notwithstanding the fact that our next generation platforms are just not quite at the point where they're going to make a meaningful impact on sales in 2019. David Michael Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp.: Okay. Got it. Thanks for that. And then just two quick follow-ups. One is I didn't quite understand the unit growth comment maybe that Jan made about the high teens. Is that client growth versus WSE growth? Maybe I just missed that. If you could clarify that and just... Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: And I was (58:26), so I apologize David for that. So just, because you're asking, our ADP client growth overall, number of clients that are with ADP grew by 6%. That's the entire base to the 740,000 clients or so. That's about 6%, which is very healthy growth. It's nice, and we're very proud of that. When I referred to our high teens in new logo growth, we refer about the number of new clients that we were able to sell to and compare that to the number of new clients that we sold last year. And that's a different number. That's kind of new logo growth number relative to our new business bookings number. And that really accelerated very nicely in the PEO last year. And so which means basically we had a reacceleration of new business bookings in the PEO, but a lot more smaller clients and the average deal size was a little smaller. David Michael Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp.: Okay. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah, that average deal size had actually grown, had gone up in the last several years. And I think some of it was again, I hate to keep going back, I think we drove some of that through our incentives because I think it's a product that fits both the down market and the mid market very well. David Michael Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp.: Okay got it. And just one last quick one. The acquisition, does that contribute? Could you just size that for us in terms of revenue and profit contribution in 2019? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: The acquisition of Celergo that we announced today is going to be not meaningful to the overall revenue growth. David Michael Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp.: Got it. All right guys, thanks very much. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Very meaningful strategically if I may add. Because again as Jan was alluding to, we're in this conundrum always where we talk about our size. We're $13.3 billion in revenue or whatever the number is for 2018 here that we finished. So when we make an acquisition that is meaningful and strategic and we're very excited about it, unfortunately, financially, it might not have a big impact. But we certainly expect it to have a big impact in our ability to continue selling and be successful in the multinational space which is a, again a mid teens growing business for us and this just extends that leadership and I think that success that we're having in that space. David Michael Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp.: Okay, got it. Thanks again. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Silber with BMO. Your line is open. Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey good morning guys. It's Henry Chien calling for Jeff. Just wanted to shift over and ask about the margin outlook and where you're getting, or I guess where you're looking to drive margin expansion. Just curious if you could share a little bit more about what areas of the business you think you can get that expansion beyond the early retirement and if any color on how much of that is leverage versus some of the maybe more discrete items that you're doing to improve margins overall? Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: So I think we've been doing a lot of work. And I think Jan can probably add a couple of examples. But we've been doing a lot of work over the last year or two around what we call process improvement, in trying to really as an example reduce non-value contacts. So we want to make sure that the products themselves are intuitive, easy to use and that we build in solutions so that people don't have to seek out help. Clearly we're a solutions provider, not just a software provider, so if someone wants help, we're there to help them, but we want to be value added. The non-value added interactions are dissatisfiers for the client and also increase costs for us. And so I think we've made progress in the last couple years in reducing what we refer to as our non-value contacts. So that's a source of margin improvement because it reduces the number of people we need to service X number of clients. And so it's really a productivity enhancement effort. So I'd say most of the margin improvement that we expect to get, and I would say that the voluntarily retirement is wrapped up into that, because it has to be factored into the overall amount of labor you have is to increase productivity. So increase really revenue per associate or per employee while revenues continue to grow. So as an example, I think in 2018 we finished with our growth in full-time employees being relatively flat, like compared to what we consider to be pretty good revenue growth. And I think for 2019, we would see kind of a similar picture, maybe slight increase. But we've kind of brought down the nose of the ship if you will in terms of the growth of the number of people we need in order to service X number of clients. So we're trying to grow the business obviously faster, but we're trying to grow the expense and the number of people to service those clients at a slower rate than even we were growing before. And I think that's what leads to margin improvement. So that's a simplified way of describing dozens of things that we have underway to make ourselves better and more efficient. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: The part of the sources of the margin expansion for your benefit, the most important one as Carlos just described and they're driven then underlining with tools like the early retirement, like our Service Alignment Initiative and general business improvement initiatives to reduce the workload and make our workforce more effective. And so that's a very important part of this. But also our IT folks make meaningful progress to support our infrastructure, that we do see some benefits of reduced complexity because our product set is now simpler and they have really worked hard to drive and control our overall IT infrastructure costs. So we have seen help from that in this fiscal year and I think we anticipate that going forward. And not to give when we talk about scale, scale doesn't happen on its own. And the most important driver to help with scale is improving retention and we have emphasized that I think throughout our communications that healthy revenue growth and improving retentions are very important to support sustained margin growth, because if you keep a client, obviously you don't have to sell it as a new client. And it's generally high margin business for those clients retained. So we have other factors that also help in the margin expansion momentum. And I think in the Investor Day I mentioned other initiatives like focusing on our vendor spend for example and a broad range of other things that we are undergoing that will help. But it's not only one thing. It's a lot of initiatives. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: The bottom line is I think fewer platforms, a simplified environment, and then next generation solutions that are much more efficient to operate, more efficient to develop on and more efficient to maintain I think is really part of the formula. Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got it. Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up on the client migration split. What part, I guess what areas of the business is still remaining for migrations if there's any? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: We're still focusing on our enterprise space where we have a bunch of legacy clients to migrate and there's also work for us to do in our international business. So we maintained our migration investment year-over-year and focus now a little bit more in the enterprise space. Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got it. Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Marcon of R.W. Baird. Your line is open, Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering with regards to ES, on the service centers side, can you give us an update with regards to just the service centralization across the five big project centers and how that's progressing and what you're seeing in terms of client satisfaction scores? And then the second part of the question is, as you look out towards ES for 2019, would you expect the strongest growth to be on SBS and majors relative to national or would you expect international to be one of the strongest growth areas or how would you characterize the strongest growth? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: So let me give you a quick update on our Service Alignment Initiative which is really progressing very nicely. So we are very satisfied with the momentum that we have and the transition that worked out. So, we have about, we hired close to 3,000, 2,700 associates in these new service centers which were three new ones and two existing ones, all in about 6,000 associates now. And we have exited about 90% of all targeted locations really on schedule or slightly ahead of schedule. So the program has been working and now we are rooting in. And as we have indicated the trend continues. We have great employment, employee engagement and excellent client satisfaction scores. That is now so meaningful because a large chunk of the business is in these service centers. So that helped to the improvement in our overall satisfaction. So this is going very well for 2019. We're at scale. So I don't anticipate any dual ops pressure. We had dual ops in 2018. So that's coming out. And we have expanded a few additional locations based on the success of those centers. So all in good light relative to service alignment and our business case. Relative to, Mark I apologize second question was? Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: It's just basically as we look at U.S. growth for the coming year. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Oh the growth, the growth rate in the year. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Like where we would expect the strongest growth versus more moderate growth. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: The question, the strong growth in the ES portfolio is a little more centered around the down market components and our HR BPO offerings throughout all segments actually. So we had good growth in the non-PEO HR BPO offerings and our multinational offerings. So the strength of the growth drivers that we have historically observed, I think we expect to continue. And then we see actually an acceleration of the revenue performance in the mid and the up markets. So it's accelerating and improving, so all segments are really improving in our 2019 plan. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: That's great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we have time for one more question. Our last question is from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Most of my questions have been answered. But one question I did want to ask was related to M&A. Should we anticipate that we may be entering into a period of elevated M&A activity or do you expect to maintain kind of the same pace you have over time? And can you just give a little bit of color on the conditions in the M&A market in terms of being able to find appropriate targets and valuation, et cetera? Thank you. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: So it's a great question. I mean, I'm very pleased with what we've been able to do on the acquisition front over the last 12 to 18 months. And I think if we could continue to find things like we have found the last 18 months, we would do those all day long. The challenge of course for us as you know is we are in the process of simplifying, reducing platforms, focusing on our next generation platforms. And so that makes it hard to do what I would call traditional, make traditional acquisitions. So we're not looking for example for the next benefits platform. We're not looking for the next payroll platform. We're building our own next generation payroll platform. We have a great one already that is serving us well and is a very, very profitable. And so it is challenging because when you look at the HCM space, we operate in really across almost every segment from hire to retire. And we feel great about the products and the platforms that we have. But as you saw over the last 18 months, there's always some stuff you can do that's new and can add to the portfolio. So I think as long as it's additive and fits into our strategic roadmap, we are buyers. And we're on the lookout for those types of ways to use our capital, right, to add shareholder value. So it's kind of hard to give you a completely bullish answer, because we're trying to be very, very disciplined, but we've been very, very fortunate in the last 18 months. And I hope that our luck continues and that we find things that can really be difference makers for our clients, but and to our growth rates, but that also fit into our strategic roadmap and don't just add additional complexity. James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for any closing remarks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thanks. Just quickly, obviously this year we spent a lot of time listening to our shareholders and to all of you as well. And I think our interactions this year, I think just I think reinforced our conviction in the strategy that we're pursuing. We got very positive feedback from our Investor Day about our plans and our strategy to create sustainable long-term value. So we're going to continue obviously on the path that we're on. The results this year I think really set us up well for fiscal 2019. We feel like we've seen some acceleration, as I mentioned, I would call it a trough if you will in the middle of this last fiscal year. So I think heading into next year, we have really good momentum. So whether it's the next generation platforms that we just talked about, or the mid market migrations or the acquisitions that we just talked about or progress on the Service Alignment Initiative or the voluntary early retirement program, I think it's pretty clear that we are committed to accelerating the pace of change at ADP and that we're actually well underway. I'm particularly pleased, I have to say this year, with the ability of the organization overall to overcome the pressures that we had from bookings and retention, call it a couple of years ago, that right in the middle of the perfect storm of the Affordable Care Act and some other things that distracted us. But we're past that. You can see that we had solid performance in 2018 and I'm really, that makes me very, very optimistic about the future for ADP. So, and I think lastly, I have to as always say that when we reflect on all these accomplishments, which are many in 2018, I just want to thank all of our associates for their dedication to providing the best-in-class solutions to our clients, because our business is all about our clients and our clients are all about the associates that serve them. So with that, I want to thank you for listening in today, and thank you for your continued interest in ADP.",

David Michael Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC James Robert Berkley - Wolfe Research LLC Operator : Good morning. My name is Christy, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's First Quarter Fiscal 2019 Earnings Call. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I will turn the conference over to Mr. Christian Greyenbuhl, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Christian Greyenbuhl - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you, Christy, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining ADP's first-quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call and webcast. With me today are Carlos Rodriguez, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jan Siegmund, our Chief Financial Officer. Earlier this morning we released our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. These materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com where you will also find quarterly investor presentation that accompanies today's call as well as our quarterly history of revenue and pre-tax earnings by reportable segment. During our call today we will reference non-GAAP financial measures which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items in the first quarter and full year of fiscal 2019 as well as the first quarter and full year of fiscal 2018. A description of these items and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release. Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Finally, I would like to remind you the last quarter we outlined various changes to our disclosures and reporting which are now fully implemented. As a result of some of these changes, we noted a desire for supplemental information regarding our new PEO disclosures and guidance. Accordingly, we have provided you with additional slides in our accompanying investor presentation which we believe will help enhance the understanding of these new disclosures. As always, please do not hesitate to reach out should you have any questions. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Carlos. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you, Christian, and good morning, everyone. This morning we reported our first quarter fiscal 2019 results with revenue of $3.3 billion, up 8% reported and 7% organic constant currency. We are pleased with this revenue growth which was above our expectations and which was aided in part by the better-than-expected performance of our PEO segment and continued strengthen our Employer Services downmarket offerings. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 28% to $1.20 per share and in addition to strong revenue and margin performance benefited from fewer shares outstanding as well as a lower effective tax rate. We also so positive momentum in our Employer Services new business bookings which grew 8% in the first quarter, slightly ahead of our expectations. In addition while we no longer report consolidated bookings, we were especially pleased that the renewed momentum in our PEO from last quarter has continued into the first quarter of fiscal 2019 with strong double digit bookings growth. In both Employer Services and the PEO, we once again saw improvements in our overall client satisfaction scores and we also continue to expect a 25 basis point to 50 basis point improvement in ES revenue retention for fiscal 2019. Overall, we are pleased with our start to the fiscal year which supports our confidence in our long-term strategy and our efforts to accelerate our pace of change with care. At our June Investor Day, we had the opportunity to discuss with you our efforts around innovation and we were excited to continue those discussions in September when we attended HR Tech in Las Vegas and the following week at our annual Industry Analyst Day at our Chelsea innovation Lab. At each of these events we discussed our transformation from a service company supported by technology, to a technology company that offers great service, one with a proven ability to anticipate the changing demands of employers from small businesses to global enterprises. Our transformation is taking place in the midst of a rapidly evolving landscape. Quite literally, the evolution of work is redefining how work gets done. We believe in our innovation journey and in the opportunities it represents for our clients and our stakeholders. At ADP we embrace this kind of change and we are excited about what it means for our business and our growth. Change has always served as a driving force behind our innovative spirit and we were thrilled to take home this year's HR Tech Awesome New Tech award for Wisely by ADP, our unique way to help workers manage their financial wellness needs. This is ADP's fourth consecutive year winning this category, an unparalleled accomplishment among HCM companies. Each year that we have earned this award, we find ourselves in the company of impressive tech start-ups, underscoring that while we are big we are also innovative and nimble. At our Industry Analyst Day we hosted more than 20 HCM industry analysts and similar to what we shared with many of you at our Investor Day, we discussed with them our next-gen HCM solutions. We were pleased with the reception that we received as we firmly believe that our solutions are uniquely built to address the key challenges and needs of an increasingly complex and rapidly changing world of work. In fact, one well-respected analyst summarized this point after the event when he described our new platforms as the disruption that could change the entire HCM market. We are excited to have several clients live on our new platforms and we continue to make good progress on our targets and our development efforts. As the traditional model of work continues to evolve, it is being augmented by new pay-on-demand model which is beginning to replace traditional weekly and biweekly payrolls. With this evolution in mind, we are excited about our development efforts to build and scale our new payroll and tax engines which are designed to provide full payroll calculations in real time at the individual worker level. Taking this a step further with Wisely by ADP, employers of any size and industry can today have access to tools to better engage their workforce by providing attractive services such as instant pay, access to a digital wallet, and other financial management and wellness features. In addition to leading with great technology, we are leveraging our unmatched data set to empower our clients, HR practitioners and business leaders with actionable insights. ADP pays one in six U.S. employees and this scale drives unmatched depth to the insights we can offer through our DataCloud and benchmarking solutions. One such solution which is already integrated into the ADP Mobile Solutions app is our executive and manager insights tool which leverages machine learning to continually sift through wage, time, location, industry and many other types of data to uncover insights that HR leaders can use to make better, faster and smarter decisions. During the quarter we also completed our acquisition of Celergo, a provider of multicountry payroll management services. The acquisition further solidifies our global HCM leadership position and enhances our ability to deliver multicountry payroll solutions with a strong platform and new capabilities including cross-currency and ex-pat payment services. In addition to these new offerings, Celergo also extends our footprint to over 140 countries and brings with it a talented team with significant experience in multicountry payroll, which remains a key area of opportunity for ADP. We are incredibly excited about the potential of Celergo and other recent investments and acquisitions including Global Cash Card and WorkMarket which collectively expand our ability to address a changing workforce that is increasingly global, freelance and in demand of flexible payment solutions. Now I'd like to touch on some of the key initiatives coming out of our transformation office which has been helping to formalize, structure and create the accountability needed to achieve our financial objectives. While our transformation continues to progress at a healthy pace, we are being careful to balance speed with care, underscoring our focus on the long-term and our commitment not to compromise quality for short-term gains. Maintaining the highest standards for our clients, associates and shareholders is our utmost priority and we are pleased with our ability to execute on our transformation objectives while also driving improvements in client satisfaction, productivity and the associate experience. Our voluntary early retirement program is progressing as planned. We remain focused on managing this initiative in an orderly and timely manner. Additionally through our service alignment initiative, we continue to reduce our footprint in subscale locations and at our new strategic service locations, we are seeing greater efficiency and collaboration which is helping to enhance the level of service we provide our clients. Before I turn the call over to Jan, I'd like to highlight that we were recently named 2018 Working Mother 100 Best Company. As a leader in the HR community, this is an especially great honor and I'm thrilled to see ADP receive the credit for creating an inclusive and diverse workplace where everyone can bring their best self to work each day. I am proud to lead a company that values the contribution of every individual and has a proven track record for attracting and retaining top talent. This allows us to remain competitive in a dynamic HCM market and has a profound impact on our continued growth and success. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jan for his commentary on our first quarter results and fiscal 2019 outlook. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. Our consolidated revenue this quarter was $3.3 billion, up 8% reported and 7% organic constant currency, both above expectations. On a reported basis, earnings before income taxes increased 14% while our adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT increased 18%. Adjusted EBIT margin was slightly above our expectation and was up about 180 basis points compared to last year's fiscal quarter despite about 50 basis points of pressure from acquisitions and a $12 million charge related to the write-off of certain internally-developed software costs following our acquisition of Celergo. Overall, our margin performance continues to benefit from improvements in our IT infrastructure spend, the lapping of dual operating costs related to our service alignment initiative and the successful execution of our broader transformation initiatives including our voluntary early retirement program. We were also particularly pleased with our international businesses where the results of our automation efforts continue to generate positive momentum. Clearly, our efforts to reduce our costs while also improving our service are beginning to pay off and we are pleased with the progress that we're making. Our adjusted effective tax rate was positively impacted by unplanned stock compensation tax benefits which drove approximately 330 basis points of benefit for the quarter or $0.05 on our adjusted diluted earnings per share. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 28% to $1.20 and, in addition from benefiting from our margin performance and a lower effective tax rate, was also aided by fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. As you can tell from these overall results, we are off to a good start this year and we're progressing well as we execute on our strategic plans that we outlined at our June Investor Day. Now let me take you through our segment results. For Employer Services, revenues grew 7% for the quarter, 6% organic constant currency, both ahead of our expectations. Interest from client funds grew 19% and benefited from a 30 basis points improvement in the average yield earned on our client fund investments and growth in average client fund balances of about 5% compared to a year ago. This growth in balances was driven by a combination of client growth, wage inflation and growth in our pays per control, offset by pressure from the corporate tax reform and lower state unemployment insurance collections. Our same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.4% for the quarter. Our international solutions continued to perform well supported by the continued strong double digit growth of our multinational offerings. Investing in our global solutions and leveraging our global presence to service our clients wherever they do business remains a key strategic pillar for us and we were especially pleased this quarter to be able to complete our recent strategic acquisition of Celergo to further complement our offerings in this space. Moving on to Employer Services margin, we saw an increase of about 260 basis points in the quarter, which included approximately 90 basis points of pressure from the impact of acquisitions. As you will recall, our voluntary early retirement program is being managed over the course of multiple phases throughout this fiscal year. As we progress against our backfill targets for the year, this quarter we saw benefits from early exits which we do not anticipate to carry forward into the remainder of the fiscal year as we accelerate our targeted backfill hiring plans. PEO revenue grew 10% for the quarter with average worksite employees growing 9% to 528,000. Following a difficult fiscal year 2018 in the 50-employee and above market, we were pleased to see signs of a continued recovery in our PEO new business bookings this quarter and also some early signs of improvements in our client retention. While we are pleased with this performance, it's also important to remember that we're nearing the calendar end when clients in our industries are more likely to reevaluate their provider. The PEO segment's margins increased 110 basis points for the quarter and benefited from operating leverage and selling efficiencies, partially offset by the impact from changes in our estimated losses related to ADP Indemnity. Now on to our fiscal year 2019 outlook. This quarter I would like to start first by talking about the segment outlook before we move on to our consolidated outlook. As a reminder, as of last quarter we are providing incremental guidance for our segment revenue in particular. We believe you will find this helpful and we encourage you to leverage this and the long-term revenue model that we shared at our Investor Day. With that said, let's discuss our outlook. While our first quarter Employer Services revenue growth was ahead of our expectations, we now anticipate incremental pressure from FX as the year progresses. We also want to remind you that we are lapping our acquisition of Global Cash Card in the second quarter, and as such we continue to expect 4% to 6% revenue growth for the ES segment. We still anticipate growth of 2.5% in our pays per control metric. There's no change in our forecasted growth of ES new business bookings of 6% to 8% and we continue to anticipate a more difficult grow-over in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. As Carlos mentioned, we also continue to anticipate an increase in ES retention of 25 basis points to 50 basis points for fiscal year 2019. Finally while our ES margins were stronger than expected this quarter, we continue to anticipate a ramp-up in resources as we execute on our backfill hiring plans related to our voluntary early retirement program. As such, we do not anticipate as strong a margin expansion in the latter half of the fiscal year 2018 as we saw in the first quarter, and therefore we continue to anticipate full year margin expansion of about 150 basis points to 175 basis points inclusive of 50 basis points of acquisition drag. With that said, let's now touch on the PEO. We now expect 8% to 9% PEO revenue growth in fiscal year 2019 driven by 8% to 9% growth in average worksite employees as compared to our prior forecasted increase of 7% to 9% for revenue and 7% to 8% for average worksite employees. As Carlos mentioned, we have seen some progress in our PEO bookings this quarter following some of our targeted adjustments that we made last year to our PEO distribution process. We now expect to see a slight improvement in our PEO performance relative to prior expectations. With that said, we had a fairly strong second quarter revenue growth last year driven in part by a combination of solid worksite employee growth and strong pass-throughs. With these adjustments in mind, we now anticipate 6% to 7% growth in the PEO revenues excluding zero margin pass-throughs as compared to our prior forecast of 5% to 7%. As a reminder, the reason this growth is slightly below that of average worksite employees is due to the impact in fiscal year 2019 from the decline in our workers' compensation and SUI rates relative to fiscal year 2018. This does not affect the administrative services pricing environment which has remained a stable contributor to our overall revenue growth. Last quarter we received a few questions regarding our new pass-through disclosures. With that in mind in our effort to help you better understand the dynamics that we anticipate experiencing this year, we have provided you with some additional details in the appendix of our quarterly investor presentation. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with these slides as they help to illustrate the impact from lower workers' compensation and SUI rates as well as other drivers in the business. Moving on to PEO margins. With the better than expected performance in our PEO margin this quarter, we now expect 50 points to 25 points margin decrease as compared to our prior forecasted decrease of 75 basis points to 50 basis points. For the reasons we mentioned before, we continue to anticipate our voluntary early retirement backfill hiring to accelerate over the next few months. Accordingly, we do not expect this quarter's margin overperformance to carry fully through for the remainder of the year. Finally, I would like to remind you that the results of ADP Indemnity are now recorded within the PEO segment. This quarter, we had lower than anticipated grow-over pressure from adjustments to our loss reserve estimates, and as a result we now anticipate approximately 50 basis points of grow-over pressure on a full year basis as compared to our prior forecast of approximately 75 basis points. Moving on to the consolidated outlook, we now anticipate total revenue growth of 6% to 7% for fiscal year 2019 with the upper end of our forecast range dependent on the continued steady improvements in the performance of our PEO. We are now expecting growth in client funds interest revenue to increase $90 million to $100 million compared to our prior forecasted increase of $80 million to $90 million. The total impact from the client funds extended investment strategy is now expected to be up $70 million to $80 million compared to the prior forecasted increase of $60 million to $70 million. The details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides in our Investor Relations website. We continue to anticipate that our adjusted EBIT margin to expand 100 basis points to 125 basis points including approximately 30 basis points of pressure from acquisitions. With the impact of the first quarter stock compensation related tax benefit, we now expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 24.5% in fiscal year 2019 as compared to our prior adjusted effective tax rate of 25.1%. With these various adjustments to our outlook, we now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to grow 15% to 17%. Overall, I think you can tell we are happy with our start into the year and with the continued momentum that we're building from our investments in the business. We are executing well on our key initiatives and we were pleased to see a positive trend in our bookings this quarter. So with that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. Please ask one question with a brief follow-up. We will take our first question from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Jason Kupferberg - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Nice job here. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the bookings here. So you came in at the high end of the full year range in Q1, but based on the disclosures you gave us on ES bookings for last year, obviously the comps actually get a lot harder, especially in the back half, which you highlighted. It sounds like you've got a lot of confidence still in the 6% to 8%. Anything you'd highlight from a pipeline perspective, whether it's downmarket, mid-market, enterprise, et cetera? Just supporting that confidence in the full year number? Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think our confidence is really driven by, I guess the information that we have around where we are around head count, where we are around kind of new product rollouts and where we are around productivity improvements, which are the three ways that we add up to the overall sales growth. As you know, it can vary from quarter to quarter, but I think we have \u2013 we've built a great plan, I think with the right number of people, I think with the right products, and I think we've shown over the last probably three to four quarters, I think, really improvements in underlying productivity that then support that third pillar of what leads to the overall growth. So I think we feel \u2013 I think you're right that the tone is probably one of confidence, but as always, for us, the sales number is the one that has the most variability and the most volatility because every sale is a new sale every quarter, whereas in \u2013 our revenue model is really a recurring revenue model. So there's always more variability in sales, but I would say nothing has changed in terms of the level of confidence that we have in our ability to reach our full year numbers. We did have a very strong fourth quarter. Sometimes, historically, that has led to challenges in the first quarter just because of the way our incentives work. So in some respects, I would probably say that I was pleased with the fact that we were able to \u2013 even though we had an easier comparison to the prior year, the fact that we came off of a very strong fourth quarter, I think sometimes presents some headwinds. So the ability to kind of hit the numbers that we did this quarter, which as you're seeing obviously Employer Services number, but as Jan maybe alluded to, even though we're not giving specific guidance, our PEO results were also very strong. So when you look at f new business bookings collectively, if you did it the way we used to do it, which we're not doing anymore, we would say that we were extremely pleased and it adds to our confidence for the full year. Jason Kupferberg - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Okay. And let me just \u2013 yes. Please, go ahead, Jan. Sorry. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: One comment is that the success was fairly broad-based and so when I look at the different components of our sales force, the different channels and the different market segments that we sell into, it was really a broad-based contribution of many. So it was not focused on a single segment at all actually and broad-based participation is always a good start into the year. Jason Kupferberg - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: For sure. Let me just ask a follow-up on PEO since you highlighted that. And I know last quarter, there was a little bit of controversy or concern there. Clearly, a nice rebound so just wanted to test the sustainability of that. Maybe you can talk about some of the strategies that you've employed to actually drive the improved performance and the outlook there. I think last quarter you were talking about tweaking some incentive programs, but any other strategies you would highlight there? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah, I think that Jan probably has a couple of comments as well, but I would say that we did tweak the incentives. I would say that that's beginning to roll its way through, but I wouldn't say \u2013 I wish I could say that it all was because of how smart we were in changing those incentives, but I think we see big improvements in pipeline in the upmarket as a result of some of those incentive changes, but not necessarily yet affecting the numbers. So ironically, this was really kind of a rebound of what I would call core PEO performance. So again, that makes me, again, very optimistic about the next couple of quarters and the full year for PEO new business bookings, because we have yet to see \u2013 have the benefits of some of the incentive changes we made, which I think makes sense and I think are really just adjustments back to, frankly, prior. We didn't do anything artificial or aggressive to try to overcome some kind of externality. We were readjusting back to normal level some incentives that we had changed to other HR BPO products a couple of years ago. So I think that when I add all the things together, it feels like just really \u2013 as usual, it comes back to great execution. I think there's just more focus and more attention on kind of the basics and the core of generating new leads by our sales force, as well as making sure that they are more effective in getting the leads from the other parts of our sales force in ADP. So I think it's just overall just much better execution. And then, lastly, I would say that, again, here you have maybe the opposite effect of what I described about what usually happens when you have a strong finish, sometimes you get into a weaker start which didn't happen to us this first quarter. But in the PEO, we did have a challenging year and sometimes in some parts of our organization when you come off of a challenging year, you have a \u2013 so last year may have been not as weak as maybe it looked, and this first quarter was \u2013 I think it's probably the strongest growth we've had I think ever in the PEO. Sorry. I'm being corrected here, since Q2 of fiscal year 2014, but the numbers were already big in 2014 and they're even bigger today. So I think to generate the kind of growth rate we generated this quarter is quite impressive I think. And it shows that the value proposition is still intact and that the sales leadership and sales execution still has the ability to take advantage, if you will, of that value proposition and get it to the market in a competitive way. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I just have a few data points that really support what Carlos said. We saw not only improvement in our deals over 50 which we accelerated, but we had overall for the PEO channel there brisk new logo growth in the high double digits, so a very, very impressive broad-base. So it's not only a single thing, like a commission change for the mid-market or an incentive change in the mid-market, that drove this. It's a management focus and it created a broad-based acceleration of new business bookings that I think we've managed, also, to improve with very solid client satisfaction scores and great execution. So that created, then, our confidence to really up the guidance for that segment. Jason Kupferberg - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Okay. Well, great. That's nice color. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Lisa Ellis with MoffatNathanson. Your line is open. Lisa Ellis - MoffettNathanson LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. In fiscal 2018, I believe you grew client growth down in the lower end of the market in the 12% range, a really strong number. Can you give a little color as to whether that momentum and those share gains in the small and medium business market are continuing as you look into 2019? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah. I think the first quarter was very consistent with the momentum and the trend we've had for \u2013 I don't think it was just fiscal year 2018. It probably wasn't quite as strong in 2017, but we've had good strong momentum I think in our downmarket business, and I think it continued into the first quarter. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: First quarter is right in line with the trend that we have seen in 2018, Lisa. Lisa Ellis - MoffettNathanson LLC : Okay. Great. And then I think the complementary question is just one around the mid-market, where I know as you were going through the Workforce Now transition, you were sort of hanging on to your client counts in that market which we know it's very competitive. Now that you're through the Workforce Now migrations, are you seeing some improvement there, some growth in the client base in that market, if nothing else, just driven by improvements in retention? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah. So we have seen a very consistent improvement in our retention rates out of the \u2013 from the lows that we had about 2, 2.5 years ago, and so we're very pleased with the improvement that we have seen, A, through all the clients being now on a single platform, the stabilization and improvement in the new service models that we rolled out as part of the service alignment initiative, and very, very steady, retention has been improving. And so the new sales success if I \u2013 in this market if I just take like an average for the last rolling 12 months or so, we have also seen much more stronger focus on the new logo execution that we reported to you on focusing on new distribution channels through partners as well as leveraging sales force adjustments to focus on this. And I think we're still in the early stages of seeing a full turnaround for that, but we're seeing very good signs that this new logos focus will pay off over time. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah. And this quarter I would just add that this quarter, we actually happen to have good logo growth in the upper end of the mid-market which for us is, call it, 500 employees to 1000 employees or 150 employees to 500 employees in kind of that space there. And so again, quarter to quarter numbers is tricky in terms of the sales results. But I think there's definitely renewed focus and attention, and these are incentives that we adjusted different from what we were talking about in the PEO case. More, call it 18 to 24 months ago as we exited ACA, we tried to get our sales force more focused on core logo growth. And I would say that we feel like it's working and that we're making progress. And the combination of that along with improving retention, I think is, we still have work to do, but I think is getting our mid-market business into a stronger position, especially now that we're on one platform. Lisa Ellis - MoffettNathanson LLC : Terrific. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a follow-up to Lisa's question. I understand you're not giving explicit retention metrics on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but it sounds like on the basis of the consumer satisfaction scores you talked about improving that retention probably is just directionally up year-over-year. Can you confirm if that's the case or not, and maybe just kind of talk about whether there's any pockets of down, mid, or upmarket that are kind of falling above or below your expectations? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: So I think, as you heard I think in the comments, we confirmed our forecast for increased retention of I believe it's 25 basis points to 50 basis points for the year. So you could probably interpret that as directionally up for the year. But given that we're not providing retention guidance as part of the package of \u2013 we added a lot of disclosures and I think if you look at the amount of stuff that we just put out, I think historically and in response to some extent to some of the feedback we got after the proxy contest, we're doing what we can to add additional disclosure. And I think that's one of the items that we're not going to be getting into on a quarterly basis. But I think that you should interpret our confidence and reaffirmation of our guidance as confidence that the trend of retention is up. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's helpful. And then maybe kind of as a follow-up. With respect to your full year guidance, I know you talked about several grow-over issues with respect to acquisitions and a couple of other things that get harder in terms of comps for the year. But I think for the full year guidance it implies that growth slows down across almost every metric relative to what you already reported in Q1. So I'm just trying to understand whether there is anything that gives you pause about a potential slowdown in growth or whether there is some wiggle room potentially baked into the guidance? Thank you. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: As you can imagine, we spent some time talking about that to make sure you guys walked away with the right message which is one of confidence and optimism and pride in what really were good results. But there are some mathematical issues that I think are just important noting. So I think two that stand out for me are Global Cash Card was not quite a 1% impact but somewhere in the neighborhood of 1% impact on revenue growth. And that we lap, I believe it's in the middle of October. And then FX pressure, not just for us but for all companies, is picking up a little bit. It's not a huge headwind, but that obviously can change in either direction. But based on the information that we have today and the math, we kind of laid out what we thought was reasonable changes in guidance while trying to convey really our sense of optimism and confidence and positiveness in what the results were. So it's hard to, given that it's the first quarter, it's also, frankly, hard for us to just come out and across the board change everything given that we still have three quarters ahead of us. But we wanted to make sure you got a message of confidence and optimism and pride in the first quarter. But we want to make sure that the math rolls through in the appropriate manner. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Received loud and clear. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC : Good morning. Strong start to FY 2019. I'd like to ask about pricing trends as you head into the critical year-end selling season. What are you seeing in terms of kind of price net of discounting on a year-over-year basis? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Well funny you should mention that, because back to the previous question in terms of one thing that we just don't want to take one quarter and assume that it's going to continue on. But we have seen, I would say, a better environment in terms of overall discounting in pricing and so forth. And the issue is, there is no scientific way to know how much of that is \u2013 I don't think the competition is getting any easier. I think we're getting better and stronger, our value proposition and our client satisfaction scores. There's other things that probably work into that mix. So in a very difficult environment where you have challenges like we had during ACA because of high volumes and caused some short-term deterioration in our service level, that probably leaves elevated concessions and pricing on pressure et cetera., the sales force starts to lose a little bit of its confidence. So I think we've regained a lot of that momentum, and it comes through, in part, it comes through in retention, it comes through in bookings, and it comes through in pricing and discounting. So I guess it's a long way of saying I can't answer your question because we don't know how much of what appears to be a better environment for us is related to economic versus issues around our own house being in better order versus the competition. If I had to guess, I would say it has not to do with the competition because the competition is still very fierce and there's plenty of competitors. And we are always out there sharpening our pencils, especially when we're so focused on bringing in new logos. So I think it's just \u2013 we're just doing a better job and it's translating to overall a better level. And that translates into our revenue growth, translates into retention. It has a lot of positive impacts. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC : Understood. And then as a follow-up, you seem very optimistic about Celergo and the potential for multicountry payroll. We haven't heard that much about international payroll processing in a while. Can you tell us how you're pulling together GlobalView, Vantage HCM and now Celergo to go to market internationally? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah, David, two answers for that. Actually this quarter we had particularly strong performance of our international operations, which resulted in great new business bookings in that sector, great margin expansion. We had a very, very solid \u2013 good retention, very solid performance internationally. When we talk internationally this extends in this quarter for both the best-of-breed countries where we serve local clients outside the U.S., as well as our strength in our multicountry and multinational solutions. And Celergo and our business that we call Streamline will be fully integrated and become our multicountry solution that services client needs with smaller employee populations in those countries. And GlobalView has always been targeted for our multinational clients that have large populations in each of these countries. But both product components or service components are basically sold together today as bundles in an integrated multicountry solution. So we are so excited about it because we see that ADP is truly differentiated in our ability \u2013 basically, we would claim the only vendor who can offer multicountry solutions at this scale, at this consistency to that many clients of different needs. And we made an investment into Celergo to further expand that differentiation in the space which has been so successful for us. So view Celergo as a technology addition that will enhance our service ability for many of these clients big or small, and broaden our depth and in particular kind of enhances our differentiation versus our competitors in that space. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I think the only thing I would add to that which is, I completely echo all those comments. I think in the prepared comments we made a comment that it still remains one of our biggest opportunities. So that's part of why we're excited. We're excited because of the quality of the acquisition and the team that we got and the product and the technology, but also because it's a large growth opportunity for us. So there's a large market out there, even though we are, I think, a market leader, there's still a lot more opportunity there. And obviously any time that we have the ability to go into and accelerate into markets that have big opportunities, that's exciting to us. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Kevin McVeigh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you very much. Hey, wonder if you could just give us a little more color on what allowed you to decrease the margin impact from the PEO on the ADP Indemnity side? It sounds like maybe it wasn't as bad as feared? Just a little more context on that. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Kevin, I appreciate the question. This has largely to do with our change in financial disclosures that we instituted for this fiscal year. Last year, and really in prior years, we undergo a process in which our workers' compensation indemnity evaluates the expected future losses that we have anticipated, and if there are changes to these expected future payments, we book adjustments. We historically have booked these adjustments in Other segment. And we changed now with our financial disclosures to include the results of indemnity into the PEO where they belong so that you have a true picture of the full performance of the PEO including these loss reserve adjustments that we book basically on a quarterly basis when warranted. And we had last year, a meaningful benefit for these loss reserve adjustments that created for us a grow-over pressure of 75 basis points, which we have not forecasted for the PEO when we gave guidance in August. And so the first quarter is now over, and we booked a loss reserve adjustment that was favorable and enhanced the results of the PEO. We had not put that into our guidance and now the results are better. So we let that positive expected loss reserve adjustment flow through and that basically adds to profit in the PEO sector. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah, so I think you made the comment that it wasn't as bad as you expected. To be clear what Jan is saying is, we had a big benefit in the first quarter of last year and we were worried about whether we would have that side \u2013 because you can't really forecast these things a year in advance which is why with good intentions, we used to have this in Other, to avoid exactly these discussions and these kind of ups and downs in the PEO segment. But I think we did come to the conclusion and we believe that it does belong in the PEO segment. We're putting it there. So now we have to, going forward, make sure we give you the appropriate amount of color so you understand what's happening. So this was in essence a large benefit and gain that we had through an adjustment of loss reserves in the first quarter of last year compared to a smaller gain this first quarter. But that smaller gain was bigger than what we anticipated, if that makes any sense. Kevin McVeigh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): No, it does. I apologize for the verbiage, it was more just I guess relative to the initial expectations of 50 basis points to 75 basis points, 50 basis points to 25 basis points. Awesome. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Nandan Amladi with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Nandan G. Amladi - Guggenheim Securities : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So at the June Investor Day, you talked about the early retirement plan being more successful, I guess a higher uptake than you were initially expecting. You've touched a little bit on the backfill plans. Can you describe a little bit more what your plans are for the remainder of the year for total head count and what areas of the business you're hiring in? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah. So I think one of the key words in some of the prepared comments we had, we used the word care in a few places and I just want to reemphasize that. That in June, if the implication that it was kind of more successful because it was more people. It's more successful from a financial standpoint, so on the spreadsheets it looks great. But we do have to execute on all these transformation efforts with care. We have to maintain high NPS scores and good execution. And so we, I think, adjusted our backfill plan based on the volume of uptake that we got. And also based on timing of the exits and which parts of the business were critical, it was critical for us to make sure that we had the right people in place to be able to handle the right volumes, especially at calendar year-end. And so saying all that, I think we had a plan that, as you can imagine, we would never have a voluntary early retirement program and then plan to backfill every single position. That would've not been I think probably a good use of our capital. And that was not what our intention was. So we thought that because of some of the work that we had been doing previously around transformation to take work out that we had an opportunity to, over the course of, call it 12 months, to offer this attractive package to some of our tenured associates. And it feels like it's working. And so if you think through what we've done is we hade three different waves of departures. And so they're scheduled to leave over different periods of time, over the 12 months since the date we announced the early retirement program. And we also had planned to backfill some of those positions over the same 12-month period of time. So what you're hearing in our comments is that that process, there was a plan around all that process and the one that we control the most is the departures. And that's exactly on track and on schedule. But in terms of the backfills, we were a little bit \"behind\" on the backfills which creates a short-term financial benefit that we saw in the first quarter. But if you roll forward and you look at our original plans which we're sticking to for the rest of the year, it creates not as big a benefit in the first quarter. Having said all that, we feel that when you look at the momentum in the PEO and Employer Services and other parts of our business, it gives us confidence in the performance of the business overall. So the first quarter financial performance was not solely and only because of this issue around the timing of backfills. It was one part and I would say it was a relatively small part. So we don't want to give you the wrong impression about our confidence in the future going forward, but we just wanted to make sure we clarified that we do have more backfills in the next few quarters than we had in the first quarter, and we think some of that was due to timing. If we feel like we've taken out more work than we thought we were able to take out, we might not have as many of the backfills as we had in the original plan. But for now, the most important thing for us to focus on is quality and year-end and NPS scores and client retention. And so we're not ready to come off of our original plans yet. Nandan G. Amladi - Guggenheim Securities : Thank you. Very helpful. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Just wanted to follow up on that. On Employer Services, besides hiring, is there any other additional reasons why the margins would drop back down to the fiscal year 2019 guidance range? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Again, another one we spent a lot of time talking about. I think that that's a fair question. One of the items is that one. I think that we have \u2013 the FX headwind is probably some part of it because we did have some FX benefit, just to clarify, even though we had a FX headwind on the revenue side, we had some FX benefit in the first quarter, as some of our costs that we have overseas went down faster than planned or more than what we had planned. Specifically, we have a large offshore operation in India, and I think that cost came in very favorable in the first quarter and well ahead of our plan. So I think there's probably a number of things that when you roll them together, including the fact that it's only the first quarter and so we're just not prepared \u2013 for example the strength that I mentioned in terms of improvement in concessions and pricing and so forth, if you roll those things forward and you assume they're going to continue, than we would expect a better second, third and fourth quarter. We're just not prepared this early in the year. And I think it's traditional for us. The fact that we raised our PEO guidance is unusual for us because \u2013 and I think it's prudent and I'm not sure what other companies do, but until we have more visibility and until we get to the calendar year-end \u2013 as a reminder, the next quarter, this quarter that we are in now today, is an important part of our new business bookings for the year and also December 31 represents an important measure of retention because clients tend to switch providers at that time of the year. So I think you should expect us coming out of the second quarter to have a stronger view and position. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. No. That's helpful. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: If I could add... Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Go ahead, Jan. Yeah. Go ahead. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I'm sorry. To add a few more comments of insights about the drivers of our margin expansion that may help you to do. And so part is that we hire in anticipation for our work, but we are also \u2013 I think as it turns out, the second half is not as good as the first half. And I think there is a little bit of this left in our asymmetry of margin that compares to prior years. So the second half is a little bit more difficult grow-over I think for us, and some of the success that we had with some of the initiatives that we initiated in the last half of the fiscal year. We had great scale, for example in our I&O organization. Our IT infrastructure is making progress and contributed. We had exceptional productivity improvements in our sales force for the start of the year, that would be not reasonable to assume that that type of level of productivity improvement is continuing throughout the year as we go through. So there are like some just natural business reasons that make you think as early in this fiscal year to kind of keep the margin expectations as we had them. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Got it. And then I wanted to ask about the U.S. outlook. ADP has a great look at the U.S. economy and currently lots of concern in the market. Are you guys seeing any cracks in the U.S. economy at this point? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Zero. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. All right. Well, that's a good sign. All right. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from David Grossman with Stifel Financial. Your line is open. David Michael Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp.: Thank you. Good morning. Carlos, maybe you could spend a little bit more time just on the upmarket. Obviously, we've been making some product modifications and you talked a little bit about sale strategies in the upmarket. Could you give us a little more detail in terms of where we are, not necessarily focusing on the quarter, but just kind of how you feel about that business and the progress that you're making? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Feeling really good about the progress that we're making there. I think we talked about, several quarters ago, the fact that we kind of more institutionalized our ability to sell Workforce Now in the lower end of the upmarket. Think 1,000 worksite employees to 3,000 worksite employees or 3,000 worksite employees to 5,000 worksite employees where we think that Workforce Now can really compete very strongly with certain parts of that segment. Whereas, Vantage can compete in that segment but competes even better in larger, more complex clients in the upmarket. So I think that adjustment in strategy has paid off. When you combine the new logo growth in the upmarket between Workforce Now and Vantage, I would say we're very pleased by the progress. And I think new logo growth, as you can hear in our comments, we're constantly talking about that because we love additional revenue from other products, we love incremental sales to existing clients, but the heart and soul of the strength of the business is market share and new logo growth. And I think on that metric, we're feeling good about the progress that we're making in the upmarket. It's still early days for some of the next-gen solutions that we're selling, but we're making some headway there also where we have a handful of clients. So clearly at our size and our scale, a handful of clients isn't making a difference on the numbers, but it's building confidence in both our sales force and in the marketplace. And so, by the way, we're also seeing really good progress in client satisfaction scores in the upmarket which I think are usually leading indicators of retention and also of new business bookings. And even if I look at the underlying revenue growth of that business, it's better than it was last year. We still have work to do, but we're feeling good about the progress. David Michael Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp.: And are there any milestone dates we should think about in terms of product enhancements or anything like that coming up? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Well not that we can share with you, because we've had some challenges with competitors saying things that are not accurate in the marketplace around our products and our strategy, which is a shame, because we usually try to take the high road. I won't mention who those competitors are, but I think it's not helpful for us to talk about specific dates, because we're trying to provide investors with transparency and clarity and so forth. And, unfortunately, some people take advantage of that situation. But I think at Investor Day we gave you a decent amount of information around what we were doing around Vantage and then also what our plans were in terms of our next-gen product. And I think I would probably refer back to that. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: And we're on plan and feeling good about those plans. David Michael Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp.: Okay. Got it. Thanks. And just one last one just in terms of you mentioned these changing employment models. And I know you've made some acquisitions there. But can you give us any sense of just how impactful, or the timing of when that really becomes an important competitive dynamic in the marketplace to have those capabilities? Or maybe it's happening right now, I don't know. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I mean I think that it's an important competitive dynamic right now. I think it helps our value proposition and our story which is part of the \u2013 what's important is the value proposition and the outcomes you deliver. I think on that front, given our scale and the size of these acquisitions, we haven't rolled these products out to 100% of our client base, or even to probably even 1% of our client base. But it does add to the strength of our sales force in terms of what they have as a value proposition in the marketplace. And medium to long term, I think we believe it's going to be a very significant enhancement. So I'd say in the short term, the biggest short-term benefit has been and probably will continue to be Global Cash Card because it's such an in-demand product and it's such a strong and good value proposition. And they're executing so well. And they were already somewhat large in comparison to some of the other acquisitions that we've made that I would say that's the one that has the most immediate short-term impact. But I think Celergo, WorkMarket and I'll even go back to TMBC, The Marcus Buckingham Company, all these acquisitions are big strengtheners to our value proposition and our ability to win share in the marketplace. David Michael Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp.: Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good results here. On the PEO, the 8% to 9% worksite employee growth, I'm curious, how would you benchmark that against industry growth for PEO \u2013 because we've had mixed reviews or mixed numbers, figures from the peer group. So I thought I'd ask you. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I would say that if you take the two numbers that you have that you're referring to and you average them, ours is higher. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Yeah. Simple math. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: The PEO industry has long-term growth that we shared with you in the Investor Day. And we are obviously aiming to be and getting back to all double digits, which has been a big discussion for us, in particular since the last quarter. And we're well on our way. And that would help us to drive market \u2013 continue our long story of market share gains. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: It's impressive, like this is a big PEO now, with a lot of worksite employees. And the number of new worksite employees that we have to sell each month and each quarter to generate the kind of growth rate that we just generated this quarter is impressive. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. You're the biggest player; that's not lost on us. Thanks for that. On the bookings, just to clarify. I know you've noted the tougher second half comps. Just curious, can you replenish the backlog and produce enough new sales and still land in that 6% to 8% zone in the second half of the year? I suppose mathematically you can go to 5%, 6% and still be at the low end. But I'm curious because it's such a big comp as the year progresses. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah, look, there's different selling seasons in our business, and different markets have different things. When I compare the first half of growth to our second half of growth, it looks pretty good. Not quite as good. We clearly recognize the fourth quarter is difficult, so we have a different thing, but the confidence in the sales force to achieve the overall plan, which has obviously helped us to establish our guidance, is high, so. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: We're definitely not trying to manage to the full year number. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: No. We want to go as fast as we can. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: I mean, our goal would be to do what you just described, which is we want to outperform and not just get what we need in order to meet the forecast. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Understood. Thanks for the time. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question is from James Berkley with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. James Robert Berkley - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, guys. Congrats on the quarter, and thanks for squeezing me in. Just a quick follow-up on an earlier PEO question. Do you see any risk to your 11% to 14% medium term guidance? I assume there's no reason to back off of that given the strength you're seeing now. And could you quantify maybe in growth or basis point terms what the headwind is that you saw or are seeing still from some extent from the incentive changes and then the ACA related downgrades and other factors you mentioned on last quarter's call, just so we can get a feel? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah. Let me tie this back to the long term outlook that we gave in our Investor Day. There are two main factors that I would think about this as related to achieving our revenue targets for the PEO in the longer term. One is a thing that we don't control which is the growth of our zero margin pass-through revenue growth, which is actually the biggest factor. And so we have changes in healthcare inflation, changes in participation rates and the health insurance rate that are driven by industry dynamics that we don't control. And so that trend had shown some pressure in the last fiscal year and is ongoing really, if we think so. So that will put pressure on that long term goal. It will have zero economic impact to ADP, but so from that I think that's a pressure that we would have acknowledged and that is there for the revenue number. But for the bottom line number, it would have no impact. And then the second component is clearly what we have been focusing on in this call which is the drive of our worksite employee growth, which is of course a factor of our sales execution as well as our retention. And we feel optimistic that our sales force has enough potential to sell these new clients even though the scale is big and is hard work. But the increased momentum in the last two quarters of our sales gives us optimism that the model reacts to it. And you saw that we are upticking our worksite employee and revenue growth already after couple of quarters of good sales success. So that works for us, and it has been aided also by very good retention particularly this quarter in the PEO. So those factors drive the revenue growth more than anything that we control, and we have a lot of focus on the management team on it. So I think we, aside from that pass-through pressure that I really don't work to offset here in order to make the revenue number, we feel good about the strategic outlook of the PEO. James Robert Berkley - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thanks. And then just lastly, on the multinational side I think you said it grew low double digits in the quarter. I don't know if you possibly could just kind of size that and what you think maybe the TAM is for that? And talk about your recent acquisitions and the potential for that to maybe accelerate? And just kind of your plans in the international market or multinational space in general? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Yeah. For a very long time, our multinational solutions have really grown in the mid-teens very consistently, and those are our plans. We execute, and there's really no change in our outlook. I think the Celergo thing is just another component if you think in the longer term that drives our differentiation, will enhance our opportunities for an ambitious growth rate. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: And I think the TAM is large. We have it somewhere in the data that I get, but I honestly can't remember offhand. But when you look at our market share and you look at the size of the market, I think we actually may have even had it in our Investor Day materials if you want to go back and refer to it. But one of the things that Jan mentioned in his comments \u2013 he used the term multicountry payroll. So we have these multinational solutions which are \u2013 in some cases, we're referring to very large companies that are in 15, 20 countries, but there also are a lot of companies that are operating in two or three countries, maybe in France but you have two other countries in Europe or a couple countries in Asia and they may be midsize companies. So the TAM is also something that is probably growing over time as people realize that the market is actually bigger than what we thought. So I think if you talk to our international leaders, they would say that this was very, very crucial because of the size of that multicountry payroll market that was underserved. So we're hoping that that opens up new opportunity as well. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: And just to state the obvious, in this market our clients are not only HCM clients of ourself, but we partner a lot with ERP systems and large ERP vendors for clients who choose to partner with us on a multicountry payroll solution. So the market size that we address really spans a variety of client types which allows us really a longer sustained revenue growth. James Robert Berkley - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks a lot. Great quarter. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude our Q&A portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: So thank you very much for your questions today. As you probably could tell, we're off to a really good start. Even though we have a lot to accomplish still, we're very pleased with the progress that we've made. I also want to thank our associates because besides having our investors embrace change in our transformation, I think it can't happen without the support of our associates and our leaders. So I really appreciate the support we're getting internally as we drive our transformation so that we create, as Jan just referred to, a long and sustainable revenue growth for another 70 years. So next \u2013 I believe it's next June, we actually reach our 70 birthday and we didn't get here by not making it through multiple changes in technology and economic cycles. And this transformation effort is intended to position us to be successful for another 70 years. So I think we're well on our way to doing that, at least positioning ourselves for the 70 years, not the actual 70 years, but we appreciate the support of all of our stakeholders including all of you but also our associates in what has obviously been a very fast-changing environment for us. So with that, I will thank you once again and appreciate your continued interest in ADP. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Daniel, and I'll be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Second Quarter Fiscal 2019 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and- answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Christian Greyenbuhl, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Christian Greyenbuhl : Thank you, Daniel, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining ADP's Second Quarter Fiscal 2019 earnings call and Webcast. With me today are Carlos Rodriguez, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, our Chief Financial Officer. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. These materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the quarterly investor presentation that accompanies today's call, as well as our quarterly history of revenue in pretax earnings by reportable segment. During our call today, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items in the second quarter and full year of fiscal 2019 as well as the second quarter and full year of fiscal 2018. A description of these items and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release. Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such, involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. As always, please do not hesitate to reach out should you have any questions. And with that, let me turn the call over to Carlos. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you, Christian and thank you, everyone for joining our call. This morning we reported our second quarter fiscal 2019 results with revenue of $3.5, billion up 8% on both reported and organic constant currency basis. We are pleased with this revenue growth which was slightly above our expectations and which was aided in part by the continued strength of our employer services down market and multinational solutions and our PEO. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 30% to a $1.34 and benefited from our strong revenue growth, as well as adjusted EBIT margin expansion, lower adjusted effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding. Our results this quarter continue to highlight the underlying strength of our business model, as we continue to experience the benefits of operating efficiencies enabled by our ongoing transformation efforts. We also continue to see improvements in our cost base across our businesses and back office functions. We remain excited with the progress of our investments in technology, including our next-gen solutions and we are also pleased with the performance of our recent acquisitions. As we continue our efforts to accelerate our investments to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our products and services, we also continue to see improvements in our overall client satisfaction scores. With these positive trends across our businesses, we are reaffirming our expectation of 25 to 50 basis points of improvement in ES revenue retention for fiscal 2019. Moving on to employer services new business bookings, this quarter we saw bookings growth below our expectations with 1% growth for the quarter, that can happen some years the timing of the December holidays and our own selling calendar played a larger than anticipated role which resulted in a number of deals particularly within the mid and upmarket pushing into the third fiscal quarter. While, we see a similar pattern from time to time the impact this year was a bit more pronounced than typical. And it's also important to remember that new business bookings has inherent variability quarter-to-quarter. With that said, we continue to see strong bookings performance in our downmarket, multinational and HRO businesses. And our largely pleased with our product positioning win rates and overall sales strategy. For these reasons, despite the lower than expected growth this quarter, we are maintaining our forecast of 6% to 8% ES New Business Bookings growth for fiscal 2019. Now, I would like to expand on my earlier comments regarding the progress of our transformation initiatives and then touch on some strategic and operational business highlights. First, looking internally, as we discussed at our June 2018 Investor Day, we have launched a number of initiatives across the organization with the objective of enhancing both our operating efficiency and our go to market strategy. As you can see from this quarter's results, our efforts to streamline our operations, while also enhancing the client experience are paying off. We are clearly seeing the benefits of these transformation efforts help our overall margin performance. In addition, we feel good about the progress we are making, as we transform our service and we continue to see broad based positive trends in our client satisfaction scores, which for some of our businesses are now at record high levels. I am pleased with what we have achieved to date and with our ability to remain on track as we tackle various competing demands. I'm especially proud of our associates are helping us manage through these change initiatives in a thoughtful and careful way. Now, moving on to an area of key strategic differentiation, our leading data analytics and benchmarking solution, ADP DataCloud. As a world of work evolves and companies and their employees increasingly demand greater access to timely and insightful data, we believe that ADP is well-positioned to leverage our broad based HCM dataset to further empower our clients' front-line managers and key decision makers. With these capabilities in mind, we recently expanded the use of ADP DataCloud to deepen our relationship with key distribution channel partners. One example of this is through our current CPA centric data product, Accountant Connect which gives CPA the ability to see their clients' payroll reports, tax forms and notifications, while also providing them with a central practice management tools, all in one place. We are always looking for new ways to leverage the strength of our data and the breadth of our HCM services to generate additional opportunities for growth. And at the beginning of November, we announced an exciting new partnership with Intuit, which now further strengthens the services we offer to accounts. Through this initiative, we have expanded our integration with QuickBooks adding an enhanced general ledger interface that maps directly through Accountant Connect. This new cloud based interface combines the financial and transactional capabilities of QuickBooks with a deep data pool available through ADPs DataCloud and will help accountant save time while also providing access to award winning compensation insights to help improve their client's business, as we head into tax season. We are proud to be able to provide product and insights like these to our clients to further empower them. Last week, we were equally proud to be selected as one of Fortune magazine's world's most admired companies for the 13th consecutive year. I am pleased that our efforts have been consistently recognized especially, as we make steady progress on our transformation amid dynamic business environment. It is an honor to once again be among the most admired companies in the world and this is a testament to the commitment of our associates, clients and partners to drive innovation, as we work together to change the world of work. Overall, we are pleased with our progress and remained confident in our long term strategy as we continue our efforts to deliver on our transformation initiatives. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jan, for his commentary on the second quarter results and fiscal 2019 outlook. Jan Siegmund : Thank you, Carlos and good morning everyone. Our consolidated revenue this quarter was $3.5 billion, up 8% on a reported and organic constant currency basis. And as Carlos said, this was slightly ahead of our own expectations. This quarter, we continue to experience the incremental benefit from the sales momentum we generated last year, as well as the steady improvement in the performance of our PEO. The PEO results were particularly strong in part due to better contribution from benefits, workers compensation and SUI revenue than we had anticipated, but there was also an unrelated pull forward in SUI revenue from the third quarter which I will discuss in more detail in a few moments. Our earnings before income taxes and adjusted EBIT both increased 26%; adjusted EBIT margin was up about 320 basis points compared to last year's second quarter and included 30 basis points of pressure from acquisitions. This margin improvement was ahead of our expectation and benefited from a few key drivers. In addition to the solid performance from our revenue growth and operating leverage, this quarter we also benefited slightly from lower growth in our distribution expenses, as a result of lower than expected second quarter new business bookings performance. With that said, we also continue to benefit from the execution on efficiencies efforts within our IT infrastructure and to our broader transformation initiatives including our voluntary early retirement program. As we mentioned last quarter, we have continued to benefit from a slower ramp in our backfill hiring related to the voluntary early retirement program. And we expect some of the benefit to moderate over the back half of the year. As a result, while we continue to estimate a run rate of about $150 million in savings from this program, we now anticipate achieving slightly more than our original estimate of $100 million of benefit in fiscal year 2019. As Carlos mentioned, we're executing on a number of different initiatives and the timing of costs or benefit can move around from quarter-to-quarter, and as a reminder, as we proceed and refine our plans, the impact of some of these initiatives may overlap but ultimately our focus remains to deliver against the multi-year commitments we laid out at our June 2018 Investor Day, our adjusted effective tax rate was 24.6% and included a small benefit from the unplanned stock compensation tax benefits. This tax rate compared to over 25.6% adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter of last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 30% to $1.34 and in addition to benefiting from our strong revenue and margin performance and our lower tax rate was also supported by fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. Now for our segment results. For Employer Services, revenues grew 7% for the quarter, 7% organic constant currency and we were ahead of expectations. Retention is improving in line with expectations and we continue to see the benefits from last year stronger than expected new business bookings. Each contributing to our stronger than expected revenue performance this quarter. Our revenue growth in our international businesses which we now disclose quarterly in our Form 10-Q was also strong this quarter, and was aided by a solid double digit growth in our multinational offerings which continued to do very well. Interest income on client funds grew 21% and benefited from a 30 basis point improvement in the average yield earned on our client fund investments and the growth in average client funds balances of 5% compared to a year ago. This growth in balances was driven by a combination of client growth, wage inflation and growth in our pays per control, offset by pressure from corporate tax reform and lower state unemployment insurance collections. As a reminder, we had some pressure on our client fund balance growth related to the corporate tax reform that we now fully lapped, but other sources of pressure like SUI rate changes and FX will put added pressure on our balance growth for the remainder of the year. Our same store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.3% for the quarter. Moving onto Employer Services margin. We saw an increase of about 460 basis points in the quarter which include approximately 50 basis points of pressure from the impact of the acquisitions. This very strong performance is a result of the same factors I mentioned earlier regarding our consolidated results including operating leverage across all of our businesses, efficiencies and our IT infrastructure, slower growth in our selling expenses and the impact of our transformation initiatives which continue to help in improving our underlining efficiency. Our PEO revenues grew 12% in the quarter and PEO revenues excluding zero-margin benefits pass-throughs grew 15% both above our expectations. Average worksite employees increased 9% to 545,000. We were pleased to see continued solid performance of our worksite employee growth in particular with some signs of normalization and retention compared to the pressure that we had seen last year among our larger PEO clients. For revenue, the outperformance was attributable to two factors. First, we saw favorability and benefits workers compensation and SUI revenue relative to our expectations which is not unusual and it's part of our normal variability. Second, as I mentioned earlier, there was a pull forward in a portion of our SUI revenue this quarter which benefited our total PEO revenue growth rate by about 200 basis points. And this will therefore come out of next quarter's PEO growth, yielding no net impact for the full year. The PEO segments margin increased 70 basis points for the quarter, and benefited from operating leverage and selling efficiencies partially offset by the grow over pressure from adjustments to our loss reserve estimates related to ADP Indemnity. Now onto our fiscal year 2019 outlook. For Employer Services, we are increasing our revenue guidance to 5% to 6% from our previous guidance of 4% to 6% with two quarters now coming in the head of expectations, we feel better about our position for the year, but we continue to anticipate a deceleration in the back half driven in part by a combination of the impacts of this quarter's new business bookings performance incremental pressure from FX and the lapping of certain acquisitions. We continue to anticipate growth of 2.5% in our pays per control metric. Finally due to our margin outperformance this quarter we are raising our ES margin outlook and now anticipate full year ES margins to expand 175 basis points to 200 basis points from our prior forecast of 150 basis points to 175 basis points. Our look also continues to contemplate 50 basis points from acquisition drag for the year. Moving on to the PEO, we now expect 9% to 10% PEO revenue growth in fiscal year 2019 compared to our prior forecast of an 8% to 9%. And we continue to expect 8% to 9% growth in average worksite employees. We now anticipate 8% to 9% growth in PEO revenues excluding zero-margin benefit pass routes, as we have been realizing better workers compensation and SUI revenues relative to our prior expectations. For our PEO margins with better than expected performance in our PEO margin this quarter, we now expect margins to be at least flat compared to our prior forecast the decrease of down 50 basis points to 25 basis points. And meanwhile we continue to anticipate grow over pressure from adjustments to our loss reserve estimates related to ADP Indemnity to result in 50 basis points of grow over pressure on a full year basis unchanged from our prior forecast. Moving on to the consolidated outlook, we continue to anticipate total revenue growth of 6% to 7% for fiscal year 2019. We now expect the growth in average client fund balances to be about 4% compared to our prior forecast of up 3% to 4%. And we continue to expect growth in our client fund interest revenue of $90 million to $100 million and for the total impact from the client funds extended investment strategy to be an increase of $70 million to $80 million. The details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. We now anticipate our adjusted EBIT margin to expand 125 basis points to 150 basis points compared to our prior forecast of 100 basis points to 125 basis points driven by the strong execution that we have seen so far this year. This outlook continues to include approximately 30 basis points of pressure from acquisitions. With that said, as you can see our guidance implies a slower pace of margin expansion in the latter half of fiscal year 2019 as we continue to expect lower top line revenue growth, while we at the same time maintaining our investments into the business and continue to catch up on our back feel hiring plans related to our voluntary early retirement program. With the impact of the first half stock compensation related tax benefit. We are tweaking our adjusted effective tax rate expectation to 24.4% in fiscal year 2019 as compared to our prior estimate of 24.5%. And with these adjustments to our outlook, we now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to grow 17% to 19% from our prior forecast of 15% to 17%. We continue to be pleased with our overall execution. And with that, I will turn it back to the operator to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is now open. MarkMarcon: Good morning. Congratulations on the strong results. I am wondering if you can talk a little bit about, what you think is the sustainability of the margin improvement that you've seen particularly in light of the catch up not for the remainder of this year, but just as we think a little bit beyond this year? That's the first question. And then the second question would just be you're seeing an improvement with regards to your retention rate. Can you talk about how much of that do you think is due to the service center consolidation versus maybe leveraging some of the enhanced assets that you have such as the data cloud? Thank you. CarlosRodriguez: Thank you for the question. I think on the sustainability front, I think that just kind of refer you back to Jan's comment about remaining committed to the commitments we made at our 2018 Investor Day, where I think we laid out multi-year -- I think commitments around margin expansion. So I refer you back to that because it's again we want to kind of stick to the -- that we normally do things here which is we provide guidance one year at a time, but I think that will give you some sense of, I think our expectations of what the business is capable of doing over multiple years. MarkMarcon: You did Carlos. So just, you're outperforming this year and so I didn't know if that outperformance this year would thereby potentially impact kind of the cadence on a go-forward basis? If that make sense. CarlosRodriguez: Well, I appreciate that. So let me -- let me again go back to maybe some of the things that Jan was -- I think talking about in his comments that are important probably a good thing for us to talk about on the call today. We are committed to the -- I guess the outcomes that we talked about in June of 2018, but we're also committed to doing it in a thoughtful and careful manner which is the way, I described in my comments around this transformation effort that we are undergoing here what that means is that as an example in the case of this service alignment initiative or the voluntarily retirement these are fairly large projects that affect a lot of people and a lot of parts of the business, and frankly we're in both cases we're doing these things for the first time. And so we have plans and we have contingency plans and we have plans on top of the plans and then what we do is we react to them, the circumstances and I think what's happened here as Jan described is, -- it worked out great on a spreadsheet that we were going to backfill a certain percentage of the people who were in voluntarily retirement and I just want to point out that we, even though it was good for associates and it was good for the company we did lose a lot of knowledge and experience as a result of this voluntarily retirement and it was important to plan carefully around that and to make sure that we continued to execute around client service and the other things that are important to maintain retention and other parts of the business. It's not just about cost cutting, it's about strengthening the business and what that means is that sometimes you get that a little bit, and it's not perfect, the perfect signs in terms of the spreadsheets, and I think we really got a lot of benefit in the first and second quarter that we didn't anticipate. So we're just trying to be transparent here in the sense that I'm very committed to making sure that besides achieving the cost reduction goals, which we clearly have, that we also continue to achieve the client service, the associate satisfaction and the retention goals that we also have that are incredibly important to the sustainability, back to your sustainability point. So I could probably give a lot of other details on things that helped us in the quarter, but I think I would just have us -- I would bring us back to kind of our longer-term commitments and I think our public commitments around the 2018 Investor Day and as excited as we are about the quarter, I don't think that it fundamentally changes. It's hard enough to be excited. I mean, that was -- its a great quarter, clearly we done an incredible -- made an incredible progress at our cost structure while still improving our client satisfaction scores, while still improving retention. There's a lot to like in the quarter, but we're here to try to build a long term sustainable successful business and that means that we have to do it in a thoughtful and careful manner. One of things that I've been very worried about is making sure that we are backfilling at an appropriate rate to maintain those client satisfaction scores. JanSiegmund: And maybe Mark, I take the retention question. I would point you to two things. So some of our broader product portfolio helps us data cloud certainly and attach rates to that, adding value to our clients, but the two most impact points that I can see is, a, the client satisfaction and client service scores really nice -- developed nicely and we see a strong correlation between client satisfaction net promoter scores and retention. So service has been really stable and improving over time and there is a very broad based improvement in our NPL scores in the business. And secondly, maybe a little bit more detail. As you know, we finished and finalized the upgrading of our major account client pace, which had put pressure onto our retention rates and now with our clients being on the current workforce. Now we have seen really for many quarters now a steady improvement in the retention rates as we grow over the impact of that migration effort. Those are probably the two most important factors that have driven the good retention this year -- this quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. TientsinHuang: Hi. Thanks, good results here. I just want to clarify the margin again if you don't mind. How much of the raise was due to the transformation initiative, the retirement savings coming sooner than expected or just finding more savings than originally expected. May be can you go through those numbers, again, Jan? JanSiegmund: Yes. It's a little bit hard to completely decompose every source of margin expansion because the fundamental source of our productivity is growing our labor force slower than revenues. And so we have a number of factors and initiatives that drive towards that. We had an early retirement program that helped, but we had also for example an IT infrastructure fundamental reorganization that improved the processes. We have reduced call volumes. The Transformation Office has really a myriad up initiatives that all really aim for the same thing driving labor productivity if you want because that's our business model, we are highly labored, we're not capital intensive and so we're focusing on our big cost log of labor productivity. And so that's number one. So, these initiatives are, it's really academic to isolate them because they overlap in the thinking. And number two, as we did see in the second quarter and I think we tried to indicate that in the first quarter also that catch up on the refill has been a little bit slower and that's not because we wanted it to be slower, but it is -- it has -- just happened that way and the execution which benefited the margin but is really not where we wanted the business to come out. So I think in my comments I said we're estimating the full range of VERP impact to be still $150 million on a run rate basis but split the middle here kind of -- let's say it's maybe $120 million this year of impact of VERP if that's helpful. TientsinHuang: Versus the 100 before. Okay. And then just one quick follow-up on the bookings side, I understood that there was a little bit of slippage on those deals since closed and that what's giving you confidence that you can still deliver the 6% to 8% because we all know that the top -- comps have been tough and you've been clear about that. So just to better understand your confidence there. Thank you. CarlosRodriguez: So I think that we do have some visibility obviously into what's happening in January here. And I think that one of the things that I mentioned in my comments was the calendar and it's a little -- it's not -- it's little embarrassing because we did have a little bit of a miss in our planning process of some changes in the calendar that moved the number of selling days from year-over-year. So as an example last year the way the calendar fell we had a number of days around the holidays that were -- with that this year we didn't have in terms of ability to sell. And so I think that gives us some comfort that we had some movement from one quarter to the other because, we do have some visibility into the January results. So I think some of it is pure calendar, but again at the risk of -- we don't want to be the company that talks about weather causing issues. Now, this is in a weather issue but calendars are also something that you have to be careful, its a slippery slope of always blaming the calendar and we typically wouldn't even bring it up but, it was pretty clear as we laid out started looking after the quarter ended at the calendar that we had an issue from a planning standpoint and we didn't anticipate that and hence we didn't communicate it to us. Since, we didn't know -- we didn't figure it out, we didn't communicate it externally. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is now open. RamseyElAssal: Hi, thanks for taking my question. So just to be clear, the implication is that on the booking side, the deceleration this quarter was really more due to the calendar and to timing. So should we anticipate next quarter kind of a snap back to a healthier level? CarlosRodriguez: That's a good follow up question, which I can't answer because, we only have one month done. As I was trying to give as much color without breaking our protocol of -- we provide guidance once a year, we don't provide quarterly guidance and we've really don't talk about the quarter that we're in the middle of now. So I think I would just refer you back to our confirmation of our 6% to 8% guidance for ES New Business Bookings which I think gives you some sense that we anticipate that the third quarter will have some bounce back because that's a mathematical, I'm not providing any change in guidance. But I also would caution you that February and March are still in front of us. RamseyElAssal: Fair enough. I wanted to ask also about the early retirement program and the backfill hiring, could you give us any incremental kind of color commentary on whether the early retirement, the folks who opted in for early retirement, where they localized in any particular part of the organization. Is there any -- is a slowdown in the backfill hiring related to the fact that there were certain skills maybe that left the organization that are sort of more difficult to bring back in or is it just was it broad based. Any additional color there would be helpful? CarlosRodriguez: It's a great -- good question. I think one of the challenges from a planning standpoint on a voluntarily retirement program which for the record is the first time ADP does it. So not making excuses but we don't have a ton of experience in terms of, we tried to talk to experts and other folks to help us anticipate what the take rate would be and in what areas and so forth, but there is a certain amount of uncertainty, just because it's voluntary and so it was not -- it's impossible for us to predict exactly where it was going to end up happening. I would say that it was, as you would expect, it was broad based since it is Voluntary Early Retirement Program and our associate tenure and experience tends to be spread across the entire organization. So I think it was, there may have been one or two places where there was a little bit more a higher percentage than in other areas in terms of the take rate, but, I think in general it was broad based geographically and broad based by function and by business unit, with slight variability within and so, the real issue here has been our inability to predict how quickly we would be able to backfill those positions. There is no other kind of problem or underlying issue other than we've never done this before and we anticipated and put in the plan and communicated in our guidance, a certain pace and we've not been able to achieve that pace. And I think, the final comment, I will make on that is, it feels to me like that has been strictly a question of execution on the hiring itself, but, as Jan said, some of it could be, since there's no scientific way to parse all of these different factors, the business has been performing very well. Jan mentioned that we have had reductions in call volumes, we have had improved -- we are confirming our guidance on retention, so you can see that we're feeling good about the progress around retention. So, all of those things I think, ease the pressure to backfill quickly. So, it's probably a combination of the execution on the backfills and the business is just performing better and we just need to wait a couple more quarters to -- I think let that all play out. But our plan currently is to try to catch up as we mentioned in our comments on some of that backfill hiring to make sure that we have the right number of implementation people and service people to maintain the high client satisfaction scores. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. JamesFaucette: Great, thank you, very much. I wanted to just ask a quick follow up question on the bookings from the previous quarter. Clearly, the calendar played a big role, but, are you seeing any other implications from whether it be the weakness in the overall -- in the stock market or governments shut down in the month of January. That was having any impact on bookings activity, at all that you could be perhaps attributable to something other than the calendar. And then, also as for as, I wanted to touch on acquisitions and that's obviously been part of ADP strategy for a while. So just an update on how Celergo acquisition is going, that integration and any surprises that you've seen either for better or worse. Thank you. CarlosRodriguez: I'll let Jan talk about the acquisitions, but on the topic of kind of general environment and the impact on our New Business Bookings, we usually have some, I guess anecdotal stories and I'm sure some people in our Salesforce will take some exception because they probably heard some noise around uncertainty and government shutdown and so forth. But, I think that, based on the experience, I have, which we haven't been in so many cycles, that I have an infinite amount of experience but it doesn't feel like there is a major factor at least in our business results. And again I hate to keep going back to our January results. We typically don't talk about our results in the current quarter but it feels more like a calendar issue than an issue around shutdown or the economy or the stock market it has to have some impact somewhere especially on a few larger deals. Larger companies tend to become a little bit more cautious in pulling their horns when they see trouble on the horizon. But you saw our ADP National Employment Report this morning, you see other factors out there that indicate a slowing of growth and a slowing of positive trends, but not anything that smells or feels to us like a major economic slowdown. So I would have to say that we have yet to see anything of the sort that would lead us to believe that there's something happening in the general environment. There has to be at least one or two large deals where maybe some specific industries, a couple of large companies decided to maybe delay a decision or one up but it hasn't gotten to my level, I haven't heard about that yet. JanSiegmund: And just as an add on, and a reminder ADP has really no exposure to servicing the federal government in our services so we had also zero impact on the shutdown relative to our services, because we don't serve the federal government in any meaningful way. Number two is Celergo, just as a reminder Celergo was an acquisition that we -- is augmenting our multinational offerings, strengthening what is already a very differentiated service that we have and it's performing really well. So we had no surprises on the negative side relative to the product and the software it will become our go forward platform for all of our services in the streamlined business portion of our multinational thing, the pipeline is strong and we're ahead of our own business case so we're really pleased with that acquisition. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. JimSchneider: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, first of all not to beat a dead horse on the bookings front but can you maybe talk about the new business environment and the selling season as it relates to the kind of competitive environment you're seeing both on the mid-market and upmarket, as well as on the down where you've been executing very well. Maybe talk about whether anything is really changing from a competitive or pricing standpoint that may be affecting any deal closures or whether you still have confidence as related to calendar thing? CarlosRodriguez: I think the mid-market and the upmarket remain highly competitive, which I think we've talked about in prior quarters, but it's no different than it has been in any other quarters. So again back to beating the dead horse, I think that we feel like there are some other issues that I think may have led to the weakness in terms of our bookings because the competitive environment seems to be consistently competitive. I was in Atlanta last week meeting with some salespeople and to try to get some firsthand -- again a exposure to the things that we're encountering out in the marketplace in the mid-market the upmarket and I also talked to some folks in the down market and I feel -- we feel good about our product lineup. We feel good as we always have about our excellent sales force and their ability to execute and I think we feel despite some of the noise in the system we feel pretty good about where the economy is. So it's hard really to pinpoint anything specific around competition or the economy or anything else to give you any additional color. I wish there was something that we could point to concretely so that we can then deal with it, but there's really nothing that we see in our way of being able to continue to achieve our objectives. JanSiegmund: I think maybe a little bit more detail maybe too much sausage making here, but number one is you will recall that we in the last few quarters strengthened our enterprise segments offering by also now offering workforce now into the enterprise space, and that's a strategic move that has played out well and has resulted in a nice new logo growth for the enterprise space. So we're very pleased with that progress that we have been making and another comment regarding pricing, actually I think the more broader discounting and also credits declines, all indicators of the health of the business have been improving in the quarter. I think largely driven also by an improvement in the service quality that's now starting to resonate in the market and helping also sales. So there's a bunch of positive things kind of underlining helping a little bit. JimSchneider: That's helpful. And then I guess on the flip side of it, you continued to raise your revenue guidance and obviously I'm guessing that a big part of that is better retention even though you don't -- do for the quarterly but is it fair to say that you would expect given everything you just said on the call about clients satisfaction that you'll be biased towards the upper end of their retention guidance for the full year? CarlosRodriguez: No, I think you have -- yes we have a lot of optimism about our business and about the progress but we really do try to hit it down the fairway in terms of our guidance. We really do have issues around FX in the second half. I mean we have -- FX could change because we can't predict what rates are going to be at the end of the third quarter, but based on what we know today we're going to have some FX headwinds. We have some acquisitions that we lap and we have specific things that we anticipate will slow our revenue growth a little bit as we've mentioned in the comments. So we really -- it's hard to get these things all 100% correct, but we give you what we know. JimSchneider: Fair enough. Thank you. CarlosRodriguez: And also sorry one more just because it's a fairly important one. I think Jan touched on it and we haven't really got a question about it yet, which by the way I appreciate it is complicated but the PEO did have an unusual -- and usually strong quarter in terms of its growth rate as a result of this kind of SUI pull forward which, that real sausage making and it really flips around in the third quarter, so there's really no change. It's just a timing issue that we pulled some revenues into the second quarter versus the third. It's really an accounting issue and I wouldn't spend a lot of time on it, but it is important to know that so that you don't multiply times four because that is definitely a very isolated and very identifiable benefit to the second quarter that we did not get in the third or the fourth. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is now open. SamadSamana: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So Carlos I think you mentioned in a couple of times that the company hasn't been able to achieve the backfill ramp as expected. I'm curious is the company struggling to attract talent or is there something that, that is in ADP's control as far as not being able to back them up fast enough or is it that we're on a tight labor market and you're having trouble hiring, I guess maybe a double click on that for a little bit and for us a little bit and then how reliant is your guidance for the rest of the year on backfilling or catching up on this backfill, and is there some point where your guidance is at risk? CarlosRodriguez: Yes, I think I tried it in my comments. So it's maybe didn't come across clearly in terms of second half of my comments, but I don't think it's a matter of that we haven't been able to. I think I spent a few minutes also talking about how it's possible that we didn't need to and it's just hard to know at this point in time how much scientifically is one thing versus the other. The improvements we've had in client satisfaction, the reduction in call volumes, the improvements in business execution all of those things take off pressure in terms of the immediacy of the need to backfill and so that could be a factor in that. So I'm not ready to say that we have been unable to attract people and backfill, we hire thousands of people per year because we -- like all companies have a natural rate of turnover as a result of normal retirements and also just people departing for other opportunities. So again I'm not going to get into the sausage making in terms of how many people we hire every year but suffice to say that's thousands of people and we're talking about here in terms of backfills is in the hundreds. So absolutely not a factor that we can't attract talent. SamadSamana: Great. And maybe just one follow up on the product side. You mentioned doing workforce now into the enterprise as well and we've heard some feedback that the company is no longer actively selling Vantage, is that something that's -- that's happening where workforce now is replacing Vantage as well in the enterprise focus then. And is that leading to any kind of change and maybe the buying patterns in the enterprise where you saw some of those deal push out? Thanks again for taking my questions. CarlosRodriguez: We saw the, after getting some extra help and doing some analysis on market needs. We saw the workforce in our opportunity in the up market as really an incremental opportunity in a segment of the market that we weren't serving, as well as we could with Vantage and some of the other solutions that we have. So the answer is no. We're still serving Vantage in the market. It tends to be to a higher average sized client that's slightly more complex and the workforce in our solution tends to be a slightly smaller average sized client -- slightly less complex within the enterprise space. So I'm talking -- these are all large clients. So I'm talking all about the up market but there are just different segments of the upmarket and I think Jan mentioned that based on our logo growth we have some sense that it's incremental. We're not going to get into details of how much is one versus the other but I think, overall, it feels like the pie got a little bit bigger by us selling workforce now. We always -- we've been selling workforce now for many years but our -- I think our level of execution and focus on that was not as high as it's been in the last call it 12 to 18 months. And it seems to be working very, very well particularly against certain competitors. JanSiegmund: We continue to invest into Vantage, so absolutely Vantage is part of the lineup in our enterprise space among workforce now and global view and streamline for that for multinational solutions so. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. JasonKupferberg: Hey, thanks guys. I'm so obviously a lot of focus on bookings here. I was hoping you could give us some of the -- just forward revenue sensitivity to a 1% change in bookings growth. I feel like in the past you had talked about some of those kinds of rules that's found there? JanSiegmund: About $15 million in revenue. Remember that, clearly if this is a timing issue from quarter-to-quarter it's really not that big of a deal for us longer term because retention is a bigger driver. I think retention is 4x the impact or 1% of retention; it's a much bigger number. It's $50 million to $60 million. Sorry, 5x the impact I am being told. So that's why, from a business execution standpoint we have to have our new business bookings grow overtime at the rate that we have put out there in order to grow the business overall, but the retention rate is which we haven't gotten many questions about is equally -- if not more important and we experienced that firsthand two or three years ago, we've now fixed that, very proud of it. I'll try and take a little bit of credit right here. JasonKupferberg: Okay. That makes sense. And I was just curious on the downmarket bookings in the ES, I think you did highlight that as a bright spot, do you feel like you're taking share down market with new business creation particularly strong, Salesforce productivity? CarlosRodriguez: Little bit of -- I think all of the above. I think that we have, our down market business also includes our insurance services business that includes our retirement business or 401(k) business and also includes; we have some time in attendance products, so it's really broad based. I think it's just a business that has again been executing exceptionally well after having gotten any much more simplified environment following the upgrades to our new platform run several years ago, they've just continued to create positive momentum and have been incredibly competitive in the marketplace, and I can't point to any one factor but some of the things we've talked about around Accountant Connect and the partner, to work with the partners and the channels I mean all those things are blocking and tackling in the trenches and they've just done a terrific job. JanSiegmund: The SBS business is, I think, just crossed 600,000 clients on run, so they're celebrating a big milestone for them. JasonKupferberg: Okay. That's helpful. Just one last quick one, you talked about some of the factors driving slower revenue growth in the second half and currency and M&A lapping we're obviously part of the call out there, but I don't know its kind of underlying organic constant currency basis, how much detail should we be thinking about it, I know you had the SUI pull forward, so that'll impact PEO, but outside of that, are there any meaningful factors? CarlosRodriguez: Again that that really does get into the real sausage making. I'm not sure that -- other than some of the highlights that we've given you, what other stuff we can get down to that level of detail, other than kind of helping you with the math in terms of probably better to focus on first half versus second half. Jan probably has a couple of other things that he could add. But I would encourage you, again, because there's variability from quarter-to-quarter, to at least look at it on half versus half -- first half versus second half. JanSiegmund: Yes. I'm trying to -- I'm looking at the factors there like, a lot of ups and downs here, but the FX impact, obviously, we isolated the biggest ones that are different from the first half versus the second half. So I think I'm looking here. The FX headwind pressure for our revenue is about 0.5%, we're expecting that meaningfully higher for the rest of the year like 30 basis points, 40 basis points higher for example. And then M&A is tapering out and that's going to give you a few basis points of pressure on the revenue growth as well. CarlosRodriguez: From my list here, I think Jan probably went through all of them, but we talked about the PEO pull forward on SUI, we talked about FX, we talk about M&A. Those are probably small. I don't know if we can quantify it exactly. But even if we have a bounce back in the third quarter around our new business bookings there's clearly a revenue implication from the prior quarter right from the current quarter that we're talking about now on the third and fourth quarter. So that has a little bit of an impact as well. JasonKupferberg: Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks guys. JanSiegmund: And Jason just to confirm your question earlier. So the $15 million that we gave you is a 1% change in new business bookings translating into an annualized $15 million. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffetNathanson. Your line is now open. LisaEllis: Hey, good morning, guys. First question is on the PEO consolidation, obviously paychecks has made a couple of acquisitions in the PEO space and there remain hundreds of small players in that space. But I know in the past Carlos, you've mentioned some hesitation around the ability to consolidate that space given different risk parameters. Can you just update us on your view on growth in the PEO business and whether that in your view needs to be organic or whether there is an opportunity to do some inorganic consolidation as well? CarlosRodriguez: Thanks for the question. Lisa, it's a good question. I think in the case of the PEO, one of the things that is a little different from the PEO from the rest of our business, and I think this will probably be true for everyone out there, is that when you make an acquisition, you're buying obviously platforms you're buying, people existing clients which are also buying, historical underwriting decisions, and so I would kind of compare it to, even some -- maybe not a great comparison to a bank or an insurance company in the sense that whether or not you're taking risk, you are buying a book of business that you didn't underwrite yourself. And so that doesn't mean that you can't get comfortable which is probably what paychecks was able to do. You go in and you take samples of clients that have been brought into the book of business, as you look at underwriting standards and so it's not -- it's not possible to do acquisitions in the PEO or in banks or an insurance company that happens obviously all the time. But, it's generally not ADP style. Given that we work so hard to make our business perform, as the rest of the ADP businesses. So the thing we do for example with ACE Insurance around reinsurance is to really have the revenue growth in the margins and the profit of the PEO behave like the typical processing business in ADP, that tends to make it hard for us to go out into the marketplace looking for PEO acquisitions, it doesn't mean that we're not open for business. So we, I think we are -- we do have this inherent advantage versus some PEOs in the sense that we have our own internal referral systems because, of the thousands of salespeople that we have out on the street. And so we think that's fuel for our organic growth is something that we should pay more attention to than inorganic growth. But I'd say we were open to that idea and to that concept. But I think the best way to put it is -- the bar is higher than maybe for other types of acquisitions in our company. LisaEllis: Terrific, thank you. And then my follow up is related to cash card. I know that offering in that acquisition that you've made about a year, year and a half ago now. It's targeted at this disbursement market to the contract worker market which elsewhere across the payments world is kind of going like wildfire. So I'm just wondering can you give us just an update on the progress with that acquisition and the monetization of that product -- the traction you're seeing with that product in your base. JanSiegmund: Thank you, Lisa. The Global Cash Card acquisition was a second major acquisition now has annualized in the ADP portfolio. There's another one that we are very happy about. We -- it's a fairly strategic move for us to augment our payment capabilities, as a leading payroll provider in the country and in the globe really, and we had very good success with the Global Cash Card. It documented our capabilities and the integration of our existing card business with Global Cash Card and the strategic initiatives that we had in our business plans are all making very good progress. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. JeffSilber: Thanks so much. You had commented earlier about the tone of business from your clients. I'm assuming you were most referring to the U.S. I know Europe is relatively small component of your portfolio, but can you talk about what's going on there? CarlosRodriguez: Yes. That's small, again it's all -- it's a good point, it's relative to the size of ADP, you could say that it's not a huge percentage. It's a pretty good sized business; we have a very large business in Europe that's performing quite well. And so, even though there you could argue that there's some deceleration kind of second derivative deceleration, the business is clearly better than it was three years ago, four years or five years ago. There is -- unemployment is decreasing, employment is rising, the environment -- the business environment again, and there are headlines and then there are the facts on the ground. I think that the economy may not be as good as it was nine months ago, but it's performing pretty well. And I think that's showing in some of our results. I think we had coincidentally to your question a good quarter in terms of our international bookings particularly, in Europe and particularly in France. So, we see some positive pockets and some optimism in Europe and that certainly helps our overall performance for the company. So we're very happy about that. JeffSilber: I didn't mean to insult your European business sorry about that. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel Financial. Your line is now open. DavidGrossman: Thank you. So Carlos, just based on your comments earlier it sounds like there's a possibility at least, that you may be able to operate with lower headcount without impacting client delivery. So if I'm understanding that correctly, how would you use kind of that excess margin and what does that tell you if anything about the incremental potential operating leverage in the business? CarlosRodriguez: That's a great question because I think there was a comment in our script about competing demands. And so, we believe that we have an opportunity as we've communicated in our 2018 Investor Day for improvements in margin in the -- structurally in the business. On the other hand, we're running the company for the long term. I think I mentioned this in the call last quarter that we're turning 70 years old in June of this year and our intention is to continue to invest and build a business that will endure for another 70 years. And so that means that you have to be cautious about becoming too greedy and being too focused on the short term, and our Board is not going to let that happen and we're not going to let that happen. So I think we're going to be very careful about making sure that whatever improvements we gain from a margin standpoint are not compromising our client satisfaction, not compromising our retention rate and not compromising our investments in product and R&D. DavidGrossman: Okay. Thank you for that. And I guess the other question gets back to the kind of the durability of the model, and I know you've said that you're not seeing any signs of economic weakness. That said, aside from float income which I know there have been some changes in the dynamic since the last recession, but is there any other changes in the business that may suggest it could perform differently, if there were another recession in the next 12 to 24 months, and perhaps you could speak specifically to the PEO which I think it clue to the last recession and just curious whether or not you have any updated thoughts on that, if there was a slowdown and how may impact that business units as well? CarlosRodriguez: It's a great question, because we spend a lot of time thinking about making sure that our business is enduring, and we spend certainly some amount of time about what our reaction would be to any kind of slowdown. So I think that the most important thing heading into a slowdown would be to do the things that we are doing now and we're not doing them because we expect the slowdown, we're doing them because it was the right thing to do. Having high client satisfaction scores, having strong retention, making sure that you're properly invested in your sales engine and most importantly having great products. And so one of things that I'm excited about is our next generation solutions and some of the other investments we've been making in R&D over multiple years are really just in front of us. They're not behind us, so we only have handfuls of clients and we expect in a few years to have many more and we expect that to make us more competitive and we expect that to lower our cost structure as well. And so if it just so happens that we have a recession in two years, and it just so happens that we have our new products really coming to market and getting the traction we expect them to get, then I would expect that we would on a relative basis outperform where we would have performed in the past and where we would see our competitors performing. So that is again one ray of optimism, I think is that we've been making some investments in the business that they weren't intended to address a recession but they would be particularly handy in case of a recession. DavidGrossman: And how about in the context of the PEO? Would you expect some more performance as we did 10 years ago or is it just the business is more mature or has it penetrated? So that would be a lot to expect from that particular business? CarlosRodriguez: Well, I would hope that it will continue to perform the same way because it is a business like similar businesses where an economic slowdown sometimes creates more discussions and more opportunities, it doesn't mean you can't -- you don't have to go execute against those and get those deals and get those contracts which sometimes gets harder in the upmarket as people restrain budgets. But, there is an argument to be made potentially that in the PEO, in a downturn people do look for alternatives and outsourcing opportunities to stabilize and control their own costs and that creates some opportunities for the PEO. It's probably going too far to say that the PEO is countercyclical but it has performed well in the last couple of downturns as we've been through two downturns now since we've owned the PEO and it's performed quite well in both -- in both settings. And just a couple of last thoughts on their previous comments as I thought more about it, heading into a recession, clearly the comment about our ability to run the business with less headcount is accurate. And I think that is incredibly helpful. Having a leaner organization with less complexity and executing really well is an incredibly important part of having an organization that's prepared for any kind of downturn, so that we can weather that. Operator : Thank you. And we have time for one more question. Our final question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. KevinMcVeigh: Great, thank you. Hey, Carlos, you've been working hard on the retention. I wonder if you could just give us a little update on that. You reaffirmed the guidance where kind of most of the progress has been viewed kind of down, mid- upmarket. And then any thoughts on -- just a longer term where that can get to? CarlosRodriguez: Well, I think -- I hate -- I know this is terrible to do, so I'd just take you back to our 2018 Investor Day where I think we provided some ideas around where we think retention will go in the next several years. There are some structural issues around retention particularly in the down market where out of business I think creates natural turnover in the client base. But we still have quite a bit of controllable losses in all of our businesses. So I think from the practical -- answer mathematically is that there's quite a bit of potential still in terms of retention improvement. But the guardrails around that are the realities of history where I think over long periods of time ADP has been able to improve retention structurally over long periods of times which is very impressive and that's due probably to a combination of execution, higher attach rates and more stickiness of products associates performing better. There are probably a number of factors. But these things have happened in; call it, 20 basis point, 25 basis point increments not one or two percentage points in one year. And so I think it's probably a multi-year multi-decade effort to just continue to ratchet up retention because any improvements in retention, obviously, are incredibly important in terms of the business model profitability and the lifetime value that we create at the client -- at the client level. It really makes a huge difference for the economics of the business. So we're going to continue to focus on it. And I guess the simple answer is we still think there's a lot of upside opportunity on retention, but it requires us to have great products which, we are, just now I think focused on rolling out into the market in certain areas. If you take the example of our down market and now our mid-market you would argue that ADP has a lot of potential for improvement in retention. KevinMcVeigh: And can you remind us is there a way to quantify how much of the retention is just business failings as opposed to competed away? CarlosRodriguez: I think we'll get back to you on that one in terms of overall for ADP if memory serves me correctly, in our downmarket business it's between 5% and 10% of the overall losses. Somewhere in that ballpark are, what we call, uncontrollable, so bankruptcies and just companies going out of business because small businesses start and then they -- they kind of go out of business. You've seen the stats around what the average life expectancy is for a company that's less than 50 employees or five years it's -- there's a natural churn in that space. As you get into the mid-market, the upmarket and international the structural retention rates are much higher the potential rates are incredibly high and our multinational business and global view specifically, 98% to 100% retention is really kind of the expected retention rate there, it's quite a resilient business. End of Q& A Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos Rodriguez : So we appreciate your questions today and as you can see we're very pleased with the start of the year and we're happy, I think not just because of the strong financial performance which we clearly had, but mostly -- most importantly we're very happy about having been able to accomplish that while continuing to improve our client satisfaction scores and in some cases having those reach record high levels. As always I want to thank our associates. I think they're the ones that are able to allow us to deliver these kinds of record client satisfaction results which then allow us to deliver the financial results and the great service that we deliver to our clients and appreciate their patients and everyone patients as we continue to enhance and refine our products, our service tools and as we go through our transformation efforts, because I know the change is not easy, but clearly our associates have embraced it and we're executing well against the transformation initiatives. We'll obviously continue to be confident in the strategy that we've laid out here over the last couple of years and also we've been talking about for the last few quarters about the performance of the business this year. And we feel good very good about the momentum for the rest of the fiscal year. So with that I thank you for joining us today. And I thank you for your continued interest in ADP. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Brian and I will be your conference operator. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Third Quarter Fiscal 2019 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Christian Greyenbuhl, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Christian Greyenbuhl : Thank you, Bryan, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining ADP's Third Quarter Fiscal 2019 earnings call and webcast. [Technical Difficult] Earlier this morning we released our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2019. These earnings materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the quarterly investor presentation that accompanies today's call, as well as our quarterly history of revenue and pretax earnings by report of the segment. During our call today we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that excludes the impact of certain items in the third quarter and full year of fiscal 2019, as well as the third quarter and full year of fiscal 2018. A description of these items and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release. Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectation. As always, please do not hesitate to reach out should you have any questions. And with that, let me turn the call over to Carlos. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you, Christian, and thank everyone for joining our call. Before we get started with the earnings discussion I'd first like to welcome Kathleen to the call, into her new role as ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Kathleen comes to us with a strong operating background and we look forward to her contributions in partnership as we execute on our transformation initiatives. I also know that she is looking forward to the opportunity to meet with you over the coming months. Let's now move to a brief review of the quarter. Jan will then take us through the quarter results in more detail, after which Kathleen will take us through an update to our fiscal 2019 outlook. This morning we reported our third quarter fiscal 2019 results with revenue of $3.8 billion up 4% on a reported basis, 5% organic constant currency. This revenue growth was in line with our expectations and continued to be aided in part by the strength of our Employer Services down market offerings and multinational solutions. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13% to $1.77 per share and benefited from continued strength in our margin performance, lower adjusted effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding. We are pleased with the overall results this quarter and we believe our performance continues to highlight the underlying strength of our business model. I\u2019d now like to turn to our sales and marketing initiatives, starting with our solid 10% growth in Employer Services, new business bookings for the quarter and then discuss some of our recent sales and marketing investments. First, we are pleased with our Employer Services, new business bookings performance this quarter which benefited from broad-based growth. With three quarters behind us, we feel good about our overall progress this year. At the same time we continuously work to identify new opportunities and investments and learn to leverage our world class sales force to help drive sustainable growth and build on our position as a leader in the growing global HCM market. With this in mind, at the end of March we completed an agreement with a mid-sized regional payroll services provider to convert their clients to workforce Now or RUN, depending on business needs and complexity. From time to time we leverage our scale to engage in transactions like these where we acquire a client list from a third party for the right to sell and convert those clients onto our platforms. While historically not significant enough to call out, this transaction was larger than usual. The timing of this agreement means that while it did not impact our third quarter new business bookings performance, we do anticipate incremental benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 from this investment together with some added expense pressure. We are confident that our sales force and implementation teams are well equipped to capture this new opportunity, however the timing of the impact from our conversion efforts will depend on the needs of these clients. With that said, as we work to execute on our plans to capture this new opportunity, we are raising our ES New Business Bookings guidance to 8% and 9% growth for fiscal 2019 from our prior guidance of 6% to 8% growth. This deal was not contemplated in our second quarter guidance and we believe that even without this new opportunity we would have achieved at least the low end of our previous guidance range. Moving on to our recent brand initiatives. At ADP we have always taken great pride in delivering solutions that help simplify complexities for our clients and their workers. Part of our transformation effort has been to execute towards that goal and we\u2019ve continued to make great progress on that front. With this progress in mind, earlier this year we felt it was an opportune time to launch a new brand platform to better reflect the changes we've been making. This initiative represents an important step in our journey to enhance the employee experience with innovative HCM Solutions and insights designed with the worker as the central focus. We carried those thoughts through our brand campaign which asks, what are you working for? In partnership with our clients we asked them and others to share stories about the world of work through the eyes of their people, bringing to light a range of motivations and passions. The key insight from these discussions is that work is about more than what you do. It's about achieving something greater for oneself and others. Our goal in this campaign is to elevate the discussion around the evolution of work and promote a dialogue about what motivates people in the workforce and how we at ADP, in addressing these evolving needs, are always designing for people. This new brand platform and tagline is an expression of what ADP stands for and reinforces our relentless determination to rethink a better, more personalized world that works so everyone can achieve their full potential. Continuing on the theme of work, a few weeks ago I had the opportunity to attend our 26 ANNUAL ADP Meeting of the Minds Client Conference. This event affords us the opportunity to engage in a deeper and broader matter with our larger enterprise clients on their challenges, while also sharing with them our perspectives on the latest trends in HCM, including what we're doing to help employers and their workers tackle these issues. As the world of work changes, the challenges that employers face are becoming increasingly broad and complex. What was clear from the conference is that employers seek a strategic HCM partner, not just a software vendor. We are in need of expertise, someone they can trust and someone who will also help them rise to the new challenges in the face of an increasingly complex and fast paced world of work, one where the war for talent remains intense. With a record number of attendees at the conference this year, the feedback was very positive throughout the event. Clients and prospects were able to spend time learning about new products and functionality, not only from our experts but also from nearly 40 of our strategic partners, including a record number from our ADP marketplace. As a leading global technology company providing HCM solutions, we are uniquely positioned to help employers and their workers, whether it's through solutions that can help them with recruitment to retirement or through our unmatched big data capabilities, I was proud of the reception we received for our continued efforts to deliver innovative solutions with excellent service. The focus that we are putting on our products and services are only part of our strategy to deliver stronger solutions to our clients. We also believe in a more integrated product strategy and a more open ecosystem. We see shifts not only in how our clients want to connect with us, but also in how workers connect with each other, notably through collaboration platforms. These platforms are reshaping how people communicate and access information within a company. With products like ADPs Virtual Assistant Bot, employees and HR Leaders now have the convenience of a tool that can help them remove friction in the employee experience by allowing them within the collaboration platforms to view their pay summary and deductions, make time off requests and more, all while also reducing the time spent by HR and payroll practitioners on low value added tax. This allows them to be more strategic and focused on driving business success. Innovations like these that enhance the employer and employee experience are continuing to help drive improvements in our client satisfaction and net promoter scores, an important element in our ability to reaffirm our expectations of 25 to 50 basis points of improvement in ES Revenue Retention for fiscal 2019. Receiving positive recognition for our efforts from both our clients and third parties bolsters our confidence in our investments. Earlier this quarter we were especially please when we were recognized for our vision and strategy by Everest Group who named ADP a leader in the Peak Matrix Multi Country Payroll Outsourcing and Multi Country Payroll Platform Report, and once again named ADP a leader and star performer in its Annual Peak Matrix for Multi Process Human Resources Outsourcing Providers. We are also proud to note that we were the only provider selected as both the leader and star performer among the vendors evaluated, underscoring the strength of our position, as well as the improvements we continue to make. In April we also announced that Nelson Hall once again recognized ADP as the overall leader for next generation payroll services, highlighting ADPs ability to meet future client requirements and deliver immediate benefits to payroll services clients. It's rewarding when influencers and clients alike recognize us for our progress. Now for one final thought before I hand the call over to Jan, at ADP we are proud of our efforts to foster a culture of learning and development in order to better attract, train and retain top talent. This is why I was especially pleased with this quarter to see that we were once again included among LinkedIn\u2019s top companies for 2019. This award highlights the Top 50 companies that were most in demand by job seekers and I'm pleased to say that we moved up 21 places the number 20 on this list. Overall, our investments in the business are showing positive momentum and we are pleased with the progress we are making against our objective of driving sustainable, long term growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan for his commentary on our third quarter results. Jan Siegmund : Thank you, Carlos, and good morning everyone. Our consolidated revenue this quarter was $3.8 billion, up 4% on a reported basis, 5% organic constant currency, and as Carlos said, this was in line with our expectations. With that said, we have been seeing more pressure for the impact of FX which drove approximately 1 percentage points of pressure this quarter. We continue to see strong momentum throughout our down market HCM offerings. In addition, excluding the impact of FX, we are pleased to see continued underlying strength across our international offerings, in particular from our multinational solutions. I would also like to remind you of the PEO, SUI revenue timing impact last quarter, which also impacted our third quarter consolidated revenue growth by approximately 1% and PEO revenue growth by approximately 2%. There was no impact on our full year revenue estimates from this event. Our earnings before income taxes increased 12% and adjusted EBIT increased 10%. Adjusted EBIT margin was up about 140 basis points compared to last year's third quarter and included 20 basis points of pressure from acquisitions. This margin improvement was slightly ahead of our expectations and benefited from a few key drivers. In addition to benefiting from our early, voluntary early retirement program, we also continue to see incremental efficiencies within our IT infrastructure helping to drive improvements in our overall cost base. Also we continue to execute on a number of tactical and incremental transformation initiatives, which while none are individually significant enough to call out collectively are helping to drive net productivity improvements across the business. The benefits from these initiatives together with the impact from our underlying operating approach were partially offset by incremental investments in the third quarter related to the launch of our new brand platform and growth and selling expenses. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 23.5% and benefited from the impact of corporate tax reform, certain tax credit adjustments and the release of reserves for certain tax positions \u2013 for uncertain tax positions, and a small amount of unplanned stock compensation tax benefit. This rate compares to our 24% adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter of last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13% to $1.77 and in addition to benefiting from our margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate was also aided by fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. Now for our segment results. For Employment Services, revenues grew 3% for the quarter, 4% organic constant currency and we are in line with expectations. As a reminder, we had anticipated a deceleration from the first half as we have now lapped the acquisitions of global Cash Card and Work Market, and our revenue continues to be impacted by pressure from FX. Interest income on client funds grew 24% and benefited from a 30 basis points improvement in the average yield earned on our client fund investments and growth and average client funds balances of 4% compared to a year ago. This growth in balances was driven by a combination of client growth, wage inflation and growth in our pays per control, offset by lower SUI kind of collections. Also as we mentioned last quarter, we continue to expect lower SUI rates and the impact of FX to put added pressure on to our balance growth for the reminder of the year. Our same store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 3.1% for the quarter. Moving on to Employer Services margin, we saw an increase of about 230 basis points in the quarter, which includes approximately 30 basis points of pressure from the impact of acquisitions. This continued strength as a result of the same factors I mentioned earlier regarding our consolidated results which are continuing to help to improve our underlying efficiencies. Our PEO services grew 6% in the quarter and as I mentioned earlier, this revenue growth experienced approximately 2 percentage points of pressure in the third quarter due to the PEO SUI revenue timing impact we experienced last quarter. This pressure was also the primary driver for lower PEO revenues excluding zero-margin benefit pass-throughs which grew 2% for the quarter. This timing issue does not impact the full year revenue guidance that Kathleen will shortly discuss. Average worksite employees increased 8% to 554,000 for the quarter. Overall we continue to see some positive signs of normalization in the retention compared to the pressure we had seen last year among our larger PEO clients, and we\u2019re also starting to see some positive signs from the changes to our sales incentives that we made last year. We therefore maintained cautiously optimistic as we head into our fourth quarter regarding the continued gradual reacceleration of the growth in the average worksite employee, in particular given the volatility we may experience during our fiscal year Fourth Quarter Annual Health Care Renewals. The PEO segments margins decreased 10 basis points for the quarter due to grow over pressure from incremental selling expenses and adjustments to our loss reserve estimates related to ADP Indemnity, offset by operating leverage within the business and benefits from our voluntary early retirement program. This margin performance was ahead of our own expectations as we continue to see sequential reductions in our ADP indemnity loss reserve estimates, as well as lower than expected growth in the zero-margin pass-through revenues. We continue to benefit from the underlying strength of our business model. We remain committed to reinvesting into the business and to leveraging the strength of our organization to drive change. Our results this quarter reflect our success in driving these initiatives and we are pleased with our progress this year. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Kathleen for our fiscal year 2019 outlook. Kathleen Winters : Thank you, Jan, and thank you Carlos for the warm welcome to ADP, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'm looking forward to meeting many of you over the coming weeks and months. I'll start now with the outlook for Employer Services. We now expect revenue growth for fiscal 2019 to be at the lower end of our previous guidance range of 5% to 6% growth. We narrowed our guidance this quarter since we expect slightly elevated pressure from the impact of FX and as I will discuss shortly, we have also narrowed down our guidance for interest income from client funds as a result of changes to the forward yield curve this quarter. We continue to anticipate growth of 2.5% in our pays per control metric. We are raising our fiscal 2019 ES New Business Bookings Guidance to 8% to 9%. Regarding the agreement that we completed in March, I'd like to highlight that this was not an acquisition of a business. We will however be recognizing an intangible asset for the acquired client list. We are not disclosing the purchase price for this asset, but you will see some activity related to this investment in additions to intangibles on our cash flow statement. And starting in the fourth quarter we will begin to amortize this intangible asset in accordance with our policies for similar transactions. While we anticipate incremental expense from our brand efforts and the increase in our sales guidance, as well as incremental amortization related to intangible assets, we are raising our ES margin outlook and now anticipate full year ES margins to expand about 225 basis points from our prior forecast of 175 to 200 basis points. Our outlook also continues to contemplate 50 basis points of acquisition drag for the year. Moving on to the PEO, we continue to expect 9% to 10% PEO revenue growth in fiscal 2019 and 8% to 9% growth in average worksite employees. We also continue to anticipate 8% to 9% growth in PEO revenues excluding zero-margin benefits pass-throughs. With the better than expected performance in our PEO margin this quarter, we now expect margins to be up 25 to 50 basis points as compared to our prior forecast of at least flat. With the continued reduction in our loss reserves related to ADP Indemnity we've adjusted our estimate to 25 basis points of grow over pressure on a full year basis from our prior estimate of 50 basis points. I\u2019ll now go to the consolidated outlook. With the adjustments to our ES revenue outlook we now anticipate total revenue growth at the lower end of our 6% to 7% range for fiscal 2019. We continue to expect the growth in average client funds balances to be about 4%. We are adjusting slightly our expected growth in client funds interest revenue to about $90 million from our prior estimate of $90 million to $100 million, and for the total impact from the client funds extended investment strategy to grow about $70 million from a prior estimate of $70 million to $80 million. The details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides on our investor relations website. We now anticipate our adjusted EBIT margin to expand at least 150 basis points compared to our prior forecast of 125 to 150 basis points. This outlook continues to include approximately 30 basis points of pressure from acquisitions. With the benefit for this quarter to our effective tax rate, we are lowering our adjusted effective tax rate expectation to 23.8% for fiscal 2019 compared to our prior estimate of 24.4%. And with these adjustments to our outlook, we now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to grow 19% to 20% from our prior forecast of 17% to 19%. We continue to be pleased with our overall execution. And with that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from the line of Mark Marcon of Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. Mark Marcon : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Well Carlos, Jan and Kathleen nice to meet you. Wondering if you can talk a little bit about the new type of deal in terms of taking over for you know existing payroll providers. Just how does that compare to when you win a new client just from an economic perspective and how big is that opportunity as we look out over the next few years. Carlos Rodriguez : Well in terms of helping you size it, I think that based on the comments you made about our new business bookings. I think you can back into it. It\u2019s about a 2 to 3 percentage point impact for the year on new business bookings gross. So that gives you a sense of from a bookings standpoint what the size of the opportunity is. And just in terms of elaborating a little bit more on it, we actually do these types of deals on a much smaller basis on a fairly regular basis and have been doing them for 20 to 30 years where small providers that are either retiring or selling out, want to sell their book of business, we are not really interested in buying additional platforms or frankly taking infrastructure or offices and so forth. So we structure it really as an agreement where we buy the right to convert the clients and we get some help, and some assistance from the seller. But in essence it looks a lot like a typical new business and the economics would look a lot like a typical new business with the exception of course that we have to pay some acquisition costs if you will to the seller. But the way we organize the effort is very similar to a typical sales effort in a sense that we send out either through our inside sales force or our field sales force, people to get the client to sign a contract with ADP, because we are not buying contracts and we're not buying the business. So they become an ADP client on our pricing terms and we in essence implement them with our resources onto our platform. So it looks a lot like a business as usual. The reason we had to call it out is obviously the size. These typically are frankly really small, a couple of thousand, even in the hundreds of clients CPA Firm or an owner of a small payroll company may be retiring. This is a much larger transaction that has a material, somewhat material impact on our results and our guidance and we thought it was important to point out. We are being a little bit coy about you know the details because obviously for competitive reasons we are literally right in the middle of converting all these clients. So our sales force has already been out for several weeks \u201cselling and converting\u201d these clients and we've begun the implementation process. But most of our competitors are aware of this transaction that was going on. So they are going after those clients as well. So we just rather not talk about it more than we have to, just to make sure we give you the proper context and the proper guidance. Mark Marcon : I just meant from a strategic perspective, longer term do you see more of these types of opportunities coming up as you and some of the other large national players have invested more behind technology and smaller regional players just can't keep up. Carlos Rodriguez : Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t call this a small regional player. So this is probably as you get more information about it, I think it will become obvious. This is kind of the last of its kind as far as I'm aware and just for historical purposes, I was personally involved. In 2007 was the first time that I met with this organization about trying to create an opportunity for us to acquire this business or in this case the right to convert these clients and there were people before me who had already been having those discussions. So this has been going on for quite a long time. So I would say this is in the category of relatively unique and in terms of size and also type of payroll provider that it is. Mark Marcon : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Jason Kupferberg : Hey thanks, good morning guys. I just wanted to ask a follow-up on that point with this new agreement. Is there anything baked into the revenue guidance for the year and can you give us a rough sense of how many clients this involves and then just was there any promotional pricing or any extra promotional pricing in Q3 to help fuel the bookings rebound that we saw, the 10%? Carlos Rodriguez : There was nothing incremental in Q3 in terms of just answering that question first, which I think is somewhat unrelated to the other questions. So the answer to that is, not that I'm aware of. There was no \u2013 nothing artificial done or nothing \u2013 remember part of \u2013 I tried to explain in the second quarter and hopefully this is some indication that we were giving you guys the right story is that calendar wise we had some, a couple of days of selling that moved into the third quarter from the second quarter. So if you remember we had a relatively weak second quarter new business booking. So I think some of it is calendar. Frankly it\u2019s even better than we expected based on just the calendar explanations. So I think it was just an overall good rebound and good performance. In terms of the size of the transaction impact on revenues, just because of the mechanics that our business operates on, as I mentioned that our sales forces is literally right now getting sales orders, converting the clients and we have implementation, people starting the implementation process. We have implemented some clients, but it was \u2013 it's an insignificant impact on revenues for the fourth quarter, but a significant impact in booking in new business bookings, which is why we've adjusted the guidance the way we have. The other factor that I would mention is, as you do your work on margins and so forth and you might notice some pressure in the fourth quarter, there's also again typical of the way our business works. We have a significant pressure from an expense standpoint in the fourth quarter as a result of incremental selling expense and in this case we also have the amortization of the intangible without the offsetting \u201crevenues\u201d because they haven't started yet. Some of them have stated, most of the impact on revenues is in the first quarter and beyond of next fiscal year. So it's a meaningful headwind from a cost standpoint and the other thing to keep in mind is if you recall, last year's fourth quarter we had very, very strong margin improvement. So the comparison is difficult, plus we have this fairly significant expense pressure from this transaction which obviously hurts us in the fourth quarter and it\u2019s slightly dilutive. I think we figured it\u2019s a couple of pennies I think we talked about? Kathleen Winters : Yeah, a couple of pennies in the fourth quarter. Carlos Rodriguez : But it will help us I think on a go forward basis, because obviously by the first quarter almost all of that selling expense will have \u2013 and implementation expenses will be behind us. The amortization expense will still be with us, but most of the acquisition and implementation expenses will already be behind us, and then we\u2019ll have the revenue and incremental margin from that business. So again, had we just made sure that we don\u2019t over complicate this, if we had a \u2013 which we\u2019ve had in the past. If we had a blow-out fourth quarter sales results, it would be about the same discussion. We would have had a lot of incremental selling expense and implementation expense, and it would be good news for future growth and for revenues that it will be pressure in the short term on the earnings. Jason Kupferberg : Right, right. So that kind of leads to my follow-up question just on margin, because obviously the execution continues to be very strong there. So you are absorbing some of these incremental costs, yet you did raise the guidance again for margins for this year. So I wanted to talk a little bit about just your plans to backfill some of the roles that are being vacated or have been vacated by the early retirement program. How are you thinking about that now versus what you initially envisioned in terms of back filled percentage? Carlos Rodriguez : It's a great question. I think the way that I look at it, just from a 40,000 foot level is really head count growth year-over-year, because there's so many other pieces of noise like this incremental expense pressure we have in the fourth quarter that\u2019s the best way to really kind of \u2013 given that most of our expense is really people related is really FTE growth year-over-year and I think on that basis as we expected and as we predicted and as we encouraged our organization to do, we closed some of the gap that we had in the first quarter by the third quarter. So we're still ahead and we wouldn't be increasing our guidance if we hadn't been still ahead. So we\u2019re still a little bit ahead of where we thought we would be in terms of not back filling as much as we expected, but we closed some of that gap. Now that was the appropriate thing to do, because we want to make sure that our client retention, our client satisfaction, our NPS score stay. I think it\u2019s at the record levels that they are in some of our business units, so that was an important objective for us, which was to extract incremental margin and efficiency out of the organization and out of the business, but at the same time making sure that we stayed focused on client satisfaction and client service. I think we're doing that, I think we've landed the plane in a fairly good place. I think the organization responded well. I think to the absorption of the early retirement reductions, as well as the reworking of some of the things that we do and some of the processes that we have in order to make sure that we can continue to deliver the high levels of service that we have with fewer people. Jan Siegmund : And maybe I'll add within the nuts and bolts, as a reminder we anticipated the impact of the older early retirement program to happen in your life. The impact of approximately $150 million and we are anticipating that to be true going forward. So the overall opportunity has not increased, but we captured in this fiscal year a higher percentage of that total number which we now expect slightly to be below that and like 140 \u2013 I would say roughly $140 million to $150 million. So we think Jason that the overall assumptions regarding the back hiring and the backfills remains intact. Carlos Rodriguez : And I think in terms of new contact this was a fairly large undertaking that we hadn't been through before. So I think in the context of you know the guess work that went into the backfills and the pacing of those backfills and so what, I think the organization did a great job. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. Jan, best of luck to you and Kathleen, I look forward to meeting soon. Jan Siegmund : Thank you. Kathleen Winters : Likewise. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Jim Schneider : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations to both, Jan and Kathleen. Maybe just to start out, maybe Carlos, can you provide a little bit of color on your view on where the PEO market demand stands right now. Anything that you are seeing that makes you kind of more or less encouraged about the demand outlook and your ability to kind of sustain the same pace of growth over the next few quarters as you have seen, and maybe kind of give us any color around the comment that I believe Jan made on the kind of cautious optimism around the healthcare renewal season. Carlos Rodriguez : No, I think from a long term strategic standpoint, don't really see any changes from what we've seen for the last, honestly a couple of decades, which is kind of the underlying environment of increasing complexity for small employers and even in this case mid-sized employers I think continues to be a reality. I think the war for talent I think just adds to that dimension of you know small and mid-sized companies now on top of having to deal with regulation and complexity and so forth and it happens in every administration. We\u2019ve seen now this administration obviously has a different view of regulations, but there's still a lot of activity. Like there\u2019s a recent announcement around changes in the overtime regulation that had been previously announced under the Obama administration. So that the world continues to become difficult and complex for small and mid-sized employers and then on top of that very low unemployment rates create a real competitive issue for people to find talent. So all of those things I think are, I think fuel for kind of the long term strategic growth of the PEO models. So there's really nothing that I see that\u2019s changed that potential net trajectory. There\u2019s still relatively low penetration whether it\u2019s at the ADP client base level or even out in the marketplace. The number of clients on PEO's relative to the available market is still relatively small. You know there's obviously noise along the way as Jan mentioned. You know we have a healthcare renewal in the fourth quarter, but we have that every year. We have year-end which tends to create a lot of activity as well and by that I mean January 1, which that's now the times this year, but that occurs every year. You have other kind of events that happen along the way, like ACA was an event that I think had an impact, first positive and then slightly negative afterwards in its week. So there are things that you know will create ups and downs, but overall we're still very bullish on that business in terms of the long term outlook. Jan Siegmund : And on the short term Jim, you were following up on the specifics of the healthcare renewal I think. We don't see anything specifically positive or negative on this healthcare renewal, so it's kind of \u2013 it always changes by carrier as we receive the proposals, but it feels like largely in line with the historic trends that we have seen. Jim Schneider : That\u2019s helpful, thank you. And then as we think about the kind of go forward impact of the book of business you are taking on, can you maybe help us a little bit as we model forward or model in terms of for example over the next quarter or by the end of June if he signs the rough number of clients you expect to get out of and be able to convert. What percentage of those clients you think you'll be able to sign up of the total by the end of June? Jan Siegmund : I think the easiest way Jim to think about it is we increased our guidance and you've got basically the incremental number from Carlos today. If you translate those new business bookings, they will be caused by largely smaller clients. We anticipate an almost full run rate of revenues for next year. So you just translate the incremental new business bookings into yes, they are all yes clients and then they will become revenues. Jim Schneider : Helpful, thank you. Jan Siegmund : Like 1% of new business bookings growth Christian reminds me, there\u2019s approximately $15 million of revenue. So that gives you a good \u2013 I think that gives you a fair sizing of the opportunity. Jim Schneider : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays. Your line is now open. Ramsey El-Assal: Yeah, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you about the pricing environment. I think you mentioned last quarter it firmed up a bit and I just was wondering if you could update us on any pricing trends that you are seeing more recently, maybe into the year and selling season? Carlos Rodriguez : In my advantage \u2013 yeah, you're right. By pricing I mean we said that our promotions were down year-over-year and I think that was a sign of maybe things firming up. I would say that the information this quarter is not consistent with that, so I think if you look at the full year now after three quarters, they are probably like around the same place we were in the previous year, so again that's why sometimes it\u2019s better to not say much, because it will look like maybe there was some kind of trend there, but I would say there's really no, there's no trend. I think that we don't see any major, unless Jan has or Christian has any other observations, but I think \u2013 because we get so much information and so much data to prepared for these calls the sometimes we get too much into the weeds. And so there was some signs of use of less promotions in the first two quarters of the year and you know I think now when you look at it over the course of nine months \u2013 by the way our heavy selling season is the third quarter in one of our business where we sign up a lot of the clients as of the beginning of the year. So I\u2019d say there is really probably nothing meaningful to report, is that a fair\u2026? Jan Siegmund : I think that's fair. Ramsey El-Assal: Okay, great. [Cross Talk] Carlos Rodriguez : For whatever that was. Ramsey El-Assal: Great, terrific. On just a broader macro question, are you seeing any changes, any you know updates on the broader macro environment, and maybe sort of a slice there kind of U.S. versus non-U.S. business, maybe particularly Europe. Is there any interesting call outs there to report or is it just sort of you still see a pretty smooth macro environment sort of unfolding. Jan Siegmund : Yes, I felt \u2013 I think it was a couple of quarters ago where I got a question, I gave a very short answer about nothing or anything going wrong in the economy and then I looked like I was going to have egg on my face in December and January, but maybe we\u2019re now somewhat vindicated in terms of \u2013 our data has been consistently showing I think the economy continuing to move along at a very good pace. And so I think today we \u2013 the national and former report came out. You see our pace booking pool number and you see government GDP reports a few days ago and I think all of those are consistent with I think an economy that's performing quite well and so I would say we would stick to the same; won\u2019t be quite as cavalier anymore about making economic predictions, but we don't see any real change in the current trends. Obviously Jan and I've been saying this for a couple of years and I think we\u2019ve so far been proven wrong that you know with unemployment as low as it is, the growth in the amount of employment at some point should slow, but it appears that there's enough people on the sidelines just based on this labor participation rate number that people are still being drawn into the workforce. You know the one thing that we will point out is we\u2019ve seen like the government and others some wage pressure which actually is good for us and we kind of like wage pressure. Not necessarily because of the pressure it puts on our cost internally, but you know our flow business benefits a little bit from higher wage inflation, obviously because it increases our balances. It\u2019s not a meaningful number given how much inflation we've had, but the trend has been up for multiple quarters now. But I think it's all \u2013 it seems like the economy is performing very well and we look at all the other indicators that everyone else looks at, like NFIB optimism leading indicators, all the other Michigan leading indicators, all those other things, I think all look very strong. Jan Siegmund : And if I add two seconds on our European business, the last three months in Europe actually were also stronger relative to our pace for control metrics. I wouldn't over read it, but it was a very solid European quarter also. Ramsey El-Assal: Great, thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffetNathanson. Your line is now open. Lisa Ellis : Hi, good morning guys and welcome to Kathleen. I wanted to ask just a broader question about the competitive dynamics and ADPs performance in the mid and up market. You called out continued strength in RUN and International as drivers of growth. Those have been bright spots for ADP for a long time. Can you just give us an update? I think we're now well over a year past the completion of the workforce now, migrations. Are you back to positive client growth in the mid-market and then also what\u2019s just the update on like the new payroll engine and sort of the long term strategy to improve your competitive position in the upper end. Thanks. Carlos Rodriguez : So when we made the comment about the strength coming from small business and international, it was actually multinational is what we said in our prepared remarks. We\u2019re referring to revenue if you'll recall, which is accurate and actually makes sense, but on our bookings I think we also said that we had broad based new business bookings performance that led to the 10% growth and so by broad based it would include the mid-market and the up market. So we've gotten some help from the decision to you know deploy and sell more aggressively workforce now in the lower end of the national accounts market where the clients that are in kind of the less complex range if you well in smaller size, so call it 1,000 to 5,000 employees and less complex. So that's given a little bit of a boost to our up market sales. I think in the mid-market, when we look at our mid-market business kind of across categories, because we have our traditional payroll business, but we also have a fairly fast growing mid-market business within our PEO, because our PEO sells also mid-market clients. Some of those incentives that we talked about a couple of quarters ago have started to kind of have the desired impact and we've had a little bit of a rebound in the growth of our mid-market PEO business. We also have a mid-market outsourcing business that doesn't have co-employment [ph]. We\u2019ve had it for many years, but that's also a fast growing business as well as within the HRO segment when we talk about the strategic pillars, so it's kind of a sister business if you will to the PEO. So when you add all those together, I think we feel pretty good about our performance in the mid-market. I think our bookings were very good in the third quarter in the up market and I think when you add in global view and some of our other solutions in the up market like standalone tax, like we feel okay about it. As you know we've been very transparent. This is a place where we have work to do and we still think we have some work to do in the very \u2013 in the up market domestic business and our new platform that we affectionately referred to as Lifion I think is intended to help boost that. I think the combination of Lifion, Workforce Now and Vantage I think really are positioning us for a much stronger position in the future than what we've had over the last couple years. Jan Siegmund : If I add to this, we have seen continued improvement in our client satisfaction and retention in particular in the mid-market we\u2019re seeing the benefit of being on one platform, clients staying longer and now for many quarters in a row mid-market retention has really improved overall and so the mid-market, it is to me the midmarket compound of all these factors together is a much stronger position that was just a few quarters ago. Lisa Ellis : Traffic and then maybe my follow-up, you would call out, you are now lapping Cash Card and WorkMarket. Can you help a little bit with where those are starting to plug into your business and how big contributors they are today? Thank you. Carlos Rodriguez : I think that again unfortunately for Work Force, depending on how look at it for ADP, like Global Cash Card had a certainly a measurable impact, just because of the size and I think we\u2019ve disclosed the size of that acquisition and I think the revenue impact. But generally speaking some of these acquisitions tend to have long term strategic value. I think Celergo which you didn't mention, but is another one that I would bring up, we\u2019d expect that to really have a big impact on our multinational business in the future, but it's just you know because of the size of ADP as $14 billion, these acquisitions just are more strategic rather than kind of short term financial impact plays. On the Global Cash Card side, you know that's a place where we're very I think bullish in terms of the future of using the Pay Card I think as an avenue for growth, because we have a very large installed base that we think will fit \u2013 that solutions will fit well for and I think a \u2013 there\u2019s demand out on the market place for it. I think WorkMarket as we\u2019ve said, there\u2019s a huge market if not the size, close to the size of kind of our traditional ADP W-2 business for independent contractors. But you know it\u2019s a very, very small impact in the current fiscal year and probably for the next couple of fiscal years. And so how we are \u2013 what we are doing with these products as an example in the case of WorkMarket, we are building WorkMarket into Lifion. And so you will have a platform available to clients in the up market that will allow them to manage their entire workforce, their W-2 employees, as well as their independent contractors to have full visibility of their entire work force. So that\u2019s an important, I think move that we\u2019ve made to use the intellectual property and leverage that intellectual property. And then in terms of how we are building, the Cash Card into the future is I think we\u2019ve kind of signaled that we think we have an opportunity to create a larger relationship with the worker and so this concept of B2B2C I think is something that Global Cash Card and Wisely specifically gives us I think an entree into it. So again that\u2019s something that its three, five, ten years down the road, but we're very excited about it. Lisa Ellis : Traffic, excellent!. Thanks Carlos, thanks Jan. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Tien- tsin Huang : Thanks. Just one question on margins, because you are running ahead with the raised guidance. I\u2019m curious if this changes your thinking on margins or investments in relation to your longer term targets on margin expansion? Jan Siegmund : So, I think we traditionally provide guidance in August. So I think that would be the tradition that we will stick to. I think we are a middle of our operating plan season here and that will obviously give us a little bit more visibility into \u201920, into fiscal year \u201820 which will then appear in August. You know we gave three year guidance and I think our intention wasn't to update it quarterly. And I think when we get to I think the guidance for fiscal year \u201920 we\u2019ll see I think what that implies in terms of the guidance. Tien- tsin Huang : Got it, so we\u2019ll stay tuned for that. Jan, all the best to you and Kathleen, look forward to working with you. Jan Siegmund : Thank you. Kathleen Winters : Thank you, likewise. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Your line is now open. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Thanks, good morning folks. Kathleen welcome. Jan, it was a pleasure working with you. All the best! I guess my the first question is, in both ES and PEO you seem to have, you seem to be trending more to the lower end of revenue expectations, you did well on margins. I want to ask how you are now thinking of sort of this revenue growth versus margin growth trade-offs. All these margin initiatives have been successful, but is it leading you too much in one direction versus the other and specifically what do you need to do to get up to your 7% to 9% mid-term growth rate? Jan Siegmund : So I mentioned two things. First on Employer Services, I think we tried to be clear that we have a little bit of additional FX pressure which is obviously something that we don't control over or we don't factor it in at the beginning of the year. So I think that\u2019s \u2013 at least for now that\u2019s some of it, because you would see from our third quarter bookings that we feel pretty good about the long term future trajectory from a revenue growth standpoint. On the PEO I think we cautioned I think over many years and even when we did our Investor Day, that a very large part of our guidance around PEO revenues and overall ADP revenues is that the growth of pass-throughs, which has no impact on dollars of profit. It has an impact on margin, because the slower those pass-throughs grow they actually help us with our margin percent objectives, but the faster they grow the more they hurt that margin. And so we\u2019ve cautioned and encourage people to not get too caught up. If the source of weakness is pass-through revenues, that's really not a value creating revenue stream for us. It\u2019s part of the way we \u2013 the business model and its part of the way we bill our clients, but I would say that the tone you should be hearing from us on the PEO is actually quite positive. It has been positive since the first quarter and was positive even entering into the first quarter and the only thing that changed from you know six months before that was the pace of past-through growth which slowed in a meaningful enough way that it put pressure on the top line revenue growth for the PEO. But I would encourage you to stay focused on kind of the revenues, excluding pass-throughs and worksite employees and the other metrics which we feel are actually strong if not ahead of where we expect them to be. Jan Siegmund : And maybe I'll add a more tactical comment because this quarter really had an unusual revenue growth outcome. Just reminding everybody that much of that in the PEO of course we explained with the timing of SUI revenue collection and a couple of other one-time moving items also and we had also a timing effect of revenue relative to processing days in the second quarter that moved into the second quarter on the site. So once you adjust for all of that, actually the organic revenue growth rate for the company is fairly close to where we want it to be and if you look on a year-over-year comparison I think we remain optimistic about an acceleration of our organic revenue growth, in particular in the ES segment that should really drive overall, long term success of the company. And as you know, we have built in scale in our business model. A growing company and shows competitiveness so that\u2019s a strong commitment to drive the revenue growth as we had indicated going forward. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Got it. I did want to go back to the transaction that you announced with what I think is a large bank distribution channel. Without that I believe you said you\u2019d be at the lower end of the bookings range. Is there something going on there with regards to competition, prior year comps pricing, something we should be aware of that is temporary affecting that bookings performance and typically when you buy these sorts of portfolio, I\u2019d imagine they don\u2019t quite have this richer set of portfolio of services you have. So is that an opportunity? Carlos Rodriguez : The last part of your question is there\u2019s defiantly an opportunity there, because you're right, our portfolios a little bit broader. So we are very bushing and very optimistic on the transaction. Just to clarify, we didn't say that we would be at the low end. I did say we would be at lease at the lower end and so we feel based on the third quarter bookings performance, based on momentum we feel pretty good about our situation around the business booking. So maybe we weren't strong enough in conveying that. But I think our sales force is executing quite well. I just want to clarify also, it may not have come through that. I've been working on this deal for, personally for than\u2026 Ashwin Shirvaikar : Since 2007, yeah. Carlos Rodriguez : I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s working on it before. So we didn\u2019t just run out and try to make an acquisition to make the quarter or to get our booking number up for the fourth quarter. I wish it were that easy because we tried many, many times to make this happen over the course of a decade and this happens to be when they occurred and we would have taken it any time any day, because it's good for our shareholders and its good for our business and we\u2019re very, very pleased that we have it. But we have no concerns about anything happening in the macro environment, on the pricing front or otherwise to make us feel less positive about our sales force, our distribution and our new business bookings. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Got it, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of James Berkley with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. James Berkley : Thanks and congratulations Jan and Kathleen. Just a quick follow up on the booking side. Obviously great seeing the guidance being raised. Just how big was the days of selling impact since there was no discounting? I\u2019m just trying to understand the acceleration. I know like holiday sales in January a lot of people struggled across a lot of different industries there, but just trying to get a feel for you know the current trend and how sustainable that is excluding you know the impact of the transaction you are expecting in the next quarter? Thanks. Carlos Rodriguez : If I remember correctly, it would be the same impact that we talked about that impacted the second quarter. We just \u2013 we ended up getting, I think it was two days of less selling in the second quarter which then we got in the third quarter and we saw it. If you remember the conference call that we had, we already had those two days, so we knew we could see that our sales in the first couple weeks of this quarter had kind of rebounded and I think it was a few percentage points if I\u2019m not mistaken. I think was two to three percentage points of impact on the second quarter, which means we probably got a little bit of benefit to that extent in the third quarter. Jan Siegmund : And this timing event overall didn't really impact our full year outlook for new business bookings. So it was really neutral and everything we thought we lost was made up as precise as it can be, and these things was made up in January. Carlos Rodriguez : I think it's fair to say if you take all the noise out of calendar and so forth that we feel like we're right where we thought we would be in terms of book, in terms of where our plans were and where our objections were. Christian Greyenbuhl : And James, I would just remind you like we talked a little bit about FX, right and we also talked about interest income being a little bit weak. So if you are talking about you know in the context of the strength of revenue growth just keep those two items in mind. James Berkley : Okay, great, thanks a lot. I appreciate the color. Operator : Thank you. And we have time for one last question. So our last question will come from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Kevin McVeigh : Great thanks. Is there any way \u2013 and congratulations again on both Jan and Kathleen. If you think about the impact of the retention across \u2013 so the 25 to 50 basis point to that. How much of that come kind of from down market versus mid versus up, just sort of thinking about the year overall? Carlos Rodriguez : Well obviously we don\u2019t provide retention by business unit, but maybe we can give you some \u2013 I think we already gave you some colors, and some sense of that. I think Jan talked about some really good improvement in our mid-market and our mid-market business. We do have obviously a number of other businesses besides kind of the general categories of small, medium and large. Like for example in the down market we have our retirement services business, we have an insurance businesses that really acts as an agency in addition to the traditional payroll business. We talked about the outsourcing businesses that we have, that are in employer services, but are not part of the PEO. So these kind of more comprehensive solutions if you will that those are, those business have gotten to be a meaningful size as well. We have a screening and selection business, we have an RPO business. So we have a lot of moving parts, and I think for us to get improvements in retention, we have to have broad-based improvements and client satisfaction and NPS scores and execution. It\u2019s just there is no way around it. So you have to assume that \u2013 by the way for the last, as long as ADP has been around, we have some people that are performing better, any particular quarter or any particular year, and others that are performing less well. But when you see this kind of trend, you have to assume that the overall company is performing better and executing well, which is what is happening. Kevin McVeigh : That\u2019s super helpful. And then just on the acquisition, are the clients mostly kind of down-mid enterprise or across the board and historically has there been kind of more of a service or they already on the cloud or you would shift them to the cloud as you kind of bring in the mid. Carlos Rodriguez : Its small and mid, which is traditionally the way these \u2013 these acquisitions are typically in that space and technically not acquisitions just to be clear. If you remember, the right to convert the client on our platforms from their previous provider. So these are typically, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever been able to do \u2013 who knows, but we\u2019ve never been able to do this with kind of enterprise size clients. I guess it's technically possible just to buy the right to convert. This typically happens with small and mid-size client. The majority, of the clients would be small clients and some mid-sized clients. Kevin McVeigh : Super, Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question and answer portion for today. I\u2019m pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you. So as you can tell, I think from our comments we are really pleased with the rebound in our bookings. We are happy with this transaction that we consummated in late March. I think we have good momentum. I think our financial performance has been strong. But I also want to kind of call out to the comment and the question about retention. We really wouldn't be able to perform on a long term basis as well as we're performing if we weren\u2019t really delivering strong client satisfaction and better products. So I want to also complement our associates and our organization on staying focused on NPS scores, on client satisfaction and on building stronger products, because the performance of the financial side doesn't come without those factors. And all while we are doing that, we are trying to transform our business and I think become more efficient. So there is a lot of effort and a lot of work and I appreciate all of that everyone is doing. Last thing I just want to mention is obviously we\u2019re very excited about having Kathleen here with us and everyone will get to know her, but it's bittersweet moment here with Jan leaving. As always, even the way he handled this transition was a total class act. So you know we've been partners here for a long time, prior to us being either CEO or CFO, we've been through a lot together, we've done a lot and I just want to thank Jan one more time for everything you've done not just for our shareholders and for all of you who are here on the call. But he\u2019s also done a lot for our clients, our associates, and he did quite a bit for his community as well. So Jan, I thank you again, and I declare you not only Ironman Athlete, but Ironman CFO. Jan Siegmund : Thank you. Carlos Rodriguez : Thanks for everything Jan. Good luck to you. And thank you today for your attention. I appreciate it. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude our program and we may all disconnect. Everybody have a wonderful day!",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Carmen, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2019 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now turn the conference over to Mr. Christian Greyenbuhl, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Christian Greyenbuhl : Thank you, Carmen, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining ADP's fourth quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call and webcast. With me today are Carlos Rodriguez, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Kathleen Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2019. These earnings materials are available on the SEC's website and on our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call as well as our quarterly history of revenue and pretax earnings by reportable segment.During our call today, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description and the timing of these items along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measure can be found in our earnings release. Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, as such, involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. As always, please do not hesitate to reach out should you have any questions.And with that, let me turn the call over to Carlos. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you, Christian, and thank you everyone for joining our call. This morning, we reported our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2019 results with revenue of $3.5 billion for the quarter up 6% reported and organic constant currency. We ended the year with total revenue of $14.2 billion up 6% reported and 7% organic constant currency in line with our expectations.We are pleased with our ability to balance the strong top-line revenue growth with a substantial 160 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion for the year. This margin expansion was ahead of our expectations as we executed well on our transformation initiatives, including our voluntary early retirement program, while also benefiting from increased operating efficiencies. When combined with share buybacks and a lower adjusted effective tax rate, we delivered very strong 20% adjusted EPS growth this year. Our core drivers of growth are also strong with Employer Services new business bookings growing 11% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the year. We are especially pleased with this performance given the difficult compare in fiscal 2018 when bookings grew 19% in the fourth quarter and 9% for the full year.To put our Employer Services new business bookings performance into perspective, this year we sold approximately $1.6 billion of new annualized recurring revenues, which is a testament to the strength and scale of our sales force. When you add in the results of our PEO bookings, which grew double-digits in 2019. Our overall worldwide new business bookings continue to perform in line with our June 2018 Investor Day expectations, benefiting from our investments in targeted incremental selling opportunities as well as investments in our sales force, product and improvements in our productivity.We are very pleased with our strong recent track record of Employer Services bookings in fiscal years 2018 and 2019. With this in mind, we have continued to invest in our distribution and currently expect Employer Services bookings to grow 6% to 8% in fiscal 2020. As a reminder, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 benefited from incremental organic sales related to our recently completed client list acquisition, with this strong second half performance in fiscal 2019, following a strong second half performance in fiscal 2018, we anticipate a difficult compare in the latter half of fiscal 2020.Our Employer Services revenue retention rate is another important indicator of the health of our business. And as you will recall, this is the first year we provided guidance for it. We are pleased to now report an improvement in our retention rate of 40 basis points to 90.8% in 2019, which was in line with our expectations. This increase was driven primarily by our midmarket business, which is benefiting from rising NPS scores following the completion of our platform migrations in late fiscal 2018, continuous investments in our Workforce Now platform and service related transformation initiatives. This puts us closer to our all-time high of 91.4%, which is no small accomplishment given the amount of change we've been undergoing as an organization.Our strategy is working, and on a broader level our efforts over the past three years to improve the service ability of our clients by migrating them to our strategic cloud-based software solutions and simplifying the service experience, while also closing sub-scale locations and transforming our client service model through our service alignment initiatives have contributed to improvements in our client satisfaction scores in overall service costs. You will hear more from Kathleen shortly on some of our more recent transformation related investments and anticipated benefits. But before that, I would like to briefly discuss some of our recent efforts around our product and innovation.The global human capital management market is strong and continues to benefit from an evolving regulatory landscape that increasingly elevates the value of HR as a strategic business partner. At our June 2018 Investor Day, we shared how we intend to position ourselves to take advantage of some of these trends. One such trend is the evolution of payments were employers increasingly recognize the need for differentiated payments and financial wellness offerings in order to attract and retain talent. A recent study by the ADP Research Institute identified that nearly 80% of employers in North America believe that companies will need to customize their employee payment options to remain competitive in the war for talent. While two-thirds of employees say off-cycle pay options such as the ability to choose pay frequency would make a difference when considering a job offer.At ADP, we continue to invest in new solutions in the tackling is evolving trends with ADP's wisely pay we are enabling our clients to provide their employees with a fully electronic and proprietary payment solution which we complement through our financial wellness tool the my wisely companion mobile app. Recently, we enhanced our electronic payment functionality with the launch of widely now, which helps organizations and their HR departments address compliance risks by bringing automation to Instant Payments such as off-cycle and termination fee. With these solutions organizations can leverage ADP's compliance expertise to pay unscheduled or off-cycle employee wages in order to meet the diverse range of local employer requirements.Tight labor markets -- the tight labor market has also increased the importance of recruiting. Organizations are increasingly looking to utilize technology that enable a more seamless and effective recruitment process. Providing employers in an integrated offering that equips the recruiters with tools that effectively identify and connect with top talent is therefore paramount and helping them stay ahead of the competition. It is with this objective in mind that ADP recently integrated ADP recruiting management, our all-in-one automated recruiting platform with LinkedIn recruiter system connect. The integration allows recruiters to easily export basic profile data into ADP recruiting management while servicing critical candidate information in real-time into Linkedln recruiter.With this integration, recruiters have access to everything they need in a single time saving workflow without the inconvenience of manual data entry, moving between systems or repetitive candidate outreach. Innovations like these demonstrate our commitment to delivering best-in-class products, and earlier this month, we were pleased to be recognized by both NelsonHall and Everest Group as a leader in their respective recruitment process outsourcing assessments. This is just one example of how most mid-and large-sized businesses today use multiple systems and vendors to manage their workforce needs. The seamless integration of solutions is critical to ensuring that employee experience is executed flawlessly.As the HCM markets largest digital source for people management solutions, ADP Marketplace enables employers to build this more flexible HR ecosystem to fit their needs. This approach to providing an open ecosystem is integral to our open API strategy, and is a foundation for our next generation HCM solutions. We were therefore pleased this quarter to host our second Annual ADP marketplace partner summit, which allowed us to recognize our partners for the creativity and success of their solutions, while also allowing them to share in best practices. We are proud to have been the first HCM vendor to launch a marketplace and we're pleased this year to see our total number of partners grow by 33% with ADP Marketplace now offering almost 370 solutions across the HCM spectrum, representing 40% growth over the past 12 months.Let me conclude my remarks by saying that our evolution towards becoming an HCM technology company that provides great service would not be possible without the dedication of our associates, who are integral and helping us accelerate our pace of change. We are proud of their efforts to deliver innovative solutions like these to our clients and for their efforts to ensure the success of our transformation initiatives.And with that, I'll turn it over to Kathleen for her commentary on our results in the fiscal 2020 outlook. Kathleen Winters : Thank you, Carlos, and good morning to everyone on the call. As Carlos said, we're pleased with our financial results for the year. We continue to make progress in delivering leading cloud-based software solutions to our clients and improving the client experience through our ongoing service and transformation initiatives. Our focus on delivering top-line revenue growth while also improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations in order to drive sustainable long-term value creation is working.This morning, we reported full-year revenue growth in line with our expectations at 6% on a reported basis and 7% on an organic constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBIT increased 15% in with ahead of our expectations. Adjusted EBIT margin was up about 160 basis points compared to fiscal 2018, and included 30 basis points of unfavorability from acquisitions. This margin improvement benefited from both discrete larger transformation initiatives and various operating efficiencies. The details of which I will now take you through.First, we completed a voluntary early retirement program with an annualized recurring cost saving of $150 million in line with our original expectations. However, due to the timing of our backfill hiring we realize the full benefit in fiscal 2019. We do not expect any incremental savings from this initiative in fiscal 2020.Second, this year, we fully realize the remaining benefits from our service alignment initiative. Having completed our hiring needs in fiscal 2018, we exited the remainder of our previously identified 68 subscale service locations for an annualized recurring cost saving of approximately $60 million. This was in line with our expectations as we achieved most of these cost savings in fiscal 2018, while fiscal 2019 benefited from the lapping of approximately $20 million in dual operating costs.Finally, following our recent platform migration efforts this year, we also saw continued benefits from efficiencies within our IT infrastructure. These cost savings initiatives were further supplemented by a number of smaller more tactical transformation projects that have collectively helped to drive productivity improvements across the business. Some examples of these initiatives include an enhanced client relationship management system. Our ongoing investments to automate manual tasks and elevating the use of artificial intelligence, which together help reduce contacts per client. The benefits from these initiatives were partially offset by the investments in our new brand platform and growth in selling expenses.Our adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 23.8% and benefited from the impact of the lower federal statutory tax rate due to corporate tax reform, partially offset by the loss of certain tax deductions. This rate compares to our 26.2% adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal 2018. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 20% to $5.45 and in addition to benefiting from our revenue growth, margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate was also aided by fewer shares outstanding compared to a year ago.Now for our segment results. For Employer Services, revenues were in line with expectations and grew 5% reported and organic constant currency. As a reminder, this fiscal year we experienced approximately one percentage point of benefit from the impact of acquisitions, which was offset by the impact of FX. Interest income on client funds grew 20% and benefited from a 30 basis point improvement in the average yield earned on our client fund investments to 2.2% and growth in average client funds balances of 5% to $25.5 billion. This growth in balances was driven by a combination of client growth, wage inflation and growth in our pays per control, partially offset by lower SUI collections. Our same-store pays per control metric in the US grew 2.7% for the fiscal year.Moving on to Employer Services margin, we saw an increase of about 230 basis points in the year, which included approximately 50 basis points of unfavorability from the impact of acquisitions. The strength of our performance this year was enabled by some of the same factors that I mentioned earlier when discussing our consolidated results. PEO revenues grew 9% for the year to $4.2 billion with average worksite employees growing 8% to 547,000 both in line with our expectations.Revenues excluding the impact of zero margin benefit pass-throughs grew 8% to $1.5 billion, also in line with expectations despite continued pressure from lower workers' compensation and SUI pricing. Margins increased 60 basis points for the year due to operating efficiency within the business and benefits from our voluntary early retirement program. We also saw a better than expected changes to our ADP indemnity loss reserve estimates with about 10 basis points of unfavorable year-over-year impact in fiscal 2019 as compared to our previous estimate of 25 basis points.We are pleased with the strength of our results in fiscal 2019. And with the year now behind us, I want to share a few thoughts related to our balance sheet, cash flow and financial liquidity. We have a robust business model with high levels of operating cash flow, our strategy is to leverage the strengths of our model to reinforce our competitive position by first and foremost reinvesting in the business. We believe that balancing investments in innovative solutions, client service tools and distribution is critical and helping to strengthen our market leading offerings. And we supplement these investments through a disciplined approach to M&A. We also remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends and disciplined share buybacks. And this year, we returned approximately $2.2 billion. Finally, our strong balance sheet multiple sources of liquidity and AA credit ratings all help support our $2.2 trillion in global client money movement operations and our investment strategy for our client fund's portfolio.Let's now move to our fiscal 2020 outlook. Starting with Employer Services, we expect 4% to 5% revenue growth in our Employer Services segment, which includes anticipated pays per control growth of about 2.5%. We also expect Employer Services new business bookings growth up 6% to 8% and for our Employer Services revenue retention to improve 10 basis points to 20 basis points.Moving on to margins; we expect margin in our Employer Services segment to expand by 100 basis points to 125 basis points. Our margin growth continues to benefit from a combination of operating leverage together with the impact from our various transformation initiatives.Regarding our PEO segment, we expect 9% to 11% PEO revenue growth in fiscal 2020 and 7% to 9% growth in PEO revenues excluding zero margin health care benefit pass-throughs, both driven by an anticipated growth of 7% to 9% in average worksite employees. We're pleased with the strength of our PEO bookings in fiscal 2019. But healthcare inflation remains high and as we anticipated, we experienced volatility and some churn in our fourth quarter. Accordingly, we anticipate being on the lower end of our average worksite employee guidance range at the beginning of the year, with a gradual reacceleration of our growth rate as the year progresses.We meanwhile continue to expect lower workers' compensation and SUI pricing to have an impact on our total PEO revenue growth. For PEO margin following a strong fiscal 2019, we anticipate margins to be flat to down 25 basis points in fiscal 2020, which includes approximately 50 basis points of unfavorability from adjustments to our ADP indemnity loss reserve estimates.I'll go now to the consolidated outlook. We anticipate total revenue growth of 6% to 7% in fiscal 2020. This outlook contemplates interest income on client funds of approximately $580 million to $590 million and net interest income from our extended investment strategy of $585 million to $595 million. This outlook is approximately $30 million lower than our June 2018 Investor Day estimates for fiscal 2020.With that said, we expect to overcome some of this interest income pressure through operating efficiency, and we anticipate adjusted EBIT margin to increase 100 basis points to 125 basis points in fiscal 2020. With more expansion in the second half of fiscal 2020 given our very strong first half margin performance in fiscal '19. In addition to benefiting from our operating leverage our fiscal 2020 margin growth is anticipated to benefit from the following two transformation initiatives.First, during the fourth quarter of fiscal '19, we recorded a severance charge of approximately $26 million related to a broad-based workforce optimization effort focused on spans of control and management layers throughout the organization. Second, this year we're accelerating our procurement transformation efforts through a number of initiatives aimed at third-party vendors and internal expense management. These two initiatives combined are expected to generate about $100 million of savings in fiscal 2020. We anticipate our adjusted effective tax rate to be 23.8% in line with last year, this rate includes about 50 basis points of estimated excess tax benefit from stock based compensation related to restricted stock vesting in Q1 of fiscal 2020, but it does not include any estimated tax benefit related to potential stock option exercises. Given the dependency of that benefit on the timing of exercises. We expect growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share of 12% to 14% in fiscal 2020.I'll now share a few thoughts resulting from the discussions that I've had with some of you doing my first few months here at ADP. At our June 2018 Investor Day, we set target ranges through fiscal '21, and we've been pleased with our progress to date. In particular, we are pleased with how our associates have responded to the challenges that we have set and with how the business is executing on our strategic plan. It's now been a little over a year since we share those targets, and a few things have happened since then, including the adoption of ASC 606. Therefore, we felt it might be helpful to share a couple of reminders.First, you will recall that we based on our Investor Day targets on ASC 605, and we provided you with the anticipated ASC 606 impacts to margins. Second, our growth targets were baseline off of the mid-point of our fiscal 2018 guidance at the time and we subsequently reported our fiscal 2018 results better that exceeded our expectations. So although we are not providing a re-issuance or an update of the targets we provided at our June 2018 Investor Day. To better assist you in today's earnings presentation you will find a recast and walk of certain of our Investor Day targets using fiscal 2018 reported results and the ASC 606 basis of accounting.Taking a step back, we are pleased with our performance in fiscal 2019. And we continue to make great progress on our transformation initiatives. We have a lot of opportunities ahead of us and we're excited to continue to challenge ourselves to become an even stronger organization.With that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Jason Kupferberg : Good morning, guys. I just wanted to start maybe on the bookings side of things, just looking at the fiscal '20 guidance. It's actually in line with your typical annual target even though you do have that tough grow over as was highlighted in your prepared remarks, especially in the second half. So I just wanted to see if you can go into the visibility on that target. I mean it's a stronger guide than we were expecting in light of the comp issue just maybe deconstruct the market a bit in terms of where you see that sustained strength coming from. And as part of that, if you can just clarify what the bookings contribution in Q4 was from the quasi-acquisition, if you will? Carlos Rodriguez : Sure. Let me just start by the -- I guess the first part of the question and then maybe Kathleen can address the quantification in terms of the numbers in the fourth quarter. But we look at a number of -- I guess, objective things in terms of trying to come up with our bookings forecast for the next year. As you know, that is the number that we have the least visibility on, because it's unlike the rest of our business which is recurring revenue. This is every week, every month, every quarter, start from zero in terms of new business bookings. But having said that, we have a lot of historical information around. For example, sales force productivity, so we call sales per diem or average sales productivity and then we have the number of sales people that we have hired into the system over the past three or four months, and so that, that all goes into a model and you add on top of that are feeling some subjectivity around new product strength and in some cases may be acquired products that we have and that's really how we come up with our number for bookings. So I think borrowing changes in the economy and borrowing kind of -- some kind of external shock or factor. We've been doing this way for decades and it works. We have a certain amount of head count that we had, we have a certain amount of productivity that we drive toward then we change our incentives and ratchet them up in order to drive those productivity improvements. And then we have kind of new products that we introduced to try to help our sales force get that productivity and also help us competitively in the marketplace.So all other factors remain relatively constant. Even though there are tweaks here and there, depending on the segments, but no big changes in pricing, no big changes to report on kind of other fronts other than as you insinuated kind of business as usual. Although that underestimates the difficulty of selling the amount of new business bookings that we have to sell every year in order to hit our target. But that gives you a little bit of a flavor of how we kind of build our planet's -- it's a tried and tested approach and we did have a little bit of a challenge because of the grow over from the fourth quarter client acquisition list, but we feel good about our momentum and I think our headcount adds were probably in the 4% range, I think it was. I'm not sure with the exact number was, but our head count is exactly where that's the one variable historically it would behind in hiring that can generally create an issue for us and if we are in good shape on hiring or even ahead of the game, it gives us a little bit more confidence and I think we're exiting the year fully staffed and I think with a good head count in our sales organization. And I know, Kathleen, if you want to address? Kathleen Winters : Yes. And maybe I'll just also comment a little bit on the process having come in and been here for a couple of months now and coming in with a fresh set of eyes or different set of eyes looking at the process. I mean, I can attest to the very detailed bottoms up process that we go through in terms of, as Carlos said, looking at head count looking at productivity improvements. How does new product functionality or new product add to the growth. What is the market conditions look like. I mean, we've kicked the tires on this process and is a really, really solid process. I'm really happy to see that. In terms of the year-over-year and the growth of -- particularly the client list acquisition. I mean, look, we're really, really pleased with how the organization, sales organization performed and the end result for fiscal 2019, it's a little hard to exactly parse out and identify the exact impact of that client list acquisition. Because we think about it in terms of look it's truly organic, we've got a sales force and sales associates that we've had to dedicate to go out and work those conversions and close those sales on balance we're just really happy with the outcome we had in 2019. And we think we've got a really very balanced and solid outlook for 2020. Carlos Rodriguez : And so -- I just went back and listen my notes, our head count actually is a little bit stronger is around, a little bit over 5% in terms of. So that's actually probably better than historical norm and we did have conversations about six months ago that given the discussions out in the external market about the economy and difficulties potentially -- difficulties with the economy is before, obviously, the discussions about lower rates etc. And we decided that we're going to take a little bit of an insurance policy and add a little bit more headcount in our sales organization. So I think we're entering the year in a very good position from a headcount standpoint. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. Christian Greyenbuhl : Jason, I would just add briefly to that to Carlos' point about headcount investments, they are in put more focused on inside sales, which is in line with what we outlined at our Investor Day that we were going to try focused on. Carlos Rodriguez : And one last comment about that, because I think you referred to as a quasi-acquisition. So it was just to be clear was -- we bought the right to convert clients and so every single client had to be resold and re-implemented. We bought no platforms, no assets, no people, just to be clear, because that was a very difficult and an incredibly well execute is probably one of the best executed initiatives I've ever seen. That was months and months of planning, and it was executed virtually flawlessly. Jason Kupferberg : Okay, that's really good color. I just wanted to switch gears for a second over to PEO. I mean, if we just reflect back on the Analyst Day last year. I think, the three year revenue guidance to the CAGR there on PEO was 11% to 14% if memory serves. I know we did 9% in year one, and at the midpoint in year two, I think we're looking at about 10%. So how should we perhaps recalibrate our expectations a little bit in terms of what the realistic three year CAGR is, and at the end of the day, is that just attributable more to variations in the WSE growth as opposed to some of the pass-through pieces or the SUI pricing as you reflect on kind of what the thought process was a year plus ago versus today. Carlos Rodriguez : Sure. So for 2019, as Kathleen was talking about things that we needed to kind of provide some clarification on from Investor Day, because as time goes on more things change so ASC 606 was one of the things that we highlighted. But another thing that we've tried to highlight every quarter since the fiscal year started in '19, because given the timing when we gave our Investor Day guidance it was June, and it was really just a month later that our benefits billing cycle changes for our PEO. In other words are open enrollment takes place because of the way our fiscal year works that's when our renewals take place in our PEO and that's when we give visibility really to the biggest pass-through which is a zero margin benefit pass-through.And as we mentioned last year around this time, we were pleasantly surprised have gotten kind of given what was happening with healthcare inflation, low health care renewals, lower than we had anticipated, certainly in our Investor Day. Again zero margin, so no impact on EPS, but certainly had an impact on growth in '19 of total PEO revenue. We also had a renewal of our workers' compensation policy that ended up being again lower than we had anticipated. That was a smaller impact in the zero margin health care benefits pass-through. But the combination of those two items is really the largest component of the difference between Investor Day guidance in 2019 PEO performance.Now, we move on to 2020. Now you start to get the impact of what is a combination of that -- of the slower pass-through growth, but also slightly slower worksite employee growth, so it's really a combination of those two factors. I just want to give you a little bit of color, because it depends on '19 versus '20. And as Kathleen mentioned in her prepared remarks in '20 our health care renewals, which we do now have come in line with historical expectations. So that portion for 2020 is more in line with what we've had historically. So '19 was really the anomaly when it comes to zero margin, pass-through, but we still have pressure from workers' compensation pricing coming down and SUI pass-through also coming down in 2020.And again, these zero margin or low margin pass-through costs coming down in cost or price is generally a good thing competitively for the PEO. So it has relatively small impact on the overall profitability of the PEO and very little impact on the overall profitability of ADP. But certainly impacts the headline revenue number. Jason Kupferberg : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffetNathanson. Lisa Ellis : Hi, good morning, guys. And great results. Here, if I would call correctly, I believe your new high-end product is in beta testing with a handful of clients. Could you -- as really peaking out into 2020 now. Could you give us an update on where you are in that rollout? What type of feedback you're hearing what features our clients liking the most about that product and kind of what's the timeline for the rollout? Thank you. Carlos Rodriguez : Sure. You're obvious -- as you can imagine, we're very excited about we've been for several years working on a solution that will really address some of the needs in the market that are unmet today. We just as a little bit of color before I get into that, keep in mind that we also have our Workforce Now platform that we've brought up into the upmarket space, which has really helped us competitively quite a bit. There is a segment of the market where Workforce Now works very well for larger clients, if those larger clients are \"simpler\" and don't have kind of global needs and relatively simple benefits needs. And so, it's been a two-pronged approach in the interim of using continuing to use Vantage and investing in Vantage and also bringing Workforce Now up into the upmarket. Those two things in combination I think have led to -- we consider to be good unit growth in the upmarket, which is very satisfying for us.But obviously, we believe there's a lot of upside with our new Lifion platform. And so, this is the first year where we've had clients in pilot. We do have a sales team, which we have expanded just very recently. So we are not in general availability, but we are selling new clients, and I would say that our sales expectations have -- I think it's safe to say, been in line to maybe even exceeded our expectations. So we're very happy on that front. But now we have a lot of work ahead of us, because we've got, I believe it's about four or five clients that are implemented and live, and obviously in the agile development approach we are continuing to improve and add to the platform as we bring on clients. And so, we're just in this gradual process of making sure that we can get to the point where we can have exponential growth of the platform and for that we need to make sure that we are fully ready with our implementation resources that we've been adding sales people. We've been adding implementation resources, and I think 2020 is a year where we expect to get traction in the market, particularly in the second half of the year.But again, the caution of course is given ADP's size and our $14 billion in revenue. This is not something that is a one or two year horizon story, this is in terms of impact on ADP is a very, it's a long-term investment and is expected to have a very long-term and positive impact on our competitiveness. But we shouldn't be expecting if -- in fact, I would say, it's fair to say that, in the short term it really create some financial pressure, because we're putting a lot of the -- besides the R&D investments that we've made over the last four years or five years. Now we're investing heavily in sales distribution and implementation. And as you know, especially in the upmarket that doesn't translate into revenues until 6, 12, 18 months down the road depending on the size and complexity of the client. Kathleen Winters : Yes. So we did -- we had given a range of sales units that we had expected and we were at the high end of that range that we had given as Carlos said, we've been adding to sales and implementation team there, but we'll continue to do so during the course of 2020 for sure. So yes, we'll start to get more feedback during the course of the year as we do these pilots with the clients and we'll keep you updated on that. Carlos Rodriguez : And I think, since you -- I think, very specifically talking about Lifion. But I think it's worth also mentioned, we have couple of other next-gen projects that are progressing quite well as well. One of them is more back office or tax engine, but it's very exciting, because, I think, it should lead to some real scale and efficiency gains there and more flexibility for our service organization also for our clients. But our new payroll next generation payroll solution is also kind of progressing well. I think we have around a dozen clients again in pilot. That's it also a global platform with a rules-based engine. We are very excited about that in terms of the flexibility that it will give us in terms of our core business around payroll and that's also progressing quite well. And I think we are intending to ramp up our sales, implementation resources on that front also. Lisa Ellis : Okay. Well, I'm excited about your new tax engine. Different topic, in your 2020 guidance, you're forecasting again about 2.5% pays per control growth, which implies a pretty robust outlook on the US economy. Can you highlight what you're seeing in your underlying numbers that's giving you that level of confidence as you look out into 2020. Thanks. Carlos Rodriguez : It's a very fair question. I'd say the -- given that we're not economists and don't have a crystal ball, probably the biggest factor we look at is trend and momentum. And I think we had 2.7% in the fourth quarter if I'm not mistaken, just to check. And I think it was two point something -- 2.8% before that. So we're believers that when it comes to the economy, the economy behaves somewhat similar to ADP, which is things don't change that quickly overnight, unless there is of course, some kind of external shocks. So could that number end up exiting at a lower rate by the end of the year due to an economic slowdown. I mean, that's up to the economists to the forecasting to predict, but based on what we're seeing like in the trends and the momentum we just issued our employment report actually this morning, and it was once again, I think, kind of in the target if you will, I think it was 150-something thousand jobs. So it feels like there is still some gas in the tank, and when you look at labor force participation we do, even though we're not economists, we do look at these things. And yes, unemployment is very low and that should make it a little bit harder to find people, but there are still a lot of people out there. And I know there explanations around the baby boomers retiring and so forth, but it appears every month that we and the government everyone else is surprised by the ability to bring more people into the workforce. So we think that at least for the next couple of quarters that feels like a good bet. And I think, beyond that probably up to the economists. Lisa Ellis : Perfect, thank you. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Bryan Keane : Hi, guys, just wanted to ask on employee services growth. I know at the Analyst Day we talked about 5% to 6%, it's only modestly different now 4% to 5%. And just a different factors going into that guide now from what we've learned over the last year. And also I think, Kathleen, you talked a little bit about beating expectations and revenue which had some impact as well? Thanks. Carlos Rodriguez : Yes, I think there are -- let Kathleen talk about the math, but just as an overall big picture. Again, as we get further away from Investor Day, there's a lot of things that go into the mix for Employer Services. For example, we do now include client funds interest in Employer Services. And so, we're getting slightly less contribution from that in '20 versus Investor Day and versus '19. We also have a little bit of FX pressure that obviously, it's not something that we forecasted an Investor Day. So I think those generally would explain, I think over the two years of '19 and '20, I would say that Employer Services growth is in line with Investor Day. Kathleen Winters : Yes, I don't really have anything to add further. I mean, those are the factors, as Carlos mentioned, that is various puts and takes. But generally in line with those expectations. Bryan Keane : Okay. And just as a follow-up one to ask about the M&A pipeline and what you guys might be looking at to continue to add and supplement to the portfolio? Thanks so much. Carlos Rodriguez : Well, we, this fourth quarter client list acquisition that we made I think, piqued our interest in using our capital in more than just kind of the traditional organic fashion. And we did do a few acquisitions. If you recall, we acquired Global Cash Card. We just acquired Celergo, WorkMarket. So we planned to some seeds, and some of those were really investments in the future. So, call it, two, three, five, 10 years down the road WorkMarket as an example. We're incredibly excited about our strategically, but it's just because of its size and relation to the size of ADP. Today, it doesn't really change the numbers a lot, but it could down the road, it's a very large market for freelancers out there so.So the question is, besides that, or the things that we can use our capital for that would have a greater impact on the kind of short-term revenue, if you will, and we're certainly interested in looking. But we're also highly disciplined right in terms of requiring the right kinds of returns. And as you know, the bar for us is -- one of our bars is that we are trying to avoid adding a lot of additional platforms, because we've been working very, very hard to rationalize platforms and the migrate clients onto our strategic platforms. So that does create a little bit of a high bar, but it doesn't mean that we wouldn't be willing some extraordinary circumstance to make an exception of was a very strategic opportunity, we may be willing to spend the time and the effort to migrate clients off of an existing platform onto our platform, like we did with Global Cash Card as an example. Bryan Keane : Okay, helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Marcon with R. W. Baird. Your line is open. Mark Marcon : Good morning. You have really nice progress with regards to the client retention improvement. I'm wondering if you can talk about how broad base that was, it sounds like there is really good improvement on the midmarket? But wondering to what extent that extended to the other areas. And then, you're looking for some more improvement going forward. I'm wondering if that's expected to be broad based or how we should think about that? Carlos Rodriguez : So, yes, a little bit of color is that the reason we called out as we usually do, we try to call at the one or two things that are the most significant in terms of moving the numbers, but whether it's retention or other parts of our business -- the rest of the business is performing relatively well, it's very hard to generate that kind of improvement. So in terms of additional color, in our SBS business, as an example, we had record high retention, but it was off of what was already a very high retention rate. So, what I'll call it modest improvement in retention, but frankly very satisfying, because we're trying to -- we're trying to stay away from quarterly or specific business segment discussions about retention, because there is, there can be volatility in those numbers. But to see the SBS retention improve on top of where they already were after five years of improvement was very satisfying.But the real standout was really our midmarket business and it really performed according to script. So we -- as you know, we once had some very difficult times in 2017 with a combination of ACA have been happening right in the middle of what we're trying to migrate our clients off of our legacy platforms onto our current version of Workforce Now. And what we said at the time was that we wanted to -- the script was and we wanted to follow what happened in our downmarket business where we consolidated and migrated all of our clients onto one single platform called run, and after that for four or five years we had very healthy increases in retention, very healthy increases in new business bookings and just great performance in this business around margins and so, for fiscal year '19 we're very happy that our midmarket business followed that part of the script of really taking the benefits of a simpler environment both for our associates and for our clients and we're hoping that there is more gas in the tank.And in the rest of the business performed, I would say, well, we don't have any -- I don't think there any places where we have -- we will rise to the occasion of us mentioning that we had a big dip in retention in Employer Services. Mark Marcon : That's great. And then, it sounds like there's a lot of excitement around on demand pay. I'm wondering when we think about the concept and the promise that that hold. How should we gauge that relative to being realistic in terms of when it's actually going to really generate material revenue? How do you envision that rolling out over the next two to five years? Carlos Rodriguez : My instinct would tell me slowly and with very little impact, but it could be important competitively. And so, I think being able to provide these solutions in a market where again we already have a very large new business bookings number, and we have every year to grow that, that number we need up every weapon in the arsenal. So we are still very positive and optimistic about that business. And, but over the course of a couple of years, I would say, I would have modest expectations around financial impact. Longer term, we have a lot of -- we didn't buy Global Cash Card without keeping in the back of our minds that this was a potential very large opportunity for us down the road. But again, I hate to sound like a broken record, but in relation to the size of ADP, we look at all these things over the course of three, five, seven years rather than what's it going to do in the next couple of years. Mark Marcon : All right. I appreciate that. And then lastly, just on the PEO side, any changes in the market that you can discern Carlos with regards to just when we take a look at on WSE growth and how we should expect trends to unfold or any regional differences anything that's changed with regards to the promise there? Carlos Rodriguez : No, I mean, I think it's still, it's still a little bit of the same, a similar story where we do say in the industry says the same thing every year, but it's still true that it's a relatively under penetrated market. So I think there is no, there is no lack of opportunity in terms of addressable market out there. I think the key is really being very disciplined about your health care and you're workers compensation, so that you have a truly long-term sustainable and viable business model. And I think we've tried to follow that approach by taking no risk on our health benefits and being very disciplined and careful on workers comp or we have indemnity which is run by corporate, which provides the pricing to our PEO, and frankly where we also offload most of that risk.As you know in our 10-K, we fully disclose the way we color basically that risk to a relatively small number. So I think the key is just really focusing on the value proposition and not getting distracted by the short-term fluctuations in volatility of health care costs. And I think, that's served us well, and that's we're going to continue to do. We have obviously inherent advantage in -- that we try to exploit of having a very large installed base and a very large referral network called the ADP sales force outside of the PEO. And so, you heard us talk last year about tweaking these incentives in the midmarket. We had great results from that. We had double-digit growth and referrals from our midmarket business. I think you saw it translate into really good results and our new business bookings. I think we talked about double-digit bookings growth in the PEO for the year.So we're feeling pretty good about the PEO business and I think nothing that I can see has changed dramatically. The environment compared to three or four years ago, there is less rhetoric around -- regulatory issues and obviously ACA people go back and forth on that, but there is enough state and local regulation that small companies deal with that. It's a target rich environment for whether it's a PPO or some of our other traditional services. It's very hard to be a small employer out there. Mark Marcon : I appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Samad Samana : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I'm curious when you think about the $1.6 billion of bookings that you added in -- in fiscal '19. I'm curious maybe you can give some color on the composition, when you think about it as core payroll versus some of the additional offerings that are in Employer Services. What was particularly strong and what drove the outperformance relative to expectations. And then I have one follow-up question. Carlos Rodriguez : I'm sorry. Back to the beginning of your question, you're telling about 2019? Samad Samana : Yes, of fiscal '19 as you think about the strong bookings performance within Employer Services. If you think by product or by the services that are offered in Employer Services was there anything that stood out in particular -- as particularly strong and/or that drove the outperformance. Carlos Rodriguez : Yes. And I think we were kind of generally in line with the last couple of years about where we were in terms of about 60-40 in terms of the breakdown between new and upsell opportunity, and that's kind of not that far off from our historic numbers. A couple of other places where we had good results, we talked about SBS in the down market, they were on a great trajectory to begin with. And I think the client list conversion \"acquisition\" that we did at the end of the year helped that even more. So we had just really great results in SBS, but our International business did well, also particularly because of the MNC multinational sales that we have with global view Celergo streamline. So that was also a big positive. And frankly, our domestic upmarket business did pretty well, we had a good, they had a good year on new business bookings. So we were pleased with that. So we had -- I would say, probably SBS is probably the standout with some tailwind because of the client list acquisition. But I think we had broad based strength. Samad Samana : Great. And then just a follow-up on the additional $26 million in savings expected from the changes internally to the structure to make things more streamlined. I'm curious if that's something that's part of a more to come, or is that what maybe the last of what you see as restructuring that's needed as part of driving efficiencies or how should we think about that in the context of that new $26 million and then with the $150 million of savings driven by the -- is there additional efficiencies that the company seems that can drive from that perspective. Thanks again for taking my question. Kathleen Winters : Yes, thanks for the questions, Samad. Just to clarify, the $26 million was the charge we took the severance charge in Q4 of 2019 related to the workforce optimization, if you will efforts in terms of span -- looking at spans and layers. And so forth, that will drive in addition to that plus the procurement work we're doing will drive about $100 million of savings in fiscal 2020. Carlos Rodriguez : And I would say that, just to add a little bit of color to you, because your comment about are we done with kind of trying to look for efficiency gains or we done with the restructuring. The answer is no. I think that -- very large complex global organization and I think we have a lot of opportunity for improvement. We probably always will. But I think in the short-term, we have a lot of opportunity just because of what we're seeing with the capabilities of our new platforms as an example, they really -- I think highlight the opportunities we have for automation for digitization and for efficiency. And so we intend to continue to stay on that path here for some time to come. So I think we're -- the answer is, we're not done. I think, we are still working on that. Kathleen Winters : Yes, I mean, and just kind of add-on to a little bit more there is really a lot of energy and alignment. And those two things together really important, a lot of energy and alignment in the organization around doing this transformation work on those. It's a lot of hard work, there's a lot of execution work going on, but there's also a lot of work around developing the pipeline. What is the next set of projects that we're doing in areas like, is there potentially more on procurement, is there more in terms of how we utilize our facilities automation projects. I think there is a whole host of things that we can look at here. Samad Samana : Great. That's really helpful color. Thanks again for added additional detail. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from David [ph] with Stifel. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Carlos, you've done a good job of outlining how the operational changes system in there that ADP over the last two years as well as describing the new product initiatives underway. How should we think about which of these will be most impactful to revenue growth over the next 12 to 24 months. Carlos Rodriguez : I don't mean to insult you, but I don't spend a lot of time thinking about the next 12 months, because the -- like, this thing is a ADP is that from a recurring revenue standpoint, the momentum that we have is hopefully discernible right in terms of when you look at retention, you look at new business bookings and you look at the momentum of our business. And we tend to spend more time on the kind of 24 months and beyond timeframe. But having said that, I think some of the recent acquisitions that we made over the last couple of years. I think our -- strengthening our product line, I think that the next-generation products that are actually really getting sold now and getting implemented have the ability to start really moving the needle on new business bookings. But those have relatively modest impacts on our overall revenues, just because of the size of the business. So it's not because of lack of excitement around the things that we are doing that I say that, that the 12-month horizon is really not something that I spend a lot of time on. It's just because of the math in terms of the way the math operates. But I think that we have a number of things that we've been working on for, and it's not really just over the last couple of years. We focused a lot on the last couple of years around kind of increasing the pace of change moving faster and also becoming a little bit more incrementally efficient whether it's through the voluntarily retirement through the strategic alignment initiative or some of the other things that we've done.But I think our sales force, our products and the rest of our business continues to execute at a very high level. Unfortunately, now we're getting that the benefit of those -- that execution plus we're getting reasonable margin improvement, because of some of these actions that we've taken. So we're very happy and very satisfied with the performance and I don't expect to be any less satisfied over the next 12 months. Unidentified Analyst : Right. I think that fair. The question was operationally, obviously, you've done a great job, which is impacted retention and service levels, which obviously impacts also new sales. I guess I'm trying to understand whether or not some of the product initiatives could in fact be more impactful, if you will over the next 24 months or so, or do you think it's going to be just kind of an even kind of contribution as it's always been over the last several years. Carlos Rodriguez : Well, since you mentioned 24 months, that's a different story. So I do think that given the ramp and the kind of the lines that we have on the charts on the grass, if you will, what we expect from our next-gen products. I would expect that over the 24-month horizon, there will be a measurable impact particularly on new business bookings from next-gen. But in the kind of the 12-month timeframe, the things we've done for example around moving Workforce Now into the upmarket. I think it has been incredibly impactful and helpful in the upmarket competitively for us. We're also using our Workforce Now platform in the PEO now and in our HRO business, which has been incredibly impactful. So now we have a very large next-gen platform, because we consider Workforce Now to be next-gen as well and to be out there competitively. So that's very helpful. This retention improvement that we've talked about beneath the surface of that is really big improvements and NPS scores, client satisfaction and referenceability. And I think that probably got alone has the single biggest potential impact on our sales force and our growth because we have a very large distribution network out there. And any improvement in productivity for them because of any kind of tailwind, and I think that reputation and referenceability and client satisfaction provide that tailwind, I think can really move the needle.And then lastly, the run platform our downmarket platform just continues to execute incredibly well and they continue to innovate and we have a couple of things cooking there as well in terms of things in the downmarket that we think could also strengthen our hand in the marketplace as well there. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thanks for that clarification. And just one other question, really just on cyclicality. I just looking at the headlines and we will report this morning and some of the reports from paychecks in their monthly reports over the last several months, it looks like small business hiring is challenged with the tight labor markets. And is that typical for this stage of the cycle? And have you seen any impact of that in your downmarket business or the fee? Carlos Rodriguez : I -- you kept that a little bit of a disadvantage, I don't think I even looked at my own employment report, I look at the headline number, which is 150-something thousand, but it sounds like there was something about small business employment slowing there, but I don't -- I think that based on kind of the trend, if you will over multiple months. I don't think there's anything really to read there. It is true that our pays per control number comes largely as a -- from a subset of our auto pay, payroll engine, which is does not include SBS. But we're not really seeing anything -- I mean our impact would be -- we would feel it, if there was a big issue in SBS, we have pays per control growth in SBS of 1.7 for the year. Not sure if I have prior years that I could compare that to, but it's positive, and it's growing. And the question about the cycle that we probably have some data around that it, I have to go back and look at, but that's probably more of a question for economists in terms of what turns down first is it large employer hiring or is a small business, hiring it's not sure that I have that one at the tip of my, on my fingertips, but there's really nothing, it's roughly comparable. So it's roughly comparable -- Unidentified Analyst : Last year's growth rate in SBS pays per control roughly comparable to this year. Carlos Rodriguez : Yes, pay per control -- yes, so, that feels similar-ish, it doesn't mean that it can fluctuate from month-to-month, because I don't want to contradict our employment report. But in this kind of economy, I just don't think that there is so much demand out there and you saw the consumer spending numbers and you see what's happening in the consumer sector, a lot of small business serve that part of the economy. It's just -- it's hard to believe that small business employment is going to have a dramatic slowdown here anytime in the near future. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from James Schneider with Goldman Sachs. James Schneider : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Carlos, good to see the retention improvement in fiscal '19, the 40 basis points. If you go back and look at fiscal '19 by segment downmarket and midmarket and upmarket. And clearly you've talked about the downmarket haven't done better for some time. Did the midmarket retention kind of performed to your expectations. And as you look into fiscal '20, what do you expect to kind of the line share the retention improvement come from? Carlos Rodriguez : The midmarket really outperformed our expectations in fiscal year '19, the way we build our plan for '20 is even though there are probably some tweaks here or there. We are getting back to kind of close to record high client retention, so there would be -- I would considered, I would call a modest improvements expected in various parts of our business and others kind of flattish, because we just want to be realistic about the potential for retention in the absence of for example, some large change. So as an example in the midmarket we expect further improvements because we continue to still get benefits from the migrations in the consolidation of our platforms there. Excuse me. Kathleen Winters : It's pretty modest, as we said 10 basis points to 20 basis points improvement for next year and spread pretty evenly across the board across the different market segments and there's always puts and takes, but it's pretty evenly spread in terms of where that improvement comes from and as you're at these high levels, and particularly in small business being at record highs. The higher you go the harder it is to get that incremental retention improvement, but obviously something we're continuing to focus on. Carlos Rodriguez : And just one last little piece of color. I didn't go back and look at where our retention rates were over the last, call it 10 years. And we are now at a higher retention rate, then we were pre-crisis. So if you look at '06 and '07, our retention rate was actually lower in Employer Services than it is today. Despite the fact that the mix of our business is more heavily tilted now towards our downmarket business than our upmarket business, and that's in large part as a result of the outperformance if you will. So we are downmarket business has grown faster over the last 10 years than our upmarket and midmarket business. And the downmarket business has a lower natural retention rate, just because of out of business in bankruptcy is and so forth. And so even though SBS is at record highs that retention rate we've told you before is still lower than the midmarket and the upmarket retention rate. So the fact that the overall ADP retention is higher today than it was pre-crisis, despite what is a very, a much larger downmarket business, I think it's impressive. James Schneider : It's good to see. And then on the PEO business. I think, Carlos, you called out a couple of items related to some increased client churn in the quarter. Can you may be kind of talk about what drove some of that was it. Specific offerings was a competitive, was a pricing, and I guess, how do you feel about kind of improving that metric going forward in the next couple of quarters? Carlos Rodriguez : That's a good question. We spent some time kind of trying to find the silver bullet there in terms of what kind of drove this. And I think it feels like some of it was the health care renewal, which is not out of line with historical norms and just remember that for us from a health care standpoint we take no risk on health care, so we pass-through whatever health care costs we have. I would say that '18 was the anomaly, where we had a lower-than-normal health care renewal and then now we are back to kind of a more normal health care renewal and that may have had some impact in terms of client shopping because it's a relatively large part of the overall employment, employer cost. But we looked at it, we sliced and diced by size of client by industry, by geography, etc. And it's hard to find a pattern. Now happen to think that's good news, because that means that we think it will potentially something that we can work our way out of and reaccelerate the growth there. But the renewals were actually in line with our expectations. So last year's when we were currently surprised with the old story of may be a little bit of a grow-over issue for the clients themselves because and we got a little over excited about the good news last year. Now, even though these healthcare inflation rates are back to kind of historical norms still compares to what was better the previous, the previous year. But there may be other noise that I'm not aware in the system, but I can't really put my finger on anything that's permanent or with what's kind of mentioning. James Schneider : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we have time for just one more question. And our next question will be from Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Tien- tsin Huang : Hi, thanks so much. I know it's getting late. Appreciate the time. Just on the margin outlook. I'm curious if we were to go back to the nice margin walk that you provided at the Analyst Day. Curious what's left to do to get to that 23%, 25%. I know you re-basing it here with 606 and what have you, but what's left to do another voluntary early retirements mostly done it sounds like service alignment mostly done where is the focus from here? Kathleen Winters : Yes. So, as we mentioned a little bit earlier, we've just been looking at kind of org structure, if you will. And looking at spans and layers and so that will benefit us. And I think where we're doing some procurement work, but I think there is a lot more to go on the procurement side. And as I said, the organization is really energized around not only executing what we have, but saying what else can we put in the pipeline? So we've got some things near term that will help us near term in the pipeline and then we're working really hard to say, okay, what helps us two years out and three years out, and after that, there could be a lot of automation work that we can do across the organization, whether it's front-line or back office. I think there is a lot yet to go in terms of identifying those opportunities. So a lot of execution work we still have to do and we'll be working a lot on identifying new things to. Carlos Rodriguez : I think to be a little bit more -- to be even more explicit the transformation office that we've set up. And I think, as Kathleen mentioned the whole management team, I think is committed to kind of this increased pace of change. I think that we've been talking about. So to be very clear, we actually have initiatives for '21 already. So we -- that's '21 that wasn't -- didn't misspeak there. So even though we're talking about '20 in terms of financial guidance we're meeting and talking now about things that we're working on during fiscal year 2020, that will have an impact on '21. And it's a number of different initiatives, we're not ready to talk about them because we're just not at that stage yet. But you should expect us to be talking about things that we're working on along the lines of what Kathleen mentioned, and we have those things already in process of getting ramped up and some of them require investments and that's built into our operating plan as well.On the negative side, even though we've done all these positive things back to the investor days. Since you were asking about Investor Day and getting to the margin, one thing is not going to help us is if interest rates stay at the same levels as they are today. That would be a reasonably heavy headwind for us in '21. If you go back to Investor Day, I think you can do the math we provided you with what we expected the balances to be and what the forward curves we're seeing at the time. And unfortunately the forward curves are saying something different now. Of course, we have our optimistic hats on, and even though short-term rates might come down. That's less of an impact on us than kind of the mid-term rate. So if the 3s, 5s and 7s move up a little bit as a result of hopefully continued economic activity in a more positive outlook about the future and about inflation, we could get some recovery there. But as it stands today, I think we were very clear that we have about a $30 million delta for '20 versus Investor Day. And if it's $30 million for '20, I can guarantee you it's a bigger number and for '21 and I think the math is relatively very poor. Kathleen Winters : I think if you just assume the same forward curve that we see today, if you assume that you'd be in about the same level of client fund interest in '21 as we're expecting in '20. Tien- tsin Huang : Yes. Carlos Rodriguez : Yes, like I said, we have a lot of stuff, we are a lot of stuff cooking. So we're not a -- we've learned to be agile, we've learned to be a debt and we will adjust to the environment, if necessary. And just as a point of reference in terms of being able to adjust I'll just point out that I took some notes here last night that we went in the pre-crisis our yield, our average yield on client funds was 4.5% on approximately I think it was $15 billion to $16 billion in balances. And the yield on our client funds when all the way down to 1.7% before now getting back to 2.2%. And so, if we were able to grow through an improved margins and improved profit going from 4.5% yield to 1.7%, I think will be okay. Because the good news is from 2.2% to 0 is less than 4.5% to 1.7%. So even if we go to zero, ADP will continue to chug along. We'll continue to grow and will continue to find ways to generate margin. Tien- tsin Huang : Yes, I know you're thoughtful about what you can control. So just really, really quick, I promise. Just on the PEO side, I know a lot of questions. We've seen a couple of assets trade Carlos in the last year. So I'm curious if that changed your thinking on maybe one just scale up in PEO. Carlos Rodriguez : I'm sorry. Say one more time. Tien- tsin Huang : Yes. We've seen a couple of acquisitions, right, take place on the PEO front here in the last nine months or so. If I'm counting right, just curious did that changes your thinking I want to maybe do deal on it. Carlos Rodriguez : I misunderstood. I heard trading and I thought I you were referring to something. Tien- tsin Huang : Yes, I -- which is my [indiscernible]. Carlos Rodriguez : That's alright, that's alright. I think we have the same I think position that we've had all along, which is -- we have capital we after paying dividends and after a modest share buybacks, we have excess capital and we would love to deploy it. And I think we love the PEO business, but again, at the risk of a broken record, we're highly disciplined and sensitive about price, which matters in terms of what you pay in terms of valuation. But in the PEO business, there is another dimension of discipline around the quality of the business that you're buying, because again, most of our competitors take more risk than we do and that creates the potential for more volatility in their business. And so whether or not these assets that are trading that's fully contemplated or recognized only history we'll tell, but we understand this business fairly well and we are -- I guess, I will leave it at that. I think we just careful about it I'm sure that that's factored into any kind of due diligence, and it is what it. So we are where we are. But we would love to find an opportunity to grow our PEO business inorganically if the opportunity were to arise. Tien- tsin Huang : Got it. Congrats on a good clean results guys. Thanks. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for his closing remarks. Carlos Rodriguez : So I want to thank everybody for joining us today. We obviously had a strong year you could hear our optimism and hopefully it came through. We have a lot of stuff going on. We executed on our voluntary early retirement program. We're very excited. It didn't come up in the call. But our new brand platform, I think is, is important, it's something that is new to us as a company and I think, we think that could incrementally help our sales force and make them more productive. And we talked a little bit about all that we have going on with our next generation solutions, which I think should power ADP for the next three, five, 10 years and hopefully more years to come with these global platforms.And last thing I'll say is, for those you who are not aware, we actually reached our 70th birthday this year as a company. And it's not every company that survive that long. And I thought it was just a second to reflect on what is it about ADP, that has allowed it to make it through so many technology changes through so many economic cycles. And I'd say that the one thing that I keep coming back to is the commitment of our organization to focus on our clients and to deliver value to them and to deliver service. I think is probably the thing that all of my predecessors would say, and I would reiterate, is the key to our success and we've done that by staying focused on our associates, by staying focused on what they need by listening to them and supporting them and they then deliver the outstanding products and the outstanding service that we deliver to our clients. We then stick around with us and deliver great returns for our shareholders.And so it's been a great run for seven years for our Company, I think all of our associates who, today, continue to carry the torch and continue to execute and work hard on our strategy to take us forward. We remain incredibly optimistic and positive about the future and we really appreciate your support and your interest in ADP. Thanks again for joining us and appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : And with that ladies and gentlemen we conclude the call. You may now disconnect. Good day, everyone.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP\u2019s First Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Christian Greyenbuhl, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Christian Greyenbuhl : Thank you, Crystal. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining ADP\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call and webcast. With me today are Carlos Rodriguez, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathleen Winters, our Chief Financial Officer.Earlier this morning, we released our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The earnings materials are available on the SEC\u2019s website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today\u2019s call as well as our quarterly history of revenue and pre-tax earnings by reportable segment.During our call today, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description and the timing of these items along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measure can be found in our earnings release.Today\u2019s call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, as such, involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.Before turning the call over to Carlos, you would have noticed in today\u2019s earnings that we made a correction this quarter to certain PEOs zero margin pass-through revenues that we have previously reported on a gross basis and which going forward will be reported on a net basis.For consistency, we also revise prior periods and the total impact to fiscal 2019 revenues and operating expenses was $65 million. This does not materially impact our previously reported growth rates and does not impact consolidated earnings before income taxes, net earnings, consolidated financial condition or cash flows. To better assist you, we have also included the details of these adjustments in the appendix to the presentation that accompanies today\u2019s call. Our supplemental schedule of quarterly history of revenue and pre-tax earnings by reportable segments also reflects the impacts of these changes.Accordingly, our reported results and full year outlook and the following commentary from both Carlos and Kathleen also fully reflect the impact of these adjustments. As always, please do not hesitate to reach out should you have any questions.And with that, let me turn the call over to Carlos. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you, Christian. And thank you everyone for joining our call. This morning we reported our first quarter fiscal 2020 results with revenue of $3.5 billion for the quarter, up 6% reported and organic constant currency. We are pleased with this revenue growth, which despite some higher than expected unfavorability in FX was in line with our expectations.Our efforts to enhance our operating efficiency along with your focus retention on transformation help us deliver 60 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion for this quarter. This margin expansion was in line with our expectations and we are happy to see the progress that our associates continue to make in helping to improve our productivity, while also improving client satisfaction, particularly given the difficult margin compare given our strong performance in the first half of fiscal 2019.Together with share buybacks and a slightly lower than expected adjusted effective tax rate these results help us deliver 12% adjusted EPS growth this quarter, which was slightly ahead of our expectations.Moving on to Employer Services new business bookings, this quarter we saw solid growth across our US markets, which helped drive 6% growth in the quarter. With regard to our international and multinational sales opportunities, we did see some impact from timing as certain deals that were expected to close this quarter are now expected to close slightly later in the fiscal year. Nevertheless, we are maintaining our full year Employer Services new business bookings guidance of 6% to 8%.Now turning to Client Service. We continue to drive improvements in our client satisfaction scores across our businesses. And this quarter, we were especially pleased with our progress in the upmarket with improvements in both our implementation and overall client satisfaction scores.We continue to take positive steps to transform our service organization and enhance the client experience, and with this continued progress in mind, we remain confident in our forecasted full year fiscal 2020 retention increase of 10 basis points to 20 basis points.We are pleased with our start to fiscal 2020 and with the continued momentum in advancing our strategy to simplify how we do business, deliver innovative solutions for our clients and associates and drive sustainable long-term growth for our shareholders.We understand that a key element of building our success in the market is in the capacity to be agile and to anticipate and adopt to change. Innovation is at the core of this need and it\u2019s a job that's never done. While we are incredibly excited about the solutions, we are delivering in the market today to help clients meet the needs of an evolving workforce, we're even more excited about the future. As the workforce continues to evolve, organizations are looking for ways to manage their entire workforce through a single user experience.Today companies of all sizes are using a variety of applications to get work done. What they need is an open HCM platform that allows easy integration with third-party solutions and is also flexible enough to handle the increasingly dynamic nature of work, one where workers are organized around how work happens in teams, often with individuals working on multiple teams at the same time. Aided by insights from the ADP Research Institute, our Next Gen HCM platform is designed at the core to address these needs.A few weeks ago I had the opportunity to attend the HR Technology conference in Las Vegas where our Next Gen HCM platform and used innovations took center stage. As I met with clients and HR professionals, I was incredibly proud of the reception and recognition that we received for delivering innovative solutions that address how and where work is done today.I was especially proud when our Next Gen HCM platform won both the HR Executive Top HR Product of the year award and the Awesome New Technology award, a remarkable achievement and a testament to ADP's commitment to innovation.Back in September, we also had the opportunity to showcase some of the differentiating features of ADP's Next Gen platform to HCM industry analysts when we hosted our 2019 Industry Analyst Day. At this event, we spent time sharing some of the more meaningful and differentiating elements of our technology, such as, the use of graph database technology that powers the unique ability to dynamically configure teams while enabling actionable data and insights around relationships or our meta data driven design approach that allows solutions to be tailored by the client via local rapid development through a drag-and-drop interface.In addition, our solution was designed from the beginning to be public cloud native. This among other advantages helps improve resiliency and uptime.Finally, our solution is designed to be global. Companies that are expanding globally, or that would like to more effectively manage their existing global workforce are an ideal target for ADP Next Gen HCM.We were equally proud and excited to see, the recognition our efforts from industry experts, at this event. And while it is great to receive these awards and to recognized by industry experts.It is even more rewarding when we see our efforts translate into recognition and acknowledgment from our clients and prospects. As we work to scale our solution and its capabilities, our Next Gen platform is also building momentum in the market and continues to progress in line with our expectations.As an example, earlier this quarter, at our Industry Analyst Day, we shared details of a successful go live with a 6,000 employee U.S. company that chose ADP's Next Gen HCM platform for its talent capabilities. And the ease of the ease of integration with the client's own internally developed on-boarding tool.At the same events, we were also pleased to share that we have recently signed a 65,000-employee global enterprise that was looking for an HCM platform, capable of handling its growing workforce.With that said, our focus on innovation is not limited to our Next Gen HCM platform. We have also increasing the leverage, machine learning to enhance our core strategic advantages in payroll and big data. As an example, we simplified 21 million raw job titles from our unmatched data like, and normalized them down to 2,400 job categories, ultimately enhancing both this functionality and accuracy of our ADP data cloud benchmarking.Customers are using our compensation and HR benchmark data to make substantial changes to their business. For example, one of our clients was able to leverage our turn over benchmark data, to identify opportunities for improvement, and ultimately to reduce their turnover by 20%.While another saw its front line managers use our Executive and Manager Insight\u2019s mobile solution, to help reduce overtime cost by 6%. These equate to real multimillion dollar operational savings that are being enabled by ADP's data and products.Also to enhance the efficiency of our implementation organization, we are designing our NEXT GEN payroll engine to automatically recognize, convert and classify different formats, an input, from prior payrolls and so payroll policies.We believe that this will give us an advantage when we on board new clients, because it will enable the automation of various elements of the implementation process. And allow us to share best practices with our clients.And finally, we also continue to drive innovation for our frontline associates, in an effort to transform how we work, by reducing low value, client contacts, while still delivering value-added service.With this in mind, last year, our support organization and the downmarket rolled out expanded checkbox functionality, which today is capable of handling over 100 different inquiry types for our more than 640,000 small business clients.ADP's unique ability to meet the needs of clients and their workers today while anticipating their needs in the future, have been hallmarks of our success over the past 70 years. And I believe will driver sustained growth in the years to come.And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kathleen, for commentary on our results and fiscal 2020 outlook. Kathleen Winters : Thank you, Carlos. And good morning, everyone. As Carlos mentioned, we're pleased in transforming our business, in order to simplify, innovate and grow. Our strategy is working, and we are off to a solid start to the year.This morning, we reported first quarter revenue growth in line with our expectation, at 6% on a reported and organic constant currency basis, which includes a slightly greater amount of FX unfavorability than we previously anticipated.Our adjusted EBIT increased 8%, also in line with expectations. And adjusted EBIT margin was up 60 basis points compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We're pleased with this margin improvement, which benefited from cost savings related to our workforce optimization and procurement transformation initiative as well as continued efficiencies within our IT infrastructure.These benefits were partially offset by incremental brand spend as well as selling, amortization and PEO pass-through expenses. This margin performance is particularly gratifying given the difficult margin compare that we faced in the first half of the year.As a reminder, this resulted from the very strong performance in the first half of fiscal 2019, resulting from the outside benefits related to our voluntary early-retirement program due to slower than anticipated plan to backfill at that time.Our adjusted effective tax rate decreased by 100 basis points to 21.2% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The decrease was mainly due to an increase in tax incentives related to lower R&D efforts and decreasing reserves from certain tax positions.Adjusted diluted earnings per share were 12% to $1.34. And in addition to benefiting to our benefiting to our revenue growth, margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate was also aided by fewer shares outstanding compared to a year ago.Let\u2019s move now to our Employer Services segment and interest in funds held for client. Employer Services revenues were in line with expectations and grew 4% reported and 5% organic constant currency.Interest income on client funds grew 13% and benefited from a 10 basis point improvement in the average yield earned on our client fund investments to 2.3% and growth in average client fund balances of 7% to $23.7 billion.This growth in balances was driven by a combination of client growth, wage inflation and growth in our pays per control partially offset by lower SUI collections. Our Employer Services same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.4% for the first quarter.Employer Services margins saw an increase of 50 basis points from the quarter. The increase in margins this quarter which enabled by the same factors I mentioned earlier when discussing our consolidated results.Our PEO segment revenues grew 8% for the quarter to $1.1 billion with average worksite employees growing 7% to 563,000. Revenues excluding zero margin benefits pass through grew 7% to $358 million and continued to include pressure from lower workers' compensation and SUI costs and related pricing.Margins decreased about 70 basis points for the quarter largely due to changes in ADP Indemnity loss reserve estimates, which drove about 60 basis points of pressure resulting from a smaller benefit in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019.As a reminder, with ADP Indemnity results not reported in the PEO, it is normal to expect some volatility in our quarterly PEO margins as a result of changes in our workers' compensation loss reserves.Let's turn to the outlook for the full year and start with a consolidated view. We continued to anticipate total revenue growth of 6% to 7% in fiscal 2020. This revenue outlook assumes a more elevated level of FX on favorability for the remainder of fiscal 2020 relative to our previous expectations.With the recent volatility and overlying fixed interest rates, we now assume interest income on client funds of $570 million to $580 million and interest income from our extended investment strategy is now expected to be $575 million to $585 million.With the continued negative interest rate environment in the Eurozone, we made the decision this quarter to wind down our two Eurozone related client money moving activities in France and the Netherlands.As a result, we have liquidated our Dutch client funds portfolio and we will be liquidating our French client portfolio by the end of fiscal year 2020. We therefore now anticipate our growth and average client funds balances to be about 4%, as compared to our previous forecast of 4% to 5%. This decision is excusive to France and the Netherlands.We continue to anticipate our adjusted EBIT margin to expand basis points 100 basis points to 125 basis points. And we now anticipate our adjusted effective tax rate to be 23.3%. The rate includes this quarter's unplanned tax benefit from stock-based compensation related to stock option exercises.It does not however include any further estimated tax benefit related to potential future stock option exercises given the dependency of that benefit on the timing of those exercises. With these slight adjustments to our outlook, we continue to expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to grow 12% to 14% in fiscal 2020.Moving on to the segments, let's take a look at Employer Services. We continue to expect 4% to 5% revenue growth in our Employer Services segment. This outlook includes the anticipated impact from my previous remarks regarding changes in FX and adjustments to our interest income on client funds outlook. We continue to anticipate pays per control growth of about 2.5%.We also continue to expect Employer Services new business bookings growth of 6% to 8% and for our Employer Services revenue retention to improve 10 basis points to 20 basis points. I'd like to remind you as I commented in the prior earnings call that there is volatility inherent in the quarterly Employer Services bookings metric from larger international and upmarket deals.And I\u2019d also like to remind you the difficult compare in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 resulting from our strong performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 due in part to a client list acquisition.Moving onto margins. We continue to expect our margin in the Employer Services segment to expand by 100 basis points to 125 basis points. As a reminder with a difficult compare resulting from our strong margin performance in the first half of fiscal 2019, we continue to expect a much stronger margin increase in the latter half of fiscal 2020.Regarding our PEO segment, overall, our outlook remains unchanged. We continue to expect 9% to 11% PEO revenue growth in fiscal 2020 and 7% to 9% growth in PEO revenues excluding zero margin benefit pass-throughs, both driven by an anticipated growth of 7% to 9% in average worksite employees.Because of the slower growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we continue to expect the growth in our average worksite employees to be at the lower end of our guidance range in the first half of the year with a gradual reacceleration of our growth rate as the year progresses.As we also discussed last quarter, we continue to expect lower workers' compensation and SUI cost and related pricing to pressure our total PEO revenue growth. For PEO margin, we continue to anticipate margins to be flat to down 25 basis points in fiscal 2020, which continues to include approximately 50 basis points of pressure from smaller favorable reserve adjustments in ADP Indemnity in fiscal 2020, compared to fiscal 2019.Before I hand the call over for Q&A, I'd like to share that on February 11, we will be hosting an Innovation Day, focused on technology, strategy and showcasing some of her latest innovations.A few of you have had the opportunity to see some of those developments during HR Tech. Others may have had a glimpse from some of the industry analyst notes, and tweets following our September Industry Analyst Day.The February 11th event would be specifically for the investment community, to share our product and service innovation, and have a dialogue around the progress that we continue to make, including how these innovations help to differentiate ADP in the market.We look forward to welcoming you then, and please be on the lookout, for further details in the near future.With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. This is Damien on for Ramsey. I wanted to ask on the Employer Services bookings guidance. I know you both talked about it at lengths. But I just wanted to see if you could give anymore color on just the quarterly cadence.I know Kathleen you mentioned difficult comps coming up in Q4. But maybe just any granularity that you could give would be great. And then, just overall level of confidence to kind of get to the midpoint of that 6% to 8% guidance? Carlos Rodriguez : I'll let maybe Kathleen make a comment as well. But again, I think if you that last year's pattern, our second quarter last year was soft. So that would be the easier compare. And the fourth quarter because of the acquisition of the client base acquisition from Wells Fargo, I think, it'll be a little more difficult.But we obviously try to apply some judgment on these things. And we obviously have information about individual unit performance and kind of what's happening across regions.And I think what we try to provide in some of the color our comments is that this quarter we had very strong, what I would call strong results in our core US businesses, SBS, major accounts and national accounts. And we really had some weakness with international and multinational. And we\u2019ll look into the details of that. There were a few large deals in prior year, as well as some deals that didn't close in the first quarter as expected. So that would give us some confidence that I think, we\u2019re still on track for the year, despite these kind of quarterly fluctuations.Because I think as Kathleen's said, and we said many times for us bookings is certainly more volatile than revenues. Obviously, we have the recurring revenue model. But on bookings the clock goes back to zero at the beginning of every quarter.But we see some underlying strength that gives us some optimism. But we did have some weakness in the international multinational and that is something that we\u2019re looking at. I don't think that it's any major change in the economy, because it\u2019s been kind of a difficult in the economic climate for a while in Europe where we have a large business. So, again as I look at the detail, it just looks like, typical lumpiness in our bookings. Kathleen Winters : Yeah. I mean just to follow-up on with that. Look you\u2019re always going to have some degree of lumpiness in your quarterly bookings number right, from at least a couple of things, right?If you\u2019ve got larger multinational type deals, that's going to cost some lumpiness. And then you\u2019ve got the year-over-year comps issue and you\u2019ve got a tough comp or an easier comp. So you\u2019ll always have a little bit of that going on. And so importantly, while the quarterly numbers obviously important I think even more important to look at a longer term trend, right?When you look at how we've been doing in particular with last year having a really strong and I think record, right, number of $1.6 billion for last year and then 8%. And then on top of that another what we think is a really solid number of 6% in Q1, when you look at that longer period of time, we\u2019re actually feeling pretty pleased with the start to the year.Now there is of course always pockets that are stronger and others that are maybe a little slower out of the gate and Carlos mentioned on the outside of the US having a little bit of lumpiness there, but net-net we're pretty pleased with the start to the year. Unidentified Analyst : Yeah. That makes sense, and great. Then maybe I\u2019ll zoom out a little bit and ask on overall sort of product strategy at the large enterprise level. I just wanted to dig in and see how you see your products suite revolving there just sort of in the context of you continuing to invest advantage over time and then your strategy - your new strategy around the Lifion offering. Carlos Rodriguez : Don't forget we also again one of the highlights for the quarter and frankly it's been a highlight in trying to kind of signal this. I am not sure how it has landed yet, but our decision to use Workforce Now with the lower end of the upmarket, so call it that 1,000 to 3,000 even though frankly it can go higher. We have a couple of clients that have 8, 9,000 employees that are on Workforce Now. But that decision has been great competitively in growth wise. So we are selling a lot of units in that kind of lower end of the upmarket.So the ability to use Workforce Now for - and it fits certain types of profiles clients and you can probably imagine generally speaking they are large, but simpler and Vantage clients would be more complex and have more complex needs like complex benefits and talent requirements and so forth.And Lifion it\u2019s still obviously an early adopter type of product, even though we're getting great traction and we told you what - how we've done in terms of new sales given the size of ADP, it\u2019s really Workforce Now and Vantage Now that are affecting the numbers in terms of the bookings and the revenue. And I think again in case I wasn't clear like that we had a good quarter even in national accounts in the upmarket primarily as a result of really good results from Workforce Now.So the strategy is the same strategy we\u2019ve had all along, which is I think we\u2019ve figured out that we have a really great solution for a segment of the market. I think last quarter, I mentioned that we have an external third-party do some analysis for us and in terms of segmenting the market, and as usual one solution doesn't fit the entire market. And what we found was that a pretty good size percentage of the market can be addressed by our Workforce Now solutions and that's what we're doing.And we were right. And the analysis was right. And we think the Vantage still addresses another segment of the market and Lifion is more kind of the emerging solution that we obviously have placed a lot of confidence and a lot of a - and a big bet on for the future. But as of today it's really not having a big impact on the numbers.And I also just in terms of just your question about market dynamic when we had this meeting in Las Vegas at the HR Tech Conference that I mentioned in my comments again, early positive signs we had for anyone who was there, I think some of our \u2013 some industry analysts and some financial analysts were there, I think, it was pretty clear that we are making an impact in the market. So our lead flow was multiples of what it has been in the past in the upmarket because of the interest in Lifion.But I just want to be cautious in terms of pace here because relative to our $15 billion in revenue, this is not next quarter or three quarters from now. But the signs are very, very positive in the long-term as Kathleen mentioned. If you focus on the long-term, I think, Lifion - the traction we're getting in Lifion is very, very encouraging. Unidentified Analyst : Yeah. That's, that's really good. We'll keep watching. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thank you. Hey, you\u2019re able to reaffirm the revenue despite the lower client interest on kind of funds and extended investment. Was there any kind of offset there particularly given the incremental headwinds and FX? It seems like you're able to reaffirm the guide despite those couple of headwinds. Carlos Rodriguez : You know, I think, it goes back to what we're saying about the some of the underlying performance of the business. So as an example, even though we don't give quarterly guidance on retention, you could tell from our comments, I hope that we felt pretty good about it this quarter, so that you could probably read into that it improved prior to - compared to last year's prior first quarter.And as I mentioned before retention if you do the math has a pretty outside impact on our business bookings in terms of revenue and frankly big impact on margin because for equal growth you don't have to implement as much business.And so there's a lot of different moving parts that go into the pot here, but I would point that one out as an area of strength. I think we've talked about the strong performance in our core U.S. businesses.So for the first quarter we had kind of our three core businesses performing very well in terms of bookings as well. So it's a process from the ground up of us building this forecast, first of plan and now the forecast and I think we have some optimism that we're still in that range.And but I just want to point out the retention story because three or four years ago when it was going the other way, I pointed out that it takes four to five points of sales growth of new business bookings growth to offset one point of retention just because of the way the math works. And so - now as retention - as you get a little bit of improvement in retention that helps a lot in terms of our growth rate. Kathleen Winters : Yes. So as Carlos mentioned there's a couple of things that obviously gave us some headwind or unfavorably versus what we would have been expecting particularly the FX and the interest from client funds. However, when you look at operationally the fundamentals things look really good.As Carlos said retention is on a steady track upwards now gets harder and harder the higher up you go. But we're happy to see some level of increase in the first quarter here, and bookings were solid for the quarter. Carlos Rodriguez : And I would just add on the client funds interest, we do have some of this - for the year it obviously has an impact as we guided - we gave you the information in terms of we are slightly below what we expected to be, but it's not a huge number for this fiscal year. Kevin McVeigh : Great. And then just Carlos to highlight the retention a little bit more because obviously really nice progress there. Any sense of just the success across the enterprise versus the mid-market versus kind of downstream a little bit the range on those? Carlos Rodriguez : Yes. I do have some sense. My sense is that, we're improving a lot. So we show some signs in terms of the win-loss, what we call balance of the trade, some encouraging signs particularly in our mid-market business.So again the mid-market now is performing - you got to be cautious because there's definitely a forward-looking statement. But it's performing according to the script, in the sense if you remember we took a lot of pain and lot of effort to migrate all of our clients on to one single strategic platform which is Workforce Now.And when you look at the history of what happened in our SBS downmarket business. When we did that, we were optimistic and hopeful that we would have the same kind of traction in our mid-market business. And it's beginning to show now.So we have improving retention now for it feels like six or seven quarters somewhere in that range. I am being told more. So once we kind of finish the migration and got through that difficulty. I think we have steady improvements in retention.This quarter was the second highest retention we've ever had, in our mid-market business. And in this quarter what was very encouraging is to see the level of activity in new business bookings. So, the combination of those two things gives us a feeling of optimism for what is - one of biggest and more profitable businesses. Kevin McVeigh : Awesome, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning. Could you comment on, the drivers that you expect to move your PEO revenue growth up from 8% in the recent quarter to 9% to 11% which is your guide for this year?And then, just as a follow-up at your Analyst Day last year you gave a multiyear guide of 12% to 14%, CAGR for your HRO business, and you're trending well below that now. Did you anticipate the time that the growth rates in the earlier year\u2019s double-digits effectively, would slow towards the end of that period? Let's say, mid- to high single digits? Carlos Rodriguez : Well if I can start with the second one first, since I was there in the analysts and not fair to ask Kathleen. I think we have built the guidance for or I guess the estimates for are three years. We had as I think we've mentioned this couple of times, we had certain expectations around our pass through revenue and inflation of those numbers that had some historical precedent, both around workers compensation and health care.And I think literally within two months of that, the picture changed, and we communicated that very clearly and very transparently and frankly, without any anxiety because it doesn't have any impact in our EPS. So if you remember the Investor Day, I think it June and I think when we had our August earnings call, I think, we brought down significantly for that year at least, the growth rate for the PEO mainly - primarily close to almost based on lower inflation.Now on top of that, we have had some slowdown in worksite employee growth, which is the core driver underneath of the real growth of the business. But I think a main driver of this differential from what we communicated at our Investor Day has been has been the lower inflation of the pass-through, which again doesn't concern us, in a big way because it\u2019s zero margin and doesn't really affect our profitability in terms of in terms of dollars.In terms of your question about the behavior of the quarters and so forth, probably beyond the scope of this call but, it's just kind of math in terms of when we have our open enrollment for healthcare in kind of May, June timeframe which we\u2019ve again communicated very transparently when that happens and what happens when that occurs, you tend to have some client churn.So that drops your worksite employee growth and obviously revenue growth for the PEO. And then as bookings continue to - assuming they continue to be robust, you start to build that up again. And then at the end of the calendar year-end, you have another event at year end where you have some churn in the client base in terms of clients that choose to leave at the end of the calendar year because that's more natural, but we also have historically a lot of bookings in January as well.So we've been doing this for 20 years and we see a difference or a change we would obviously communicate that. But I think we're just kind of dropping the numbers in as they are supposed to come in terms of -- based on historical trends.And David I would just add, so last quarter we did say that we would expect to start a year from the lower end of the range and then grow into the range as the year progresses because obviously, we started with a somewhat of a weaker ending worksite employee number in the fourth quarter last year. Christian Greyenbuhl : And I think it's probably worth asking I mean, adding just again in full transparency, I think we said it last quarter our health care renewal was slightly higher than the previous year. So I wouldn't - it wasn't anything out of norm in terms of historical, but it was higher than the previous yearAnd when that - when we have that happen you tend to get more shoppers and more -- health care cause is a large part of what a small business pays in their overall cost structure of their workforce. And so they tend to shop and look around and so forth, and so we have a little bit more churn than I think that we have had in the prior year.The good news is for us is that we have that issue, but we've been dealing with that for 20 years, but we don\u2019t think any risk on health care. So whatever we get in terms of price increases through the carriers, we pass those through 100% which is why we call zero margin pass-through.So that eliminates any risk or any surprises in the future, but it also means that you have to have frankly the courage to just pass those costs through and let the chips fall where they may.And the chips fell and I think you can see from the numbers that the chips didn't fall off the table, because there wasn't a collapse in the because of a huge slowdown, but we definitely had our speed bump and now it's really through new business bookings that we have to regain the momentum and kind of have that ramp up again and reacceleration of the growth rate. David Togut : Understood. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin from Cowen. Your line is open. Bryan Bergin : Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Carlos, wanted to ask your macro outlook on the current employment market. It sounds encouraging based on the performance of the business, but I'm curious how much of that is due to the improved competitive product position versus the underlying demand you might be saying? Carlos Rodriguez : It's a great question because it's an important one for us to keep kind of asking ourselves, we do have some things that you know if they turn on us would put pressure on us, interest rates obviously is one of them, pays per control, et cetera.But we're also feeling pretty good about our product situation and I think our competitive situation in the marketplace going forward here. So it is -- that's going to be a very important question for us to stay focused on here for the next few quartersBut as of today, when you look at our lagging indicators so pays per control, it doesn't look like there's a slow down or a big issue, but if you look at the same things that everyone else would look at that we have access to and you have access to in terms of leading indicators like confidence indexes or NFIB/ISM - those types of things Michigan confidence.You know those, there\u2019s some concern there and some reason for caution. In our numbers, the only place where we have seen some little bit of softness and pace for control and it doesn't get reflected in our and what we report because as we've disclosed prior this is our Autopay base which is a very large base of both large employers, midsize employers and smaller employers.But we have most of our employer in our run platform and there we've seen a slight down tick in pays per control growth over the prior year. It doesn't - when you look at over the 10-year history, I don't think it's anything to be alarmed by, but - when you look at other factors it certainly a cause for caution. I just happened to look I think, in the last couple of days at NFIB and that's softened significantly, but it's still well above recession levels.And so I think we\u2019re all kind of trying to figure out the same thing here which is a soft patch or is it kind of a trend line. But with - the Fed easing and the consumer still strong like right now our plans are that we kind of work our way through this soft patch. Bryan Bergin : Okay. That's helpful. And then Kathleen on just margin expansion progress, any further details you can share on the various transformation initiatives? And as you look across the various resources were you seeing the most yield, and anything surprising you as you've had just more time in the seat? Kathleen Winters : Yes. Thanks for the question. Obviously, something that I'm really focused on in the organization is really very focused on as well. I mean just to kind of get some context and kind of big picture when you step back and take a look at what we've done in the last couple of years.I mean remember back in 2018, we were at margin rate of 20.7%, with a small amount of margin expansion in that year and then in 2019 when -- fiscal 2019, when we were executing on some really big and meaningful transformation initiatives.You saw that really outsized margin expansion of 160 basis points, and know -- as a reminder the guide for another 100 basis points to 125 basis points for fiscal 2020.So a track record here really consistent margin expansion. And as we start in fiscal 2020 with Q1 that 60 basis points of margin expansion we're really happy to see that and very happy that we're on track with how we planned the year.Now there's a lot of execution and a lot of work behind the scenes going on but I'd point out that number one as I started my comment there's a lot of energy around it and a lot of alignment. And that energy and alignment is around both executing what I call in-flight projects as well as developing the pipeline for the future. So that's really exciting.I talked about on the previous call that most of the margin expansion from a transformation perspective this year is coming from what we're calling workforce optimization and procurement initiatives both are very much on track from a workforce optimization standpoint.Think about that in terms of spans and layers exercise if you will and particularly targeted to management layers. So that's kind of on track and already executed with most of that benefit being in fiscal 2020 not much from that coming beyond fiscal 2020.And then procurement transformation there's a lot of projects there as we look at - across all parts of the organization and spend as we look at volume and we look at policy and we look at our ability to negotiate smartly with vendors and suppliers. There is opportunity there and there is a lot of execution going on.So a lot of work execution going on. So, a lot of work by the organization, we're happy with what the teams are currently doing and happy with the progress, but more to do. Bryan Bergin : Thank you. Carlos Rodriguez : Hi, Brian. I just - one thing just to add, as you think about the margin because your question I think was related to margins in particular. And obviously what's driving those. But last year, the first and second quarter but particularly the second quarter was a very strong growth in margin in that time.And just a reminder, we also had pressure from M&A at that time. So, just layer that one on to it as well when you think about margin cadence last year versus this year. Bryan Bergin : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Grossman from Stifel. Your line is open. David Grossman : Thank you. Good morning. I wonder if I could just follow-up with a couple of questions on the PEO. Each of your kind of larger peers in that space have identified some type of incremental issue with their health insurance book in their most recent reports.And I know you mentioned, just higher health premiums and obviously you pass everything through in your model. But is there anything else, you're seeing in the market place that may be impacting the cost of delivering health insurance in the PEO industry? Carlos Rodriguez : No. David Grossman : All right. So for you, it's just the straight higher premium and not seeing anything else? I guess, you don't really see the claim that is around in terms of how claims may be impacting on a cost? Carlos Rodriguez : You will see individual employee, claims data but we of course very, very carefully looking at claims data to get some sense with our carriers and partnership with our carriers, what's happening in terms of trends.Maybe I should be a little bit more, clear on this, premium increase issue. So, I'm not going to give you the exact numbers. I don't think we want to get down that rabbit hole. But the change from this renewal to the prior renewal was call it one to two percentage points higher, on average than the prior year. So if, the previous year the average renewal increase was 6% then the next year it was it was it was 7% or 8%.And that increase that year that was slightly higher was completely in line with the prior six or seven years. So it wasn't -- so there are some ups and downs. But the prior year was one that was actually exceptional. I think we were very clear about that. I think we talked about that in our calls, that we had a really great renewal on our health care on average I remember this is not one carrier. These are multiple carriers.We use a number of different carriers to make sure we have good coverage across the entire country. And so, that was unusual. And it helped us competitively. But I think this renewal was not out of line with historical norms and has nothing to do with any of that.I think anything that's happening around health care this probably has to do with people's underwriting policies and their own approach to bringing in business and repricing business, because it's not just about the business you bring in.But every year if you're self-insured or you're taking risk, you have the opportunity or the option of passing through or not passing through health care costs. And you actually have some judgment with your underwriters on what those costs are.And so that's generally typically what could create a problem in health care. But it doesn't appear to us that there's really anything happening broadly in the health care industry around PEOs. David Grossman : And then just on your, just based on your commentary on workers comp. I mean I think the whole industry had a tailwind. So, if you look at this year's health increase plus the workers comp at a more normalized level, this is really a more typical year for you then right, I mean in terms of the PEO, in terms of those two items? Carlos Rodriguez : I think that's right. That's fair. And I think on the workers comp, just again to be clear was a -- I think we were clear, but why don\u2019t we say one more time, a smaller positive. So we're not having big surprises in terms of losses in workers comp or any kind of. And by the way we have very tight ship there in a sense that we have as we disclose in our 10-K, a collar that limits our risk in a fairly significant way. Caps are down side on workers comp. So we have reinsurance an individual claim and then we have a collar around overall loss estimates. So it's quite limited in terms of the volatility.I think the other thing that I would mention is that our business mix hasn't changed, so we look at that very carefully as well. So we looked at the mix of we call it white collar versus gray collar, but within those categories you have a lot of different industries and a lot of different categories of people and we don't see any major change there as well. David Grossman : Got it. And just as a follow-up, is kind of a bigger picture for you question Carlos is that given a relatively low penetration rates for the industry and that you get a lot of your new clients from a client that is already using you for payroll.What are the major objections to somebody enrolling in the PEO particularly if they're an ADP payroll customer and you already have the payroll records so it kind of disruption and transition cost time and effort are substantially lower? Carlos Rodriguez : I think it's - it goes back to like my first year marketing class in graduate school, which is high involvement decision, right. So the PEO to go to a small midsize business and tell them that you're going to create a co-employment relationship, you're taking over there healthcare plan, there\u2019s workers' compensation remember all along the way there are as an example that could be a relationship with insurance agent or a broker that's been providing to health care in the workers comp for the last 10 years that gets this intermediated.You have to - payroll is hard enough to convince some of the payroll because people worry about \u2013 are you sure you are not going to make a mistake and make sure that it's going to go accurately, we obviously have an incredibly strong reputation on payroll that helps us.But the traditional business is you\u2019re trying to convince someone to give you your payroll, now you're also trying to convince them to give you everything around their HR department.And so it's with a higher level of trust and it's again what I remember being taught is called a high involvement decision, which takes longer to make and is more difficult to make.So I honestly don't think that there is really anything that prevents clients from becoming PEO clients. And I think we've demonstrated over 20 years that we've convinced a lot of them.And so our board asks the same question you're asking, which can't you convince even more. And we're trying. Like, we continue to add improvements in the product. We continue to provide better tools. We continue to enhance our product. We continue to do all the things we can to make it more compelling and easier to use.As an example, I think we've kind of talked about this in the last 18 months, all new business now and the PEO starting in our Workforce Now platform which has higher functionality and provides the ability to satisfy slightly larger clients than we could before because it's a mid-market platform.And so there is a lot of things that we're doing to try to convince as many clients to come over to our PEO solution as possible. I think it's good for them and it's good for them and it's good for us but there's really nothing that I can point to other than kind of the difficulties of the convincing of the sale. David Grossman : I got it. Very helpful. Thank you for that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Your line is open. Jason Kupferberg : Hey. Good morning, guys. I just wanted to pick-up on some of the margin commentary. I mean, as you rightfully pointed out the comparison there gets quite a bit harder actually in the second quarter. So just so that our expectations are properly calibrated. I mean do you expect margins to be up in the second quarter year-over-year? Kathleen Winters : Yes. It's a really tough comp in Q2. Remember last fiscal year Q2, we had over 300 basis points of margin expansion. So it was going to be tough to expand in Q2. Maybe it's flat to slightly up slightly down. You know, hard to say exactly because there's so many moving parts.But the way I would think about is that the bulk of the expansion to come this fiscal year will come in the second half of the year. Jason Kupferberg : Yes. Okay. That's fair. I mean just on the bookings front somewhat similar question except in reverse right? Because you\u2019ve got the easy comp there in the second quarter. So do you need to be above the full year guidance range in the second quarter just to make sure that you stay on track to achieve the full year outlook? Because then obviously the comparisons here get a bit harder in the second half? Kathleen Winters : Above the bookings guidance number in the second quarter? Jason Kupferberg : You need to be above the full year range in Q2 just to keep yourself on track? Kathleen Winters : Mathematically, yes. So you're absolutely right. I mean it\u2019s to stay on that for the full year you\u2019ll have more growth in the second quarter and then much less in Q4. Jason Kupferberg : Right, right okay. And then just last quick one from me. What would be the drivers of the anticipated acceleration in the WSE growth during the balance of fiscal 2020? Carlos Rodriguez : Selling more new clients than losing clients. It really goes back to the - I mean, I hate to I'm not trying to be a smart [indiscernible] but the it's really the pattern, I think, I talked about it a couple of questions ago that when we tell our open enrollment in May and June, we tend to experience some client turn. The sales don't accelerate necessarily at the same necessarily at the same time.And so you have seen that phenomenon happens sometimes at the end of the calendar year where you may lose a group of clients and then you bring on new clients at the beginning of the year, but then you also bring on - so clients tend to not leave at other times of year other than calendar year end and open enrollment which is May and June.That doesn't mean non leave, I'm just saying that the skewing is cued towards those two periods. And the sales are skewed differently. And the combination of those two things is what causes either growth or deceleration in worksite employee growth. Kathleen Winters : Yes. Look on - any of the not any but like a lot of these metrics when you look at a very short period of time one quarter \u2013 you could have some one-off things happening. I saw - as I said earlier looking at these trends and a track record over time for things like bookings and worksite employee growth and even margin, right? Looking at the trend over time is helpful I find. Carlos Rodriguez : But again in this case we also have - we have to hit our plan, obviously. I guess as usual when we have these calls, if we are giving you the numbers based on what we expect right now. So if we hit our new business bookings plans and retentions stays when we expected to stay then you would get the outcomes that we're talking about.But as Kathleen said, there's a lot of moving parts if three to six months from now, the economies in the tank and pays per control is declining, it's going to in the PEO in addition to ES and it less than ADP and that would create a headwind. But in the absence of any new information I think, we feel pretty good about the forecast we have. Jason Kupferberg : Okay I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Wald from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Steven Wald : Hey, good morning. Just maybe a follow-up a on the margin expansion path, looking beyond, sort of the next few quarters or even this year, I just wanted to talk about the messaging. And make sure we were getting a proper sense of the drivers there.I think a lot of the talk has been around workforce optimization and procurement over the next 12 months or so. But I think, one of the things you guys try to talk about is the tech improvements or your investments.As you build more this into your platform, as you're add even more into what you are doing on a day-to-day basis. Can you talk a little bit about, how that scale to you're adding or that scalable expense base that you're adding will show up in terms of cost reductions or margin improvement? Carlos Rodriguez : Well, I think again back to like what Kathleen was talking about in terms of the math, some of it was really comparisons rather than anything that we're doing. And but we have to help people. We understand that it's important for you guys to understand that.So, just as a reminder last year what happened was, we had with the voluntary early retirement program, we had a good number of people taking that. And then the back fills that we had planned which was all planned, certain percentage of back fills were delayed.And so that impacted that year. We also got off to a very strong start for a couple of other reasons. We had other what we called quick wins at a time around transformation that help us get off to a strong start in the first half.And I think Kathleen talked about -- we had for us, like incredibly strong margin improvement. And so it's just a very difficult compare mathematically. As we've been going along, regardless of how the math works, we continue to work on a number of initiatives.And this year obviously we executed on this expand the layers initiative, and then we have a number of other projects around procurement is one of them but we also have a number kind of automation and digitization project that I think we're making some progress on. And when we have our industry - sorry our Analyst Day in February, we'll probably share a little bit more around some of those things that we're doing, because those are around transformation and innovation as well. So it's not just about innovating on the product side. But it's also innovating on the implementation and on the service side.And we\u2019ve gotten some good traction in some of our businesses which are allows our productivity to improve while, still for our associates. While still improving our NPS scores and our client satisfaction which by the way were up again this quarter and no surprise the retention is improving.It\u2019s usually a sign that client satisfaction is still high. So again trick here is you want to transform your cost structure, but you don't want to like lose all the clients in the meantime. And for now, we've been able to balance both of those and that's our plan here for the next year or two. Steven Wald : Yes. Fair enough. And then, maybe just one quick follow-up, I noticed the buy back a little bit higher than we\u2019ve seen last year or so. Just could you provide any commentary on how you're thinking about the pace there going forward? Kathleen Winters : Yes. So really no change in terms of how we're thinking about that. And our strategy we talked about the intent to buy back 1% of the share base. And we've been executing along those lines, so, really no change.We look all the time at the market conditions and look if there is some opportunity where there is a big downturn in the market and we want to become more active. Maybe we'll do that, I don't know. But constantly we watch that, we look at it, we talked about it all the time, but as of now no particular change. Carlos Rodriguez : Again, one little statistic, because we happen to notice these things when we prepare for these calls. Because now I get like seems like 20 years of information, so we\u2019ve reduced our share count by 30% since the early 2000\u2019s, and so we intend to continue to stay on that pace.And so obviously it's a marathon for a company like we're kind of proud that it's a marathon we've been around for seven years. And at 1% per year it adds up. And it certainly has added up in the last 20 years to the tune of a 30% share reduction.And I think that companies are in the different stage of development whether they're getting dilution and adding shares to their share count. We think we're going to win this marathon. Steven Wald : All right. Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our final question from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Bryan Keane : Hi, guys. Just a quick - two quick clarifications. On the PEO margins it was below street, but it didn't sound like it was really below your expectations. And it sounds like there was a tougher comp to the ADP Indemnity. So could maybe just talk to that and how that looks going forward on the margin side? Carlos Rodriguez : Yeah. No, I think that's a fair characterization. I think that as usual there\u2019s \u2013 and we try to obviously be as straight as we can be because sometimes there is a slight disconnect between what we\u2019re expecting versus since we don\u2019t give quarterly guidance. But the results I think were on that specific topic, I think we're in line with our expectations. Kathleen Winters : Yeah. It was definitely in line with how we expect to start the year. Bryan Keane : And then just the cadence how we think about that going forward on the margin for PEO? Carlos Rodriguez : That's a good question. I think that when you look at the annual guidance, I think it was down flat to 25 down\u2026 Kathleen Winters : Down 25 basis points. Carlos Rodriguez : Down to 25 basis points. I think that was the guidance. If you take our first quarter number, I would for now assume ratably margin improvement over the course of the rest of the year because these quarterly fluctuations in ADP Indemnity are not something that is - something that we can have a - we don't have any real visibility into that.And again, just as a reminder, part of why we've done this is, if you remember a couple of years ago, we had some criticism around our disclosures. So we had our client funds interest and Indemnity being handled in the kind of other category, which allowed us to not have these questions and not kind of makes up the results of those businesses.But as usual, there are two sides to every story. And so I think the criticism was those things really belong and the results of the business unit. Fair enough. So we made that change and now we are saddled with every quarter having to explain any kind of fluctuations here, because what really matters is the underlying health of the business.We don\u2019t take enough risk in that business for it to matter. But you can get because of the size of the business, if you get a $5 million fluctuation which is what we had this quarter up or down, it affects the numbers, but it doesn't really say anything about what's happening in the underlying business.But it is what it is. We now report Indemnity in the PEO and we\u2019re going to have to every quarter be able to give you that kind of color. And likewise in Employer Services we now have client funds interest. And so now that creates some variability in that business as well. Kathleen Winters : Yeah, so with the down - with the flat to down 25 basis points and down 70 in Q1 you'll see that just mathematically it ramps. But again it's going to depend on the ADP Indemnity and how that comes through during the balance of the year. Carlos Rodriguez : It was certainly easier when we didn't have ADP Indemnity in the PEO. But because nothing -- we've been doing that for 20 years. We've handled it. We\u2019re not by the way we are handling exactly the same way we\u2019ve always handled it. It\u2019s just a different accounting report. That's all. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude our question-and-answer portion for today. I'm pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for any closing remarks. Carlos Rodriguez : Well, thanks very much. You can tell we feel pretty good about the start to 2020. We're obviously trying to change a lot of things. We\u2019ve talked a lot about transformation. We'll share more with you when we have our Innovation Day here in February.But we\u2019re focused on execution as I think Kathleen alluded to this there's still a lot of execution in front of us. But we still - we try continue to be focused on our clients and our associates. And our associates are doing a phenomenal job as evidenced by our continuing improvements in our NPS scores.Obviously, we felt good about what happened with HR Tech, with our Lifion debut. So I think that gives us some optimism. We're very excited about what's happening in the mid-market business here in the first quarter.So I - continue to be very proud of our organization and the resiliency of the organization and the transformation efforts that they continue to execute on. So we look forward to giving you more updates in the time to come. And we thank you for joining our call today. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP\u2019s Second Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Christian Greyenbuhl, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Christian Greyenbuhl : Thank you, Crystal, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining ADP\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call and webcast. With me today are Carlos Rodriguez, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathleen Winters, our Chief Financial Officer.Earlier this morning, we released our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The earnings materials are available on the SEC\u2019s Web site and our Investor Relations Web site at investors.adp.com where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today\u2019s call as well as our quarterly history of revenue and pre-tax earnings by reportable segment.During our call today, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description and the timing of these items along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measure can be found in our earnings release.Today\u2019s call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, as such, involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.Before I turn the call over to Carlos, I\u2019d like to remind you of our upcoming Innovation Day which is scheduled for February 10. We hope to see many of you there in person and for those who are unable to attend, you can find more details about how to view the event at investors.adp.com. We\u2019re looking forward to sharing our progress on our investments and innovation as well as our vision for our HCM technology portfolio. As always, please do not hesitate to reach out should you have any questions.And with that, let me turn the call over to Carlos. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you, Christian, and thank you everyone for joining our call. This morning, we reported our second quarter fiscal 2020 results with revenue of 3.7 billion for the quarter, up 5% reported and organic constant currency. We are pleased with this revenue growth, which was slightly ahead of our expectations.Our adjusted EBIT margin increased 70 basis points for the quarter and was also slightly ahead of our expectations. Together with share buybacks and a lower adjusted effective tax rate, these results helped us deliver 13% adjusted EPS growth in this quarter. Overall, we are pleased with our progress through the first half of fiscal 2020 following a difficult compare with the first half of fiscal 2019.Moving on to operations and starting with new business bookings. This quarter, we continue to see strength in our Employer Services downmarket offerings and solid progress on the sales of our Workforce Now solutions. We were also particularly pleased to see strong double-digit bookings growth in our PEO.With that said, we are disappointed with our 3% Employer Services new business bookings growth for the quarter. This lower than expected growth was mainly the result of the same trends we saw in the first quarter with our international and multinational businesses, including delayed decisions for some of our larger multinational sales opportunities.As we have said before, given their size, these opportunities can have an outsized impact on our quarterly booking metric. With this in mind, we have narrowed our full year Employer Services new business bookings outlook and now expect 6% to 7% growth as compared to our previous guidance of 6% to 8% growth on last year\u2019s 1.6 billion of Employer Services new business bookings. We continue to have a solid pipeline of opportunities and we remain confident in our ability to execute across our portfolio.Looking at client service, we continue to see good progress with overall strength in our net promoter scores and retention. As a result, we continue to expect our forecasted full year fiscal 2020 Employer Services revenue retention to increase 10 to 20 basis points.Now we\u2019re halfway to fiscal 2020 and at the midpoint of our three-year targets we outlined at our June 2018 Investor Day. As we are also six months away from giving our fiscal 2021 guidance and we will not be giving any updated financial outlook at our upcoming Innovation Day, I want to take a few moments here to look back and share my thoughts on our progress since we provided that guidance.Let\u2019s start with new business bookings. You will recall that our June 2018 Investor Day, we outlined that we were targeting growth for worldwide new business bookings growth of 7% to 9% through 2021. Though we no longer regularly report a worldwide bookings figure, which as a reminder includes the results of Employer Services and PEO segments together, we thought it would helpful in that context of a midpoint look back to share that we have seen 8% average quarter growth since the beginning of fiscal 2019.We are pleased with this worldwide bookings growth together with our improvements in Employer Services revenue retention and how they demonstrate the strength and stability of our business even as we\u2019ve been going through meaningful transformation as an organization with a set of broad-based initiatives, including our Service Alignment Initiative in fiscal years 2017 and '18, our Voluntary Early Retirement Program in fiscal 2019 and most recently our Workforce Optimization and Procurement initiatives.Meanwhile, our quarterly average consolidated revenue grew 6% reported and organic constant currency over the past 18 months. As we look at some of the developments that have affected our recent growth relative to our expectations, we note that our PEO has not performed in line with our long-term expectations driven by lower than expected pass-through revenues and lower than planned worksite employee growth.Over the past several quarters, we have discussed some of the factors impacting PEO revenue growth, including the impacts from our sales incentives, recent retention unfavorability related to healthcare inflation and softness in workers\u2019 compensation and state unemployment insurance rates.With the impact of these factors, our average growth over the past 18 months in average worksite employees was 8% as compared to our long-term expectation of 9% to 11%. And a contribution to revenue growth from pass-throughs was 1% compared to our long-term expectation of 1% to 3%.Despite the slight underperformance relative to our expectations, we are confident in the overall prospects of the PEO business and continue to see healthy demand for our offerings. Our PEO platform is the leading fully outsourced solution in the HCM market and we combine this with best-in-class HR business partners, which together helps deliver an unparalleled service experience.Stepping back now to total revenue, we are tracking at 6% average growth through six quarters. We have a solid playbook with a proven track record of driving sustained growth and we\u2019ll continue to focus on delivering consistent strong bookings growth and retention performance as key priorities.And moving down the P&L, during this period we further solidified the foundations of our business as our associates continue to transform the way we work while also delivering innovative solutions to our clients.These transformation efforts along with our steady top line growth and the operating leverage in our model have helped deliver robust margin expansion and an average adjusted EBIT growth of 13% through the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2020, which is within the range of our fiscal 2021 target CAGR of 12.5% to 15.5%.This together with our disciplined share buybacks and a lower adjusted effective tax rate has driven adjusted EPS growth of 18%, which is tracking ahead of our targeted growth of 14.5% to 17.5% through fiscal 2021.As you can tell from our guidance for fiscal 2020, we currently anticipate ending the year within our fiscal 2021 three-year margin target range, one year ahead of schedule. This is no small accomplishment given our ongoing efforts to invest in the business for the long-term.Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with our progress to date. The journey that we have embarked upon to simplify how we work, drive innovation and grow our business is a challenging one. However and more importantly, it is also providing us with great opportunities to demonstrate the value of our offerings to our clients as we continue to simplify the client experience.Through these collective efforts and with the continued strength of both our R&D organization and our worldwide sales force, we are enhancing the depth and scale of our ability to serve our clients wherever they do business with best-in-class products and solutions that fit their needs.Our clients in turn are recognizing these efforts as we continue to see improvements in both our net promoter scores as well as in our Employer Services revenue retention. It is due to the success of these efforts that we remain committed to additional shareholder friendly actions such as our recent dividend increases of nearly 45% over the past two years.Our track record of annual increases in our dividend puts us in a small minority with 30 other companies in the S&P 500 that have also grown their dividend for 45 consecutive years or more. As we look forward to the future, we remain confident that our strategy is the right one as we aim to further strengthen our resilient business model in order to drive sustainable long-term value for our shareholders.Before I turn it over to Kathleen for a detailed financial review, I want you to know how proud I am of the external recognitions that we received this quarter which reflect the strong corporate culture on which our business is built. As I reflect on our recent efforts, I'm especially proud that FORTUNE magazine again name us to their most admired companies list for the 14th consecutive time and also rank us number one in our sector. This is a remarkable achievement and a rewarding recognition for the efforts of our associates who are focused on providing our clients the best solutions both for today and for the future.I am also particularly pleased to see our efforts reflected in the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Drucker Institute list of best managed companies where we were one of the biggest movers jumping 104 places into the top quartile. These are only some of the great recognitions that we are receiving for our efforts to create opportunities for all of our stakeholders.And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kathleen for her commentary on our results and the fiscal 2020 outlook. Kathleen Winters : Thank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. As Carlos mentioned, we\u2019re pleased with our continued progress in delivering growth for our shareholders and this quarter was no exception. This quarter\u2019s reported revenue growth of 5% and 6% organic constant currency is slightly ahead of our expectations and we\u2019re particularly pleased given the difficult compare to our second quarter of fiscal 2019.Our adjusted EBIT increased 9% and adjusted EBIT margin was up 70 basis points compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019, both also slightly ahead of expectations due to the timing of our progress across our multiple transformation initiative.Our margin improvement continues to benefit from a combination of cost savings related to our transformation initiative and operating efficiencies. These benefits were partially offset by growth in PEO zero-margin benefits pass-through expenses, increased selling and marketing expenses and amortization expense.Similar to the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we\u2019re particularly pleased with our margin performance given the difficult compare that we faced in the first half of the year resulting from the outsized benefits in fiscal 2019 related to our Voluntary Early Retirement Program.Our adjusted effective tax rate decreased by 260 basis points to 22% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019. The decrease is in line with our expectations and was mainly due to the release of a valuation allowance related to foreign tax credit carry forwards.Adjusted diluting earnings per share grew 13% to $1.52 and in addition to benefiting from our revenue growth, margin expansion and a lower adjusted effective tax rate was also aided by fewer shares outstanding compared to a year ago.Moving on to Employer Services segment and interest on funds held for clients, Employer Services revenues were slightly ahead of expectations and grew 4% reported and organic constant currency. Interest income on client funds grew 7% and benefited from growth in average client funds balances of 6% to 25.1 billion. This growth in balances continues to be driven by a combination of client growth, wage inflation and growth in our pays per control.Our Employer Services same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.2% for the second quarter. Employer Services margins increased 30 basis points in the quarter driven by the same factors that I mentioned earlier when discussing our consolidated results.Our PEO segment revenues grew 9% for the quarter to 1.1 billion and average worksite employees grew 6% to 579,000. Revenues, excluding zero-margin benefits pass-throughs, grew 7% to 412 million and continued to include pressure from lower workers\u2019 compensation and SUI costs and related pricing.Our value proposition in the PEO remains strong as evidenced by our double-digit PEO new business bookings growth this quarter. Our midmarket sales channel continues to grow following the realignment of our sales incentives and we\u2019re seeing continued signs of positive traction within our downmarket referral channel.With these factors in mind, we remain optimistic in our ability to reaccelerate the PEO in the latter part of fiscal 2020. Margins in the PEO decreased about 30 basis points for the quarter largely due to a difficult compare and an increase in selling expenses resulted from our strong quarterly new business bookings growth.Let's turn to the outlook for the full year and start with the PEO. With six months behind us now and our year-to-day average worksite employee growth and revenues tracking slightly below our expectations, we do not expect to achieve the higher end of our previous guidance range.As such, we are narrowing our guidance and now expect 9% to 10% PEO revenue growth in fiscal 2020 and 7% to 8% growth in PEO revenues, excluding zero-margin benefits pass-throughs, both driven by an anticipated growth of 7% to 8% in average worksite employees.As we also discussed last quarter, we continue to expect lower workers\u2019 compensation and SUI cost and related pricing to pressure our total PEO revenue growth. For PEO margin, we continue to anticipate margins to be flat to down 25 basis points in fiscal 2020. As we noted in previous calls, this outlook continues to include approximately 50 basis points of pressure from smaller favorable reserve adjustments at ADP Indemnity in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019.Moving on, let\u2019s take a look at Employer Services. We are narrowing our guidance to 4% revenue growth versus our prior outlook of 4% to 5% driven by a combination of continued unfavorability in FX and interest rates relative to our expectations coming into the year, and the lower bookings growth in the first half of fiscal 2020.We meanwhile continue to anticipate pays per control growth of about 2.5% and Employer Services revenue retention to improve 10 to 20 basis points. And we now expect Employer Services new business bookings growth of 6% to 7%. We continue to expect our margin in the Employer Services segment to expand by 100 to 125 basis points.We now anticipate total revenue growth of about 6% in fiscal 2020 as compared to our previous outlook of 6% to 7%. This revenue outlook continues to assume an elevated level of FX on favorability for fiscal 2020 relative to our expectations at the beginning of the year.We continue to anticipate our growth in average client fund balances to be about 4%, the average yield earned on our client fund investments to be about 2.2% and interest income on client funds to be between 570 million to 580 million. We also continue to expect interest income from our extended investment strategy to be 575 million to 585 million.We continue to anticipate our adjusted EBIT margin to expand 100 to 125 basis points. As a reminder, this guidance also continues to contemplate approximately 100 million in cost savings for fiscal 2020 related to our workforce optimization and procurement transformation initiatives.We now anticipate our adjusted effective tax rate to be 23.2%. The rate includes this quarter's unplanned tax benefit from stock-based compensation related to stock option exercises. It does not, however, include any further estimated tax benefit related to potential future stock option exercises given the dependency of that benefit on the timing of those exercises. We continue to expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to grow 12% to 14% in fiscal 2020.Finally, before we take your questions, I wanted to let you know that shortly after our February 10 Innovation Day, Christian will be moving on to take an international assignment as the General Manager of one of our European businesses. I want to thank Christian for his many contributions leading our Investor Relations program and also welcomed Danyal Hussain who many of you already know as our new Head of Investor Relations. Congratulations to both of you.With that, I will turn the call over to the operator to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thanks. I think one of the things we\u2019ve been focused on is the retention \u2013 the improvement in the retention. Can you give us any sense of how kind of the first half scaled relative to the full year guidance? Carlos Rodriguez : I think you can tell from our comments that it obviously improved in the second quarter and we\u2019ve tried to get away from \u2013 with the new guidance that we started providing I think was a year ago, we\u2019re trying to get away from quarterly guidance but we are still committed to giving you kind of a sense of kind of where we are. And I think you can tell from my prepared comments that we had a good first quarter and we also had a good second quarter. So retention is definitely a positive for us like we talked about last year in terms of some of the bright spots, our midmarket business retention continues to improve and is on track to really get through this year close to record levels. So it\u2019s very satisfying because we went through a very difficult time back in the day where we did all of the client upgrades and migrations and then with ACA at the same time, that was a business where we really had a real step back of retention. By the way, step back for us is a couple percentage points. Now we have recovered all of that and are kind of on track to get back to kind of where we were at record levels. Kevin McVeigh : Understood. And then just -- Carlos Rodriguez : I\u2019m sorry, another comment was I think we also in the first half have had good retention in the upmarket which was another place it\u2019s been kind of a challenge for us over the last couple of years. So I think both of those businesses \u2013 when you combine them, they are a significant portion of our revenues and I think have a solid retention performance. Kevin McVeigh : That\u2019s super helpful. As a quick follow up, despite the revenue adjustment, seems like you\u2019re maintaining the margin guidance. I guess what\u2019s driving that outperformance given kind of the revenue adjustments in the PEO and I guess overall? Carlos Rodriguez : We have \u2013 our business model is interesting because sometimes at least for the first half as you could tell we\u2019re hoping and planning on a recovery in terms of our sales results for the second half. But in general we benefitted in the first half from an expense standpoint from having weaker new business bookings, because as you know our business has a little bit of a soft adjusting factor. Now the new 606 rules I think when you amortize some of these costs over time, they blunt some of that impact but there\u2019s still some impact from that. So we did benefit from that and we just have a lot of good things going on from a margin standpoint. We really want to make sure that we focus on the growth as well, but we feel pretty good about the initiatives that we put in place call it last fiscal year that are impacting this year\u2019s cost structure. And I think those \u2013 we talked about those as procurement initiatives, also the workforce optimization which was a delayering exercise where we reduced spends and control, so we took three layers out and increased spends across the board including all the way at the very highest levels where we had for us I would call it a significant decrease in overhead, if you will, in terms of \u2013 at our more senior levels. And so I think we\u2019re benefitting from all of those items and that\u2019s helping the margin. So we feel pretty good about where we are in terms of cost and margin. We have a lot of transformation initiatives around cost and margins and obviously we want to make sure that we focus on growth and new business bookings as well. Kathleen Winters : Yes. Not too much to add to that. Carlos has covered a lot of the points, but we\u2019re seeing the operating efficiency come through. We\u2019re executing on the transformation projects that we have in flight right now. Saw a little bit better than expected margin expansion in the second quarter, primarily some timing on some of the transformation work. But look, the teams executing really nicely on that, particularly on the procurement side and we\u2019re focused on continuing to do that and building the pipeline of additional opportunities. Carlos Rodriguez : And just one little item in terms of color, you\u2019ll see from the Q that credit to the organization \u2013 again, a lot of these transformation initiatives have been \u2013 some of them when we talk about them, they\u2019re the big ones. We have dozens of other initiatives that are really improving the way we work automating things, taking out kind of non-value-added work. And when you look at our Q, you\u2019ll see that really R&D and selling expense that have increased and we really are holding the line on the rest of our operating expenses due in large part to some of these initiatives that we have underway that are making work a little bit easier for our associates and also taking some of the work out. And so that\u2019s the key because we want to make sure that we keep and we are keeping our NPS scores and our retention high. So that\u2019s the magic formula there. I think keeping our expenses lower and improving margin if it results in lower client satisfaction, lower retention is not going to help us in the long term, but fortunately and again credit to the associates and to the management team, we\u2019re actually pulling it off where we\u2019re getting both of those things right now. Kevin McVeigh : Super. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tien- tsin Huang : Thanks. Good morning and congrats to Christian and Danny. I want to ask on \u2013 I guess a big picture question maybe for the team just balancing \u2013 you\u2019re balancing the new tech investments, you just mentioned the transformation initiatives in the pipeline there, but just given that you\u2019re early \u2013 you\u2019re on track to get to your fiscal year targets this year \u2013 for fiscal '20, I\u2019m sorry. Are you more willing to invest and stay in the short to midterm to maybe energize revenue growth and get that up a little bit more, or is your preference to still hit the higher end of your long-term margin target? Just trying to understand how you might be balancing revenue growth and margin expansion given where you are now? Carlos Rodriguez : That\u2019s a great question and I think our Board obviously has that discussion with us as well. And I think our Board is very long-term oriented. And so as much as we\u2019re committed to hitting all individual components, it\u2019s about balancing all of those factors to really create long-term sustainable growth. And we would love to have as much growth as possible. And when I think about where are some of those places that we could invest, as an example like in our sales organization, we are fully staffed. I think we\u2019re probably a little bit ahead of our plans in terms of our headcount. So we clearly have some execution issues there, especially as we mentioned in our international and multinational businesses and some difficult compares over the last year, but we have really strong performance in the downmarket and in the midmarket and even in the domestic upmarket this quarter. So it doesn\u2019t feel like we\u2019re under investing. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure that we\u2019re not under investing in sales and marketing. We also have a brand campaign that we\u2019ve invested in over the last year which has added some expense. So I think we\u2019ve put our money where our mouth is when it comes to sales and marketing. And then turning to the other obvious places where we could invest again for growth and product in our R&D organization, again, R&D grew but always say that we could spend more. But when I look at the year-over-year and even a three-year growth of our investments in our Next-Gen platforms and even some of the additional feature functionality that we\u2019re adding to our existing product, including user experience, that\u2019s again a place where our investments are growing. So you can see it from our depreciation and amortization line, when you see it in the Q and you can see it and hear it from our words that we are \u2013 you can see in our balance sheet in terms of capitalized software. So we believe that we are investing for the future and that we have \u2013 sometimes you have these timing issues because we do have a lot of enthusiasm, for example, about our Next-Gen platforms. But relative to the size of the company, this is the first year where we have \u2013 over the last 12 months is the first time we\u2019ve actually got clients now live on our Next-Gen platforms, including Next-Gen payroll and Next-Gen HCM which we call Lifion. So we\u2019re excited. We\u2019re ahead of plan. But you have less than 10 clients on one of the platforms and call it 30 to 40 clients on another one of those platforms, so it just doesn\u2019t make a difference yet in terms of the sales results or the revenue results, but it doesn\u2019t dampen our enthusiasm around the future. So again, I guess the long and short of it is I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a lack of investment, but trust us that if we see an opportunity to invest for growth, we will take it. Tien- tsin Huang : Understood. And then just maybe on that point with the U.S. bookings, it sounds like it\u2019s more international again. So I\u2019m curious if this is more cyclical or is there some very broad base or is it more \u2013 just a few select clients just looking for a decision, just trying to better understand the visibility here on the international side? Carlos Rodriguez : I think the most obvious one in terms of because it\u2019s easy to see and quantify is in our large Global View multinational deals, we had a very difficult compare. Now, of course, that means that 12 months ago we were celebrating getting those deals and those sales and also we talked about it that that was giving us tailwind at the time when I think we did, but we\u2019d have to go back to the transcripts. And now unfortunately now we have a very difficult compare. Now we just had our rethink meeting, we call it rethink meeting where we have all of our large multinational prospects and clients and I think we walked away with a very solid pipeline and a lot of enthusiasm. And so we feel good about hopefully the second half. And whether it\u2019s the second half or next year, but any less enthusiastic about our multinational solutions but we just have a very difficult compare. So that\u2019s an obvious place. We do have a couple of what we call in-country or best-of-breed locations that are also having some challenges that I think also have some difficult compares. But it\u2019s hard to point at any kind of cyclical or product issues, because we\u2019ve been strengthening our products overseas as well and I think investing in our sales force. So again \u2013 and European economy in particular seems to be at a minimum stabilizing if not improving. So I don\u2019t think we can point to anything cyclical which is why we remain optimistic about the turnaround. Kathleen Winters : Yes. So maybe I\u2019ll just add a little more color and talk about it in terms of kind of U.S. bookings overall. I guess what I\u2019d say is that, look, as you go into the year there\u2019s always going to be areas where you do better and areas where you do worse than you may have planned. And thus far into the year we\u2019ve seen particular strength in downmarket as we\u2019ve noted in our comments. And actually internationally we\u2019ve also seen strength in our Celergo streamline product which was quite nice to see. And as you saw, the multinational Global View is where we were seeing really the slowness or the weakness for the last two quarters now. It\u2019s hard to say that it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re not really seeing that it\u2019s attributable to any change from an economic landscape or environment standpoint but more so just seeing delayed decision making and it\u2019s taking time to get these larger and sometimes much more complex deals through the decision making process. So we\u2019ve seen it two quarters in a row. The pipeline looks pretty decent. We\u2019ve got some of these deals in the pipeline, but remains to be seen exactly how much longer it takes to get them closed. Tien- tsin Huang : Okay. Thanks. See you in a couple of weeks. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Your line is open. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Could I ask you to give us kind of a brief macro overview in terms of what you\u2019re seeing in your various markets given everything that\u2019s going on in the world today, any callouts or any changes in the environment? Carlos Rodriguez : So when we look at \u2013 we have a few things that we obviously look at in terms of, call it economic macro indicators. The ones that are kind of relatively stable I would call them relatively stable or pace for control and wage growth and we look at obviously our own data as we get ready for this earnings call but we also have the ADP research institute that publishes its own kind of wage growth information and other factors around the economy. And I think all those signs positive point to what I would call stability. Our pace for control was slightly lower than it was the previous quarter in that trend, but we\u2019ve seen that many times before where we go 2.5% one quarter and then we go a little bit lower the next quarter, but then it comes back to 2.5%. It does seem and we\u2019ve been saying it and we\u2019ve been wrong so far that as the labor markets tighten, there\u2019s just not enough people available in the U.S. to continue to drive the kind of pace for control work that we\u2019ve experienced. But obviously labor force participation has been ticking up slightly and for a variety of reasons that\u2019s continued to hum along. And again, we see the same kind of indicators that all of you see around consumer spending, et cetera. So when we look across all of our domestic businesses, the pace for control growth seems to be a reasonable indictor that the economy is on stable ground. And wage growth we think should continue to accelerate, but that\u2019s moderated slightly also for the last couple of quarters but it\u2019s still at robust levels and should drive continued consumer spending and continued consumer confidence. We do look at pace for control also outside of the U.S. and I think there we again in our numbers see some signs of stabilization in Europe when it comes through on the unemployment and pace for control metrics there. So for us I think that everything looks \u2013 bankruptcies are \u2013 we\u2019re seeing the same things at our own business that you see through external metrics. We don\u2019t see any kind of elevation or increase in out of business or bankruptcies in our downmarket business, which is the canary in the coal mines, the first place you would see it. And our sales are also strong in the downmarket and the midmarket, so it doesn\u2019t feel like the weakness we had this quarter is anything other than the lumpiness that we talked about around multinationals, because new business bookings would be another I think macro indicator that could weaken. We talked about our retention continuing to improve. Retention doesn\u2019t improve in a bad economy, because it \u2013 that\u2019s one of the things that really suffers as a result of out of business in a downmarket and that has stayed strong and solid. So no negatives that we can see in the macro. Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. And you\u2019ve sort of addressed this. Dovetailing with Kathleen's last answer and your answer just now, but can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment and that doesn\u2019t manifesting itself as sort of pricing-related actions or an intensification of maybe more an increasing opposing bidders showing up for contract processes or new business models emerging out there. I\u2019m just trying to explore whether there\u2019s any other peripheral causes for some of I think what are timing-related delays in things like bookings especially maybe in Europe but elsewhere as well? Carlos Rodriguez : Sure. So back to maybe a little bit of what Kathleen said about, there\u2019s always \u2013 there\u2019s positive and there\u2019s negative. When it comes to competitors, it\u2019s the same thing. We have a lot of competitors in each of our segments and some years we do better, some years we do worse, but we do have the overall balance of trade and our situation there is better. And you would think that based on our retention results and based on the comments we just gave you about new business bookings in our downmarket, midmarket and domestic upmarket business. So I think in North America I think if you look at those results, I would say our competitive situation has improved and it shows in our net balance of trade that we keep track of. Particular I would point out besides the continued strength in our downmarket business which has been growing market share here for a few years, if you look at our midmarket business, the last two quarters in particular were quite strong in terms of what we call new logos against a variety of competitors. But again, we can\u2019t point to any one competitor because we have a large set of competitors. Some of them are geographically concentrated and some of them are national, but I think we\u2019re very pleased with this quarter\u2019s performance against those competitors in the midmarket. And then in the upmarket I would say that the addition of Workforce Now and call it the 1,000 to 5,000 range, so the lower end of our upmarket which we did a couple of years ago has really been an important generator of win-loss and balance of trade success for us in the upmarket. So we\u2019ve had a robust growth in units and revenue and sales dollars from introduction of Workforce Now into that 1,000 to 5,000 which addresses a segment of the market where that platform really has a lot of appeal. Ramsey El-Assal: That is super helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Your line is open. Jason Kupferberg : Hi. Good morning, guys. I just want to drill in a little bit more on the commentary around the delayed decision making. Have you guys been down selected for these contracts already or is the actual RFP process still kind of dragging along? Carlos Rodriguez : I wish I could tell you that I have that level of detail. I don\u2019t. So this is really \u2013 it ties back to the comment I made before about we have a certain number of sales people in the field, we have a certain pipeline of dollars that we track year-over-year and we know what our sales results were the previous year in the same period whether it was the first quarter or the first two quarters of the year. So we are attributing the weakness to the late decision making. But this is not \u2013 we do have large contracts particularly in multinational and they definitely move the number from one quarter to the other, but we don\u2019t have $50 million, $100 million contracts. It\u2019s not that kind of business. So I don\u2019t put \u2013 I know our sales leaders have that level of detail. I don\u2019t have it available at my fingertips here. Kathleen Winters : Yes, maybe you\u2019re asking kind of have we seen any particular shift in where things are in terms of stages of the cycle and stages in the pipeline. Nothing that we\u2019ve seen or heard that we can draw any conclusion from or point to any trends. Carlos Rodriguez : But we do have pipeline of deals \u2013 sure, we went into rethink this year with more participants, more attendees and a larger pipeline of dollar opportunity than we had the previous year. Jason Kupferberg : Right. I was just curious if you were just kind of waiting for some final signatures to make the bookings official or if it really is a matter of kind of just broader pipeline conversion. Just my second quick follow up just on the margins. You had the 70 bps up overall in the quarter, which was better than you expected, but at the segment level I know ES was up only 30 and PEO was down 30 if I\u2019m not mistaken. So I think it was some of the below the line drivers that got you to the 70. Can you elaborate on those because I know you have some add backs in your adjusted EBIT margin calculation? Carlos Rodriguez : Yes, I can help maybe a little bit with that. As you know, the transformation initiatives that we are undergoing right now, some of those are sort of back office facing as well. So if you think about procurement and the workforce optimization initiative, those will have impacts to items that what we would deem other in the segment review. So corporate functions, for example, that\u2019s where the delta probably sits for you. Jason Kupferberg : Okay, great. Thank you, guys. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon from Baird. Your line is open. Mark Marcon : Good morning. Let me add my congratulations to both Christian and Danny. With regards to the bookings, just looking ahead and thinking about the comparisons for the third and fourth quarters, are there things that we should think from a sequencing perspective in terms of they\u2019re both \u2013 one\u2019s up 10%, one\u2019s up 11%. Is there anything that\u2019s particular in one versus the other that would make it a more difficult comp or how should we think about the bookings over the next two quarters in terms of the sequencing? Carlos Rodriguez : I think our number one goal is to obviously maintain the momentum we have in everything other than our international and multinational businesses. And again, these businesses not just because of the big ocean between them, they are fairly separate, right, in terms of how they\u2019re managed in terms of sales and sales execution and so forth even though we have one worldwide sales organization. So we feel good that we\u2019re going to be able to maintain the momentum we have in the rest of the business and then hopefully we get a little bit of tailwind with some of this stuff going our way in terms of the larger deals and some of the international stuff that we talked about. We do have in the second half, particularly in the last quarter, we do have a difficult compare because last year as you recall we purchased \u2013 it was a client-based acquisition \u2013 an acquisition of the company with a client-based acquisition of Wells Fargo\u2019s payroll business and that helped our new business bookings and obviously translated into some revenue helping in a downmarket and it was part of what\u2019s given us some tailwind from a revenue growth standpoint in that business. But since it was a client-based acquisition, it does \u2013 and it wasn\u2019t an acquisition of a business, it does roll through our new business bookings and that was I believe in the fourth quarter. Mark Marcon : That\u2019s [indiscernible] and that\u2019s part of the reason for asking the question. So arguably the third quarter should be a little bit of an easier comp. Carlos Rodriguez : For some reason they never feel easy, but mathematically \u2013 you\u2019re probably mathematically correct. But we have a lot of things that we\u2019re cooking to make sure that we hit \u2013 obviously our intention is to achieve the guidance we provided and we don\u2019t provide it lightly. Mark Marcon : Great. And then, Carlos, obviously you\u2019ve got a longstanding set of experiences with the PEO market. How are you feeling about the longer-term trajectory of the market? What are you thinking or ex pass-throughs, the sustainable growth rate is there? And what are you seeing on the competitive front? It seems like there\u2019s a little bit more private capital that\u2019s coming into the space. So just wondering how you\u2019re thinking about that space and the legislative outlook there? Carlos Rodriguez : Well, when you look at again the balance of trade information there, I feel pretty good about our competitive situation. So you always feel good about your own children, about your business, but you got to look at the facts, right. And I think the facts are pretty good for us in terms of our win-loss in our balance of trade. So that feels pretty good. And then the second thing that makes me feel really good particularly in this quarter versus last year and started to feel it last quarter is we really took a while to kind of filter through to make sure that we had our incentives properly aligned to make sure that our sales force is focused on obviously, number one, selling the right thing to our clients but making sure that they\u2019re properly incented to make sure that the PEO is something that they raise, because it\u2019s a difficult sale, because it\u2019s a high involvement sale and so you have to have the right incentives in order for the sales force to really want to sell it. And so I think we did that and I think we talked about that. It\u2019s got to be 12 months ago I think it was. So that feels like it\u2019s starting to filter through and I think we talked about very strong double-digit new business bookings for the quarter which that\u2019s the most important metric for the future to really give us confidence that the business model is still strong and intact. So that feels pretty good. Mark Marcon : Terrific. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Samad Samana from Jefferies. Your line is open. Samad Samana : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to maybe ask a question about what\u2019s been going on in terms of bookings and how you\u2019re thinking about guidance. Was guidance updated just to reflect what bookings has done so far this year or have you may be made some changes to the guidance framework to account for some more of the variability or variance that you\u2019re seeing in multinational or international deals closing? So I guess is guidance more conservative or are you using the same framework that you\u2019ve historically used? And then maybe just one follow up. Carlos Rodriguez : Yes. Again, just a reminder just given the last comment that I made about the PEO that the guidance that we provide for bookings is ES only just to be clear. So if you look at our combination of our PEO and ES sales, it\u2019s a better picture and a stronger picture in the first half than what our guidance would depict, because we provide guidance for the PEO based on average worksite employee growth, not on new business bookings. But having said that, I think the answer is just \u2013 this year like there\u2019s no change in our thinking or our framework given that we just think there\u2019s some large deal delays that I don\u2019t think impact our deal in the future. Kathleen Winters : Yes, no change in framework, no change in kind of the way we\u2019re rolling up that forecast or the data we\u2019re looking at. For example, we look at things like, okay, where\u2019s business coming from in terms of by segment or by geography or new clients versus upsell to existing clients. We\u2019re continuing to see fairly consistent trends in terms of the split between new and upsell. So no change in the framework. It\u2019s more so just, look, we\u2019ve seen slower out of the gates for two quarters now, lower than we expected in international. And so we thought it was \u2013 given that we\u2019re six months into the year here, we thought it made sense to give you our best view. So, therefore, we narrowed the view for the year. Carlos Rodriguez : Yes. Just one other comment in terms of something little bit quirky about as we changed our guidance to focus on ES worldwide bookings versus the PEO based on average worksite employees. The reason we gave you some color about the bookings for the PEO this quarter is even though we\u2019re not going to change the way we do our guidance is in some respects what\u2019s good for the PEO sometimes in the short term if business gets referred to the PEO, it can have in the short term a dampening effect on Employer Services. But we still had a great result in the downmarket and in the midmarket in Employer Services. So we definitely can\u2019t point to that. But again, it is kind of important to keep in mind that it\u2019s really the combination of those two that are driving overall ADP bookings and overall ADP revenue growth. Samad Samana : Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe if I could just ask one follow up. I think there\u2019s a lot of excitement around Lifion coming off of HR tech and ahead of the Innovation Day that the company is hosting. So I just wanted to see if there\u2019s any early patterns in terms of customer profile, whether it\u2019s by size or whether \u2013 what do you think about existing products that they\u2019re using, whether it\u2019s Vantage or Workforce Now, maybe where are you seeing the early adopters come from and any type of profile commentary you could give on that would be helpful? Thank you. Carlos Rodriguez : So again, in our case everybody\u2019s maybe approaches it differently, but we started off with smaller, less complex clients and now we\u2019ve actually just sold I\u2019ll call \u2013 consider it to be very large clients, so call it tens of thousands of employees. And so we\u2019ve got a couple of very large sales that we\u2019ve done and we have a bunch in the middle and then we have a few smaller ones that we did in the early days. Some of the business we\u2019ve sold is obviously new logo, some of it has been as you mentioned off of some of our existing platforms. I don\u2019t think that I can point to one particular platform and say that we\u2019re not targeting \u2013 because we\u2019re not trying to do migration or upgrades. We\u2019re trying to go after clients that have the right profile and the right needs, right, so that we can make them happier ADP clients in the long term. So we know what the capabilities are of the platform and we try to target the clients and the prospects whether they\u2019re internal or external in the appropriate manner. So I guess the best way to put it is it\u2019s kind of across the board in terms of \u2013 from an internal view. And then in terms of industry or size of client, fortunately it\u2019s also kind of a wide spread. Samad Samana : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning. There have been a few questions on bookings already, but this seems to be the main question of the day. The one question that I\u2019d like to explore here is you\u2019re still in the critical selling season which typically runs December to February. So is there anything you see in your pipeline in the U.S. or confidence on international close rates that gives you the confidence that you can close this critical selling season in better shape that we\u2019ve seen obviously in the second quarter and the first quarter bookings results? Carlos Rodriguez : So again, at the risk of getting too much into the sausage making, if you remember like part of our business particularly downmarket and into some of our midmarket, we report our sales when they start. So they\u2019re \u2013 like bookings and starts are basically equivalent. But when you get to very large deals, that\u2019s where you\u2019re really recognizing a sale and then the revenue starts at a later date. It could be six months, it could be 12 months. With a very large complex international deal, it could be 18 months later. So to your point about the critical selling season, pretty much now and done because January is the biggest month for us particularly for our downmarket business and the lower end of our midmarket business as well and the PEO. So just because of a natural cycle of the PEO, a large number of clients \u2013 by the way affect retention as well, but from a new business bookings standpoint January is the critical month for us. So the December-January period is the critical month for us in the PEO. And again, we\u2019re in the middle of that quarter so it\u2019s kind of hard to make comments about the quarter since the quarter isn\u2019t done yet. But I think in a downmarket and in our PEO in particular, we had I\u2019d say a good start to the quarter. Kathleen Winters : Yes. The only other thing I would add and this is with regard to the ES bookings in particular, if you kind of look at the cadence of the year last year and this year and you look at six months year-to-date, we\u2019re at about the same point this year as we were last year in comparison to where we ended the year. David Togut : So in other words, you see enough in the pipeline at this point and expect to close rates that drive your expectation of the 6% to 7% bookings target. Is that accurate? Carlos Rodriguez : I think that \u2013 again, that is a level of detail to say that we have specific things in the pipeline. I think just to reiterate what we said before, so the number one driver of our confidence in our sales results in most of our business is headcount and execution and we believe we\u2019re fully staffed and we have that headcount in place. In the place where we\u2019ve had the variability or the volatility, if you will, it does come down to what you\u2019re describing which is RFPs, pipeline, et cetera. Yes, we do believe we have the pipeline and the visibility of that pipeline to feel that we will close the gap for the rest of the year. But that\u2019s not \u2013 in our SBS business, in our downmarket business, it doesn\u2019t work that way. It\u2019s really more about the volume \u2013 it\u2019s a volume business. It\u2019s really related to having the proper amount of headcount, the right digital marketing tools and spend and again there we feel good and we feel confident. David Togut : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeffrey Silber : Thanks so much. I\u2019m apologizing for asking another bookings related question. I just wanted to clarify something. I\u2019m assuming that most of your clients are in calendar year-end as opposed to your June year-end. When you talk about the late decision making, does this mean that decisions are being deferred until another year from now or is it something that could happen within the next quarter or so? Carlos Rodriguez : So the good news for ADP is we have clients with all kinds of year-ends because we have a lot of clients. So really it spans the gamut. But you\u2019re right that probably the average company in the U.S. has a calendar year-end. But I think most large companies and particularly multinationals which I would consider ADP to one of those, we typically when we are negotiating with a vendor for a large contract, we\u2019d be focused more on their fiscal year-end rather than our own fiscal year-end. And so you\u2019re right that there are some drivers around people\u2019s budgets and so forth, but a lot of procurement departments tend to focus on the vendors year-end. And so we\u2019ve seen historically \u2013 doesn\u2019t mean that it will happen again this year \u2013 is that our fourth quarter for large domestic and especially for large multinational deals is a particularly important quarter because prospects are recognized that even though we\u2019re not like a typical software company that negotiating towards a company\u2019s fiscal year end at least in their minds tends to be a good time to sign deals or negotiate. Jeffrey Silber : Okay. I appreciate that -- Christian Greyenbuhl : Sorry, Jeff, just one reminder. I know we said it before, but the 1% impact on an annual basis in business bookings equating to that 17 million, these multinational particularly Global View deals, you can imagine that if you take that on a quarterly basis, it does have \u2013 just to put it in perspective that outsized impact. So from a framing perspective, it is a pretty meaningful adjustment if you have some of these deals that flow in from one quarter to the next given that sensitivity. Carlos Rodriguez : On the new business bookings results. Christian Greyenbuhl : On the new business bookings results. Carlos Rodriguez : Right. Because on revenue \u2013 as you just described, the irony of the situation is that it doesn\u2019t have a big impact on revenue. We\u2019re having issues with FX and with client funds interest in particular are hurting us. It\u2019s not to deny that the bookings eventually will have some impact. The types of bookings that we have fallen short on in the first half are not particularly revenue impactful. Jeffrey Silber : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I do appreciate the color on that. And then I know you don\u2019t give quarterly guidance, but you called out I guess the comp on the \u201cacquisition\u201d of the Wells Fargo payroll business last year. Anything else to call out between 3Q and 4Q that might affect the cadence of those quarters? Thanks. Carlos Rodriguez : In terms of new business bookings? Jeffrey Silber : No, the overall business either revenues or margins? Carlos Rodriguez : Well, again, back to revenues and margins, the client funds interest issue and again going back to kind of the three-year guidance that we gave a few years ago, again, obviously not expecting a lot of sympathy from this crowd, but we\u2019re probably about $100 million less than where we expected to be in terms of client funds interest and we\u2019re obviously able to overcoming some of that as we go forward. So that in the second half is actually going to according to what I\u2019m seeing in terms of our forecast. That\u2019s going to start to have an impact on revenue growth as well, not a huge impact but where we were getting call it 1% lift in terms of revenue growth last year in the second quarter, I think this second quarter it was a much smaller number and in the second half it goes to probably no help to actually hurting our revenue growth. So that\u2019s a headwind for us. But when I really take out all these issues; FX, client funds interest and other kind of calendar noise issues, when you look at the net impact of new business bookings starts, not new business bookings sales but new business bookings starts minus losses. So if you take retention and new business that have started, if you compare last year\u2019s second quarter to this year\u2019s second quarter and hopefully the same thing continues into the second half, we have a slight acceleration. It\u2019s not a huge acceleration, but a slight acceleration. So that\u2019s what makes me feel good about the strength in the underlying business because there\u2019s a lot of noise happening in between with calendar and remember last year, we also had a one-time item that we mentioned that we called SUI pull forward in the PEO and accounting change that we were obligated to make that helped the second quarter revenue growth. And so all those things you have to kind of separate all those and get down to the core of the business and how the core business is performing. And on that basis, I feel good about the quarter and I feel good about the second half. Kathleen Winters : Yes, the only other thing I would add to your question about kind of quarterly linearity in the balance of the year. Just as a reminder, in the second half of last year we had much, much more margin expansion in Q3 than in Q4. So, therefore, tougher comps for us this year Q3 versus Q4 in terms of margin expansion. So while we don\u2019t give quarterly guidance, I would expect not a whole lot in Q3 and then potentially much more in Q4. Carlos Rodriguez : But again, back to like \u2013 in terms of what I mentioned in terms of some of these comparisons that were difficult versus last year\u2019s second quarter, some of those things then get easier on a revenue standpoint, notwithstanding the issues from client funds interest as we pull forward actually helped last year\u2019s second quarter, but depressed our third quarter. So that\u2019s going to make an easier comparison. So we do expect slight improvement in our revenue growth in the second half. Christian Greyenbuhl : And just a brief reminder of the fourth quarter, so as a reminder, so we did the client-based acquisition. So that added some amortization expense, which will lap in the fourth quarter and obviously it would increase booking expense related to the client-based acquisition as well. So just keep that in mind. And then we obviously launched our brand campaign I think in the third quarter, but most of that was really the expense was kicking off in the fourth quarter as well. So that will be lapped as well. Jeffrey Silber : So I guess what you\u2019re saying is you got some tailwinds in the fourth quarter. Christian Greyenbuhl : Yes. Jeffrey Silber : All right. Thank you for clarifying that. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And we have time for one final question. And our last question will come from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Lisa Ellis : Hi. Good morning, guys, and thanks for squeezing me in. Congrats to Christian and Danny from me as well. Carlos, you mentioned a couple of times and I think in the presentation the progress on both Lifion as well as the Next-Gen payroll and tax. Can you give an update on where you are on the deployments of the Next-Gen payroll and tax engines and how they\u2019re impacting your business perhaps on the retention side or some of the other impacts? Thank you. Carlos Rodriguez : Sure. Thanks. Very excited about the Next-Gen payroll as well as the back office tax, but the payroll engine even though it\u2019s somewhat back office I think has some positive qualities in terms of potentially helping us both in terms of \u2013 in the future both around bookings but also around efficiency and cost. I think we have somewhere between 30 and 40 live clients in our Next Generation payroll platform suite. As you can imagine, in comparison to the size of ADP, it\u2019s a relatively small impact in terms of revenue retention or any of the other actual metrics. But enormous amount of enthusiasm around what we\u2019re doing there, both at the team level. I think the team is incredibly enthusiastic and I think the rest of the organization is very enthusiastic as well in terms of what we\u2019re seeing in the early days, especially around the flexibility of how quickly we can, for example, make changes and that\u2019s just related really to the investments in the platform itself. So we\u2019ve already kind of experimented and I think we maybe talked about this in the past with kind of federation as you call it in trying to have others develop and build on that platform. We\u2019ve done the same thing on Lifion. And so now we have a team, for example, in Australia that is actually built Australian payroll and we have one or two clients on that as well. And so we\u2019re incredibly happy with what we\u2019re seeing. We\u2019re really happy that we have live clients and this is the first year that \u2013 again, even though it was, call it 30 to 40 clients, this was the first time we\u2019ve gone through year-end. So we actually had to go through a year end and do all the year-end closing activities, W2s, et cetera. So it\u2019s still very early days just because of the size of ADP, but if we were a start-up, this would be like really great news. Like this was the \u2013 if this was a discussion about a start-up like we\u2019ve got now a lot of technical risk behind us, if you will, and now we have scaling and execution risk that\u2019s still in front of us. But that\u2019s a hell of a lot better than where we would have been two to three years ago, and I think it could really add to our competitiveness here in the long run, not to mention to help a lot in terms of our back office costs. On the tax side, that\u2019s probably more focused on back office cost and efficiency, but that also has an impact on our associates in terms of their ability to deliver service and also the experience that our clients have when we do things like amendments and tax notices. And so, again, the news there is very positive. We have \u2013 I think it\u2019s close to 140,000 to 150,000? Kathleen Winters : Yes, about 140,000 clients. Carlos Rodriguez : About 140,000 clients. Obviously, those are smaller downmarket clients in a limited number of jurisdictions. But I think we\u2019ve now \u2013 we\u2019re up to 20 \u2013 more than 20 jurisdictions. Jurisdictions by the way refers to number of states in addition to federal, places where we can actually do the taxes. And so I\u2019d say that that\u2019s progressing also very, very well. Again, a highly flexible platform that we\u2019re very optimistic in terms of what it can do to us down the road and see no scaling issues so far in either of those platforms. Lisa Ellis : Excellent. Thank you. That seems like a good point to end on. I\u2019ll see you guys in a couple of weeks. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for any closing remarks. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you. So as you can tell, we\u2019re pretty \u2013 we\u2019re pleased with the progress we continue to make on both the financials but also on our strategy. Obviously as we keep saying over and over again, we\u2019re trying to build on our success in the past but also transform for the future here so we can continue to deliver sustainable growth for many years to come.I also want to mention that this time of year as somebody mentioned about this being a busy time of the year for us from a sales standpoint, it\u2019s also a very busy time for our associates who deliver service and also our year-end commitments to our clients. It\u2019s very long hours and very hard work and I really appreciate the commitment of our associates. And again, it\u2019s one of the great differentiators we have in terms of being able to deliver that level of service, especially at a very busy time of the year like we are right now.Obviously, we wouldn\u2019t be able to be successful in the long run without strong products. And so when we have our Investor Day, we\u2019re going to hopefully lay out a plan for you about how the sustainability of the strength of ADP will be I think helped by the investments we\u2019ve been making over the last five years in our next generation products.So we look forward to spending time with you on February 10 to discuss all of these innovations that we\u2019ve been investing in, in addition to the Next-Gen platform and also discussing a little bit of our vision for the future about how we expect work to change and the HCM industry to change.And with that, I want to thank you once again for your interest in ADP and for joining us today. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Shannon, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Thank you, I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Danyal Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Danyal Hussain : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining ADP's Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Call and Webcast. Participating today are Carlos Rodriguez, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathleen Winters, our Chief Financial Officer.Earlier this morning, we released our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. The earnings materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompany today\u2019s call as well as our quarterly history of revenue and pretax earnings by reportable segment.During our call today, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description and the timing of these items, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measure, can be found in our earnings release. Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such, involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. As always, please do not hesitate to reach out should you have any questions. And with that, let me now turn the call over to Carlos. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you, Danny and thank everyone for joining our call. Before we can, I want to first say that our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been or know someone who has been impacted by COVID-19. Every day we hear about how much of a challenge it has been for employers and workers alike, including our own.I'd like to recognize our associates for rising to the challenge and delivering exceptional service to our clients despite the extraordinary circumstances they've had to face. To them, I want to say thank you. For our discussion today, we'll spend a little less time talking about the third quarter and more time on the current operating climate. And I'd like to offer a couple of upfront points.First is that ADP is not immune to the global pandemics impact on the labor market, but while we may make tactical adjustments as we navigate through this crisis, we believe our long-term strategy is unaffected and we remain optimistic about how we're positioned over the coming years, once the business environment and our clients return to more normal operations. The second point is that we will continue to serve our clients in the way we know best, by offering the tools, resources, and support they need to manage their business and their workforce through all types of operating environments, including this challenging one.With that said, this morning we reported our third quarter fiscal 2020 results with revenue of $4 billion up 6% reported and organic constant currency and in line with our expectations. We expanded our adjusted EBIT margin by 60 basis points in the quarter, which was ahead of our expectations, even though it included an unplanned [$50] [ph] million global associate assistance payment in response to COVID-19. And with the solid revenue and margin performance, we were pleased to deliver 8% adjusted diluted EPS growth, which was also a slightly ahead of our expectations coming into the quarter.Turning now to the current situation, I'd like to take a few minutes to go deeper on how COVID-19 has affected our operations and what we've done to respond. As the situation evolved over the past couple of months, we focused first on the safety of our associates. In March, we took steps to quickly shift over 50,000 of our associates to work from home and now have approximately 98% of our workforce working remotely in a secure manner. In doing so, we leveraged our previous investments in business resiliency and in addition we ordered thousands of laptops, expanded remote access capacity, provided at home internet and for those critical personnel that needed to work onsite, we took steps to ensure their safety while they perform those essential onsite tasks. This was a huge undertaking by our global IT, security and legal, and HR organizations and I'm extremely proud of their execution.We also worked with our critical third-party service providers to ensure they were positioned to continue to support us. In March, we also had our field sales force shifts from in-person to a virtual sales model, and while that's not an ideal circumstance for some of our quota carriers, they're making the most of the situation. While we were executing on these business resiliency plans, we also worked nonstop to address our client's needs to ensure uninterrupted service across our HCM solutions. We provide a mission critical service and process payroll for one in six Americans and over 40 million workers around the world, and to offer immediate support we\u2019ve provided a number of online resources including an employer preparedness toolkit and webinars attended by tens of thousands of clients. We also quickly made available for free the payroll costs and headcount reports necessary to apply for forgivable loans under the Paycheck Protection Program of the CARES Act and these reports have been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times.Service is more important than ever in times like this. We saw call volumes increased significantly beginning in March and have nearly 2 million inbound requests across our service channels in a matter of weeks, with clients looking for help with a variety of issues including adding custom pay codes related to COVID-19, redirecting checks to different locations and requesting new time tracking hardware that doesn't require physical contact. In many cases they were simply seeking general guidance in understanding new legislation. To meet our client's needs we retrained and quickly redeployed hundreds of associates to where they were needed most. And our service and IT teams worked quickly to digest and translate new legislation from the many jurisdictions around the world into our global payroll, time and attendance and other systems in a short period of time to allow our clients to comply with and benefit from these changes in legislation.As the environment for companies continues to evolve, whether due to legislative changes or operational realities, we at ADP are committed to supporting our clients to help them best navigate those changes. As we communicated in an open letter to U.S. policy leaders, ADP stands ready to facilitate current and future initiative that provides support to our clients and their workers. And in support of our local communities, ADP has made over $2 million in donations to relief efforts, including a dedicated relief fund for ADP associates that needed assistance as well as donations of medical supplies for hospitals, food banks, and their workers.With all that said, the significant impact of COVID-19 is having on a broader economy, is in turn having an effect on our reported metrics, in a much more abrupt fashion as compared to previous macro economic slowdowns. You can see this in our Employer Services new business bookings metric. This quarter we reported a decrease of 9%, as we saw bookings declined significantly and rapidly in mid-March when we typically would have expected to close many deals for the quarter. These results were of course well below our expectations coming into the quarter and while some of our businesses performed slightly better than others in March, the weakness was generally broad-based as the health crisis is affecting companies of all sizes and regions including internationally.We believe the impact to bookings stems from two factors. First is the buying behavior of our clients and prospects. As with prior uncertain economic environments, our clients and prospects have become time and resource-constrained and are faced with reassessing their own operations to best ride out the impact of this health crisis. And although our products support mission-critical functions, making decisions about additional HCM services or making the decision to switch from another vendor to ADP can get put off to a later time. Even in circumstances where decisions have already been made, clients are understandably delaying implementation which can also cause us to adjust down the bookings we record. The general change in behavior is common in recessionary periods and we are certainly not surprised to see it this time. It's clearly happening in a more abrupt manner compared to what we've experienced in the past.Second, as I mentioned earlier, there have naturally been constraints that limited the activity of our salesforce. What we have been able to lean more heavily on an inside sales strategy and virtual interactions by our field sales force. There has still been a reduction in our salesforce productivity. Our sales organization is experienced and resilient and we will continue to work hard in the fourth quarter. Because of a variety of factors which we believe will have an outside impact on the fourth quarter booking, including the effectiveness of the Paycheck Protection Program in supporting small to mid-sized businesses and how quickly our clients can adapt to working in this new environment and resume more normal buying behavior, there is clearly a very wide range of outcomes.But to calibrate your expectations, we are guiding for a full year ES New Business Bookings, our ES New Business bookings to be down 20% which implies our fourth quarter bookings will be down by more than 50%. With all that said, we remain confident in our product portfolio and optimistic about our ability to drive sustained growth in ES bookings in a sounder economic environment.I now like to spend a minute or two on some of the other macro driven trends we've observed in our client base. Our pays per control metric, which represents employee growth for a broad subset of our client base was solid through February, but decelerated to a slight negative growth by the end of March, averaging 1.9% growth for the quarter. Early in April, we saw it deteriorate further to a double digit negative decline, with the steepest decline among smaller businesses. For context, this level of pays per controlled decline is significantly worse than even the worst quarter in the financial crisis, underscoring that it's hard to compare this environment even against the past recessions. While we hope that legislation aimed at preserving employment will drive a recovery in pays per control, we had not seen it through mid-April.On retention, we were actually pleased with our performance in the third quarter, with both third quarter and year-to-date retention performance better than our expectations and ahead of pays per our previous annual guidance. We set all time third quarter retention record in our down market and mid-market businesses, as client satisfaction scores were at or near all time highs and as the benefits of our technology and migration strategy over the past several years continue to bear fruit. But clearly, out-of-business losses are a concern for the fourth quarter and beyond. And although they have not yet meaningfully picked up by the end of March or even into April, early indicators of stress in our client base have shown up and we expect deterioration in retention in May and June.Kathleen will share some of the assumptions for the fourth quarter when she goes through the outlook. I'd like to pivot now from the current macro environment and focus on our strategy and what we're doing to drive longer term value for our clients.At ADP, we remained steadfast in our commitment to lead in the HCM industry with best-in-class technology and service. At our February, Innovation Day we shared an update with many of you about the innovation we are driving across our key strategic and next gen solutions. The HCM industry is an exciting place with constant change and we will continue to invest to position ourselves to meet the evolving needs of our clients over not just the coming years but the coming decade.At Innovation Day, we've covered several topics and I'd like to reframe a few of our key products against today's backdrop. With ADP RUN we help small businesses manage their essential HR tasks from basic payroll to a full HCM suite. We highlighted our push-to-drive digital sales and onboarding capabilities1 which is especially relevant in today's environment and we also highlighted innovations in automating service and implementation which relieves pressure on our service organization. We discussed Workforce Now and our public cloud native version that we are pairing with our next gen payroll engine, which utilizes a fully transparent policy-based model for improved implementation, maintenance and self service as well as continuous payroll calculations for clients looking for on-demand pay options.We also talked about Wisely and the ease of use and the financial tools that make an attractive \u2013attractive way to get paid. And just this month we made Wisely Direct available to our mid-market Workforce Now clients, which we believe will be beneficial to the many workers in our base that still get paid by a paper check. And of course we discussed our next gen HCM, which we believe represents a big step ahead of current offerings in the market and for which we remain excited about scaling and selling more broadly.Before I turn it over to Kathleen, I'd like to take a moment to once again thank our associates. This health crisis and the resulting economic fallout hasn't been easy on anyone, but our associates have really stepped up to ensure we continue to provide our clients with the support they need, and our clients and I appreciate it, Kathleen, I'll turn it over to you now. Kathleen Winters : Thank you, Carlos and good morning everyone. As Carlos mentioned, we were generally pleased with our execution in Q3 and our financial results were not significantly impacted by COVID-19, with the exception of New Business Bookings. We expect Q4, however, to be challenging on a few fronts. And I will cover this when I go through our guidance.This quarter\u2019s revenue growth of 6% reported and organic constant currency was in line with our expectations. Our adjusted EBIT margin was up 60 basis points compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, even though it included a $50 million cost of a global associate assistance payment related to COVID-19 which we disclosed in an 8-K several weeks ago. Excluding this, our margin performance was even further ahead of our expectations and continued to benefit from a combination of cost savings related to our transformation initiatives and operating efficiencies, as well as lower than expected incentive compensation expenses. These benefits were partially offset by growth in PEO zero-margin benefits pass-through expenses and amortization expense, as well as certain other expenses related to COVID-19. Our adjusted effective tax rate increased 30 basis points to 23.8% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $1.92 driven by revenue growth and margin expansion, as well as fewer shares outstanding compared to a year ago.Moving on to segment results. In our Employer Services Segment, revenues grew 3% reported and 4% organic constant currency, reflecting steady underlying performance with strong retention trends offset by continued FX pressure and a growing headwind from interest income. Interest income on client funds declined 5%, and average yield on client funds declined 20 basis points to 2% offsetting growth in average client funds balances of 4% to $31.3 billion. This growth in balances was driven by a combination of client growth, wage inflation and growth in our pays per control in the quarter, partially offset by lower SUI collections and the closure of our Netherlands money movement operation earlier this year. Our Employer Services same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. was 1.9% for the third quarter and I\u2019ll talk a bit more about the trends we\u2019re seeing in a moment. Employer Services margins increased 100 basis points in the quarter, ahead of expectations and driven by many of the same factors I mentioned earlier when discussing our consolidated results.Our PEO segment revenues grew 11% for the quarter to $1.2 billion, and average worksite employees grew 7% to $595,000 ahead of our expectations and driven by strong year-to-date new business bookings. We were pleased with this re-acceleration in our Worksite Employee growth in the third quarter and believe we would have been positioned for further acceleration exiting the year if not for COVID-19. Revenues excluding zero margin benefits pass-through grew 9% to $490 million and continue to include pressure from lower workers' compensation and SUI costs and related pricing. PEO margin expanded 10 basis points in the quarter in-line with our expectations.Let me now turn to our outlook for the remainder of the year. I'll start by discussing some of the specific macro driven factors that affect our financial performance. I'll caveat by saying that we're clearly operating in an evolving and uncertain situation and we're using data currently available to us to make reasonable assumptions on which we are basing our guidance.First out-of-business losses, we expect our retention to be impacted by elevated out-of-business losses in Q4 and although the federal government is providing stimulus to help companies continue operating, we're seeing clear strain on our client base and have observed certain leading indicators; such as companies going inactive and no running payroll, many of whom will restart their operations at some point, but some of whom we expect will not. Based on our experience with these leading indicators, we are building in an expectation for additional losses in our fourth quarter outlook and as a result we're lowering our full-year retention guidance to be down 30 basis points to 50 basis points despite running ahead of our expectations on a year-to-date basis.Next, pays per control. We exited March with negative pays per control growth and in April it deteriorated to a double-digit decline. We were assuming a 2% to 2.5% pays per control decline for the full year, which implies a mid-teens decline for Q4. As a reminder of how this affects us, we have varied contracts throughout our businesses that blend base fees and per employee fees and we also often utilize shared pricing and have certain annual revenues that are not as affected. As a result with our current mix of business, the direct revenue impact we expect to see is about 25 basis points in ES revenue growth for every 1% change in PPC. Some of our businesses are more sensitive to pays per control than others and so the precise neck that pays per control by business can drive the actual revenue impact higher or lower in any given period. This direct impact also doesn't include the impact from our volume based businesses like recruiting or payment cards.Finally, on client funds balances, through the combination of a challenging sales environment and anticipated increase in out of business losses, a decline in pays per control and potential decline in wages and hours worked we expect to see pressure in our balances in the near-term. Furthermore, the CARES Act has a provision that allows companies to defer the payment of the employer portion of payroll taxes, which represents less than 5% of our average client funds balance. But depending on the actual take rate of that provision, we could see further pressure on our balance growth. As a result of all these factors, we now expect 1% balance growth for the full year, which implies a low double-digit decline in the fourth quarter. To adjust the size of our client's fund investments to match expected changes in average client payroll and tax volumes.Beginning in March, we halted all new reinvestment of maturity in our client long and extended portfolios. And in April we took the additional step of selling approximately $1.2 billion of previously purchased securities in the client long and extended portfolios. This decision to suspend new purchases means our Q4 interest income forecast reflects a slightly greater skew to overnight rates than previously forecasted. Both the suspension of new purchases and the completed sale of securities is contemplated in our guidance. To be clear, these decisions represent tactical adjustments and do not represent a change to our overall client funds strategy.Let's now turn to our revised outlook for the full year and start with the ES segments. We are lowering our guidance to 1% to 2% revenue growth versus our prior outlook of 4%, driven mainly by an expectation of lower paid per control, new business booking, client fund interest and retention versus our prior outlook. Much of this lost revenue comes at high incremental margins and as a result and also due to additional costs related to COVID-19 we now expect our margin in the employer services segment to be down 25 to up 25 basis points.For our PEO, we saw good momentum up through the end of March and as I mentioned earlier, we believe we were on track for continued acceleration exiting the year, but are now layering in our expectation for layoffs and furloughs and additional out of business losses. As a reminder in our PEO segment, we earn revenues as a percent of the gross payroll we process and as a result we are more directly tied to changes in our client's head count and hours worked as compared to our employer services segment. As a result of these assumptions and our expectations for lower Q4 PEO sales, we are lowering our average work site employee growth expectations to 3% to 5% from 7% to 8% previously. We are likewise lowering our revenue guidance and now expect 5% to 7% PEO revenue growth in fiscal 2020 and 3% to 5% growth in PEO revenues excluding zero margin benefits pass-through.As we also discussed throughout the year, we continue to expect lower workers' compensation and SUI costs and related pricing to pressure our total PEO revenue growth. Though we could see those trends change in the coming years. For PEO margin, we now expect to be down 100 basis points to 125 basis points in fiscal 2020. As we noted in previous calls, this outlook continues include pressure from smaller favorable reserve adjustment that ADP Indemnity in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, but we now expect about 75 basis points of pressure compared to our previous expectation of 50 basis points of pressure. So we still expect a slight benefit this year.With these changes to the segment, we now anticipate total revenue growth of about 3% in fiscal 2020 as compared to our previous outlook of 6%. This revenue outlook continues to assume slight FX unfavorability for fiscal 2020. As I mentioned, we anticipate our growth in average client funds balances to be about 1% compared to our previous outlook of 4% and we expect the average yield earn on our client funds investments to be about 2.1% compared to our previous outlook of 2.2%. We expect interest income on client funds to be $540 million to $550 million and for interest income from our extended investment strategy to be $550 million to $560 million.We anticipate our adjusted EBIT margin to be down 25 to up 25 basis points, as the benefits from our workforce optimization and procurement transformation initiatives are now being offset by the impact of expected loss of revenue due to COVID-19 as well as incremental expenses related to COVID-19 including the [$50] [ph million in global associate assistance payments.We now anticipate our adjusted effective tax rate to be 22.9%. The rate includes this quarters unplanned tax benefit from stock based compensation related to stock option exercises. It does not include any further estimated tax benefits related to potential future stock option exercises. As a result of our lower revenue and margin outlook, we now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to grow 4% to 7% in fiscal 2020. In light of this revised 2020 guidance and multiple headwinds created by the global pandemic and the uncertain and evolving situation we are withdrawing the fiscal 2021 targets that we set out at our 2018 Investor Day as they are no longer appropriate to the current circumstances. However, we continue to believe in our long-term strategy and well positioned to continue to invest to execute this strategy.Finally, before I conclude, I'd like to talk about the strength of ADP\u2019s business model and balance sheet. We have a highly cash generative business with low capital and the HCM Solutions we provide give critical support to our clients, HR and management functions, especially at times like these. In addition to having a resilient product and business model we also have a significant buffer between our free cash flow and our modest debt obligations and our cash to spend, this enables us to absorb the impact of downturns and continue to prioritize investments aligned with our longer term strategy as well as our commitments to shareholder friendly actions.So although our revenue growth can clearly be impacted by challenging macro conditions, our recurring revenue model and high retention rate positions us to continue the type of investments we highlighted at our innovation day even when times are tough. We will meanwhile continue to manage our cost base prudently. We have instituted hiring containment and started to execute on our recession playbook with a preplanned set of areas where we will see some of our expenses self-adjust, such as management and sales incentives and we will eliminate or defer non-essential staff. We're working through an evolving and uncertain situation and are formulating our approach for next year and we will of course provide you with our expectations and outlook for fiscal 2021 when we report our fourth quarter results. As always, expect us to be balanced in our approach.With that, I will pass it back to Carlos for some comments before we go to Q&A. Carlos Rodriguez : Thanks, Kathleen. Before we move on to the Q&A, I just wanted to share with you an excerpt of one of the many notes we received from our clients that that captures how we want to define ourselves. This one said, we are a small business that has used ADP for quite a few years now, every time we call there has been a knowledgeable professional at ADP that immediately solves the problem and answers the question.We recently needed payroll data to apply for the COVID-19 payroll protection program. I immediately went to ADPs website to see how I should go about selecting and downloading the required payroll data. Imagine the relief when opening the screen there was a COVID-19 pop-up that proactively provided your clients with the payroll data needed, I was floored. This type of customer service is unheard of these days. We just want to tip our hats to everyone ADP for a great job. As this client suggests, the value of a true HCM partner becomes even more critical at times like these. And it continues to be our goal to exceed the expectations of our clients.And with that I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Please go ahead. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. I hope you both are doing well. I wanted to ask about your visibility on the paycheck protection loan program in terms of, can you see that it's having the desired impact on businesses in the country? Are you seeing [indiscernible] terminated workers that are being brought back on book? And I guess just tying that back to your own performance or potential future performance, are you seeing the leading indicators of bankruptcy sort of staved-off a little bit in your book? Carlos Rodriguez : Great question, we're obviously keeping our eye on that. Unfortunately what we have is really kind of limited anecdotal evidence that people are beginning to get money to be able to continue their payroll, they continue to pay people. As an example, a few days ago I was forwarded a letter that was sent to \u2013 an email that was sent to one of our associates from a client that was grateful for kind of the help that we gave them in applying for the loan and they sent a kind of a screenshot of their bank account that had $10 the previous day and then now had $84,000, like indicating that they have gotten their money from the SBA deposited into their commercial bank account. But I think as you've heard same as us in the press, the process has been given the magnitude of the scale of the challenge it's been a difficult process both for the SBA and I think for the banks, we've tried to do our part to help and we're optimistic and we're hopeful that it will make a difference and that there will be rehiring and that it will at least in some respects stop the furloughing and the elimination of jobs going forward. But unfortunately it's just a little too early for us to give you any kind of concrete evidence other than some anecdotal stories that money is making its way into the bank accounts of small businesses. Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. Yes, that's helpful. Thank you. And then just a follow-up. In terms of your overall product strategy in the context of this crisis, are there any kind of adjustments you're having to make in terms of how you're thinking of new challenge, employees work from home, [indiscernible] time and attendance offering and also just on some of your major initiatives like Lifion? How\u2019s the timeline, the market being impacted, how are you thinking about the product set sort of evolving from here on out? Carlos Rodriguez : I mean, clearly we have to be nimble, and I think remain open to making further adjustments, but I think it's safe to say that if you go back over the course of decades, the concept of \u201coutsourcing\u201d and now what some people would call the SaaS models, which I think ADP was kind of one of the pioneers of, I think by definition, lend themselves to these kinds of remote work environments, whether it's for the technology people, because we generally obviously host and maintain and update the \u2013 all of the systems for our clients. But also through the variety of portals we have for our clients and the employees of our clients. All of the information that anyone needs is available online through all the tools we have to access that information, whether it's for the payroll practitioners or for the employees of our clients. Including, when you think about the app that we have for the employees of our clients to be able to check whether they've gotten paid, they can check their hours; they can make changes to 401(k). There's no really no need to move paper or for anyone to be in the office to do that kind of work. So clearly there will be things that we will learn and we'll probably hear in the early innings of this kind of new talent and how it might affect our products. But I think in general as an industry, it's not just for ADP, I think in general for us as an industry we're pretty well positioned I think for this kind of work environment. Kathleen Winters : And I think if I could just, yes, if I could just add to that. I think you had asked about, I couldn't quite hear, but I think you had asked about Lifion and any updates to that and changes to our view on go-to-market. I would say over the longer term, while certainly this year looks like things have slowed down at least for a little bit, I'd say over the long-term, no change to how we're thinking about that. And we're got a handful of live clients. We're continuing to sell clients on and implement clients on Lifion, and we're encouraged about the long-term prospects there. Carlos Rodriguez : Yes. It's clear, like every time that we have, whether it's an economic downturn or now this is obviously a new challenge, there's always questions about, will this drive greater adoption? I think intellectually it makes sense that this would drive greater outsourcing and greater adoption of a SaaS, but it's kind of hard to make that statement kind of where we are today, but theoretically and intellectually two or three years from now, there should be more demand and more people using SaaS solutions than there are today. Ramsey El-Assal: That makes a lot of sense. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Tien-Tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Tien- Tsin Huang : Hi, thanks so much. Appreciate the extent of disclosure here. Just on the \u2013 some of the follow-up to Ramsey's question, just on the sales performance side, you mentioned productivity challenges in addition to the demand factors. What would you think you'll get your productivity back on track and align your sales to where you see the puck going next in terms of demand as it evolved? Carlos Rodriguez : So we're trying to actually keep an eye on it week-to-week to get some sense of what levers there are still there. We clearly still have, our sales force is still selling and they're selling a lot of business, but at lower level than obviously we had expected and in lower levels and you compare it to the previous year. So unfortunately given the nature of the situation, it's kind of difficult to give you a kind of scientific or concrete answer. I think as we generate more information, I think probably for our guidance for next fiscal year, we'll be able to \u2013 I know that's not helpful to you today, but it's really a very difficult thing to talk about.We have a lot of, our salesforce was already what we call an inside salesforce and so we've proven that we can sell through insight selling, but we have some products that are what I would call high involvement decision sales. And it doesn't mean that those can't be done remotely. But it hasn't been the norm. So when you sell a very large complicated multinational solution, or frankly, even when you sell the PEO, historically there's been a relationship that's built there and a trust that gets built before that transaction gets consummated.So it clearly, this is \u2013 these are new and different times. So I don't think everyone is going to sit and wait around for everything to go back to normal before making decisions. But I think it's safe to assume, I think common sense would tell us that it's safe to assume that, there will be some level of hesitation and pull back in terms of decision making. Even though a good percentage of our salesforce is still outselling as they have before, although they're doing it virtually now. Tien- Tsin Huang : Yes. Sure. So we'll check in with you on that again next quarter. So then my quick follow-up, both of you have talked about cost initiatives. You guys did much better than we thought on the margin side even with the [$50] [ph] million. But you've also both hinted at a pipeline of more cost take out, potentially pre the pandemic. So I'm curious, your willingness to pull incremental expense leavers maybe some chunkier stuff, is that available to you and are you willing to do that at this stage? Carlos Rodriguez : So we did have a number of transformation initiatives underway. A lot of them were really around digital transformation efforts to kind of automate and improve the way our implementation or our services is delivered, which would create a better experience for our clients, the employees of our clients, frankly also for our associates that we thought would result in lower costs going forward. Yes, part of the challenge we have is as and again, every company may be different in terms of how they approach their level of support for their clients, but based on our model and the way we see ourselves playing a role, and frankly in society and with our clients, we've actually experienced quite an increase in volume and cost in the short-term.And so as an example, as the government rolled out the payroll protection program, we saw 40% to 50% spikes in inquiries right through whether it's phone or chat or by or by email. And so we had to work people overtime. We had to work people on weekends, which we're very grateful that people were willing to do, because you can imagine they've got lots of other concerns and distractions as this is all going on. And so we made a commitment that we're going to deliver to our clients through this and help them work through it, whether it's for themselves or for their employees. And unfortunately, I would say in the short-term, we actually have an increase in cost.Now, realistically that's not going to continue indefinitely. But every week that we said we think our call volumes and our workloads are going to go down, there's a new government program or a change in the government program, which by the way we think is great. I think that the efforts by the Fed and by policy makers, I think to help clients and their employees, I think is the right thing to do and we're very supportive. But as an example, there was just, as you know, there was an approval of an additional amount for the payroll protection program, which generates additional volume for us. By the way, I think the banks are in the same \u2013 probably in the same situation in terms of how having to handle kind of increase the volumes. And so we expect these levels to normalize and then to be in a position where we can reevaluate our cost structure, but again, given the timing of this call and where we are today, we really can't tell you that there has been a meaningful decline in our workloads. In fact, it's actually been an increase. Tien- Tsin Huang : Got it. I appreciate the work behind... Kathleen Winters : So, Tien-Tsin if I could just \u2013 let me just add a little bit more to that because I made some comments on our transformation efforts and transformation work even with the significant increase in service demand. So, even with this kind of very abrupt disruption and need to move our entire \u2013 practically our entire workforce to work from home. We will able to do that almost seamlessly. I mean, that worked really well through the huge, huge efforts of many of the different parts of the organization, from our technology groups to our HR to legal. I mean, it was a huge effort, but it worked well and so that we've been able to continue our normal processes, if you will around transformation work. There were certainly some projects that we have to look at and assess and say, okay, because of the big service demands we may need to slow down these.But our process in terms of tracking progress, continuing to execute, adjusting as necessary based on service demands and importantly continuing to look at pipeline of projects, that continue and I would just add one further comment that in particular in this environment, the ability to look at procurement and find procurement opportunities is potentially even greater today than it was, say three or four months ago. Carlos Rodriguez : I think if I can just one more just comment, I think that the \u2013 the part of the challenge here is that we are \u2013 the nature of our company and our business and our Board is to not focus on one month or one quarter. And I think when you look at we're able to deliver just in this quarter in terms of margin improvement and we've been able to do in the last couple of years, I think demonstrates very clearly our ability to, I think achieve and take advantage of operating leverage and also to manage our cost very effectively.We've had a couple of years with a very modest, if any cost \u2013 true cost increases while revenues were growing at what for us is our very healthy rates. So I think we've demonstrated what we can, what we can do, but unfortunately we've been handed a very abrupt change here in the environment and we're going to handle it first to take care of our associates, next take care of our clients. And I think when we get through this transitory period, which we all know is transitory, now we don't know is a transitory for a month or two or is it transitory for six months. But either way it's not multiple years and we want to make sure that we continue to invest in our business, take care of our people and take care of our clients that when we come out of this, we come out of it as strong as we were before we went into it. Tien- Tsin Huang : Yes. Very clear. It\u2019s just the case. Thank you. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thank you and thanks for the guidance and obviously the tough environment. Any thoughts on, one question we get a lot is how much of the layoffs are going to be furlough versus structural? So just any sense within kind of the pace for control, how much of that would be potentially furloughed workers versus structural? Maybe start there? Carlos Rodriguez : It's a great, question. So we have, as you know we operate in multiple countries and offer multiple segments; small business, midsize national accounts, but also in many countries and also multinational companies. And the policies that companies have around how they treat employees is going to vary from company-to-company and generally also varies from segment-to-segment. But what we can tell you is that, the way we count pays per control is very straightforward. It's whether or not someone got paid during that period of time that we're counting. And so we would not probably be able to give you a firm number of how many people are furloughed versus how many people are laid-off because we don't control necessarily that coding in the system. And clients can exercise some discretion about how they, I guess tagged some of their employees.But what we do know is that if somebody doesn't get paid, they don't get counted in pays for control. And if they do get paid, even if it's at a reduced wage, that does count and so that creates a number of challenges obviously. Because you could have reduced wage levels, which then doesn't negatively impact pays per control, but impacts the employees themselves. And may in some cases, impact our fees generally wouldn't other than in the PEO, but could impact our fees as well.So I would say that the best thing to do is to stick to \u2013 trying to use the pays per control metric as a way of building your models and using the guidance that we provided around 25 basis points of revenue growth, impact from each 1% change in pays per control. I think that gives you a very \u2013 we spent a lot of time pressure testing that assumption. I think Danny did a lot of work on it and I think that's a pretty solid way for you to look at things. So when you hear guidance from us about pays per control and you use that metric for your model, I think that's a much cleaner and easier way than to try to separate how many are furloughs versus how many are layoffs, et cetera, et cetera. Kevin McVeigh : That's super helpful. And then I guess just a quick follow-up would be kind of coming out of this, obviously, in these type of events; you're really turn to in terms of the cavalry of the organization. Do you see any change competitively, particularly as obviously coming out of the last cycle much more service oriented as opposed to shift to the cloud in this one, but from a competitive perspective, any changes where you look to even build on that attrition number, longer term in terms of improvement? Carlos Rodriguez : I think you do see some subtle differences in terms of company cultures and I think behavior. So as an example, one of the things that we have always, I think, trying to talk about is this willingness by us to really help our clients navigate through things, not just provide them the software solution. We actually took some responsibility for the outcomes of what they're trying to accomplish. And so the support we're providing around all these regulatory, I think is an example of that. That doesn't mean that other competitors aren't doing similar things.But as an example, some competitors would be more along the lines of providing tools online and directing clients to third parties or directing them to resources where they could get help versus in our case, we actually take the work on and we help our clients get to where they need to get in order to get their retention credit, tax credit, in order to get their payroll protection loan, in order to calculate in a few weeks or at least in a couple of months people are going to be needing help with calculating how to get forgiveness on those loans. I mean, there \u2013 this is a complicated environment by the way employment in general is always complicated. But this is a very complicated environment and having great tools and technology is incredibly important and we're totally committed to that. But I think it's undeniable that you also need extra help in these situations to help with questions and to help you navigate through the all the various regulatory hurdles.As an example, some of the legislation that was passed in the U.S., you have to really understand the interplay like, as an example, you can't take advantage of the deferral social security taxes and the payroll protection loans, but if you \u2013 you can take advantage of the social security deferrals up until you can get a loan, but then once it's forgiven, you can no longer defer your social security taxes. I mean those are things that are typically not well understood by our client base and I think just directing them to a website or to a tool, we don't think is really the \u2013 is the best way to help them. Kevin McVeigh : That's awesome. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Your line is open. Bryan Bergin : Hi, good morning. Thank you. Hope your families are all well. I wanted to try on outlook here. Just understanding the material uncertainty, can you help us frame some initial fiscal 2021 guide posts in trying to think how we should be thinking about next year based on some of the implied 4Q run rates? So, any sense of visibility you have across the businesses or maybe thinking across client size would be helpful. Thanks. Carlos Rodriguez : First of all, thanks for asking about our families. I hope yours is well also. Unfortunately, I mean it's a very fair question and I can understand why you're looking for any additional color. It's \u2013 as you can imagine, we struggled with even providing kind of fourth quarter metrics, because, two, three, four weeks ago, we had \u2013 or people had a certain view of how long \u201cthe issue is going to continue\u201d and when things were going to open up again. And then it got more negative and now it feels like it's gotten more positive. So I think that it's very difficult for us to go really beyond the fourth quarter in this environment.We have to remain optimistic that things are going to \u201cimprove\u201d but I think that we all have to take advantage of the time we have to wait and see how things play out, whether it's with the clients or with GDP or with the economy, or with these government programs, so that we can make more informed, I think, decisions about what 2021, I think, might look like. So I apologize for not being able to give you any additional color. But I think it would be a mistake to assume that the levels of activity that we've given you in the fourth quarter will continue into 2021, but it's also a mistake to assume that things are going to go back to normal at the beginning of 2021. And so we're going to keep an eye on the data and the information and do our best as we gather more information to give you a good view of what's going to happen in 2021 when we get there. Kathleen Winters : Yes, maybe I could just add a few comments around the process and what we're doing in the data that we're looking at. Hence, while as Carlos said, we can't really give you the view right now or the exact guidepost, at least if you'll understand and know the process we're going that might help a little bit. So, look, things are, as Carlos said, it's extremely fluid right now. We're spending a lot of time studying and watching developments every single day and kind of looking at, I think about it in three steps if you will, in terms of first understanding what's happening from a pandemic standpoint and the epidemiology. Then understanding how that impacts the economy broadly around the world and then understanding how that impacts each of the business. So as we do that, obviously we're looking at numerous forecasts that I'm sure you all are looking at the same forecast that are being put out.But we're really spending a lot of time in parsing through those and kind of eliminating outliers and really utilizing the ones that we feel makes the most sense, and then applying that to you know, as I said, the implications for our business units and when you do that, as we've said largely PPC is going to be extremely significant driver for us. And then certainly the shape of the recovery from a new business booking standpoint will be critically important, so we're watching that as well as we see different regions and states kind of formulating and attempting the return to work. Bryan Bergin : Okay. I appreciate that. Wanted on retention, the comments on the assumptions in 4Q, is the reduction wholly due to business closures. I'm curious if you're seeing any change in the competitive client loss. Carlos Rodriguez : Well, I think based on the comments we gave you about the third quarter and the year-to-date, I think we're doing pretty well competitively, because I think our retention was up. I mean we don't talk about quarterly retention, but why not like everything's out the window in this kind of environment. But I think we were over 50 basis points improvement in the third quarter and through the year-to-date. I think we were well ahead of both the guidance, we had provided in our own internal expectations. So it's pretty clear that we were doing something right competitively.Our NPS scores are at record levels across most of our businesses. So again, the problem is this is not the time to brag and talk about the third quarter, but we really had incredible momentum coming into the third quarter on a number of fronts, but that's that and we're onto now figuring out how to deal with the future challenges, but I have no concerns about the solidity of our business on every front coming into the third quarter. Bryan Bergin : Thank you. Be well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Kartik Mehta : Hi, good morning, Carlos. I was wondering, based on the data you're seeing and I realize this is so early in, but what kind of changes do you anticipate for the business, permanent changes or at least over the next 12 months to 18 months because of this current crisis? Carlos Rodriguez : Well, over the next 12 months to 18 months is probably the right focus, because I mean, I think it'd be naive to think there aren't some things are going to change permanently, but I'm not sure I have that, that kind of crystal ball to be precise about that. But for the next 12 months to 18 months, because of the focus we have on our associates, it's unlikely that we will be going back to business as usual here in the next few months.Now the good news is we've adapted to the current work environment. So, but \u2013 I kind of concrete change in terms of the next 12 months, 18 months is we don't anticipate having a 100% of our workforce back working in these one locations and some of these other places where we have large populations of associates. And so that's a change that we have to make sure that we stay on top of, that we support our people and lead them remotely and virtually and help them kind of navigate through what's a very different way of working.Now obviously we plan on, as society kind of normalizes, we plan on coming along for the ride with us. So we do a lot of formulating plans as we speak, very preliminary plans around how do we slowly get back into some of our offices with limited number of personnel, but that's a change that we're definitely going to have to continue to live with for the next 12 months to 18 months. Now, what that means is that impacts our salesforce and so the question is, if the demand equation improves significantly and our salesforce is still working remotely, how can we make sure that they have the right tools and the right processes to continue to take advantage of the demand that's out there.Because we don't anticipate having large numbers of salespeople back in our offices, our salespeople, by definition, many of them are inside sales, but many of them are out in face-to-face transactions. And that's not something that's going to normalize in the next 12 months to 18 months. Sadly, I'm sad to report that of the number of associates that we had impacted by COVID-19, we were disproportionately impacted in our salesforce. So as we go back to normalization, we're going to be exceptionally careful about protecting our salesforce as well. Kartik Mehta : And then just finally, Carlos, what do you think the recovery will look like, we've heard so much a V, a U, a L, I'm just interested in your perspective of what you're anticipating from a recovery? Carlos Rodriguez : Well I think the \u2013 again, we're looking at, we get information from all of the usual places like Morgan Stanley is obviously our banks, so they've been very helpful in getting us their information, but we have access to information from a number of other sources. I don't want to say any of the names, so I don't hurt anybody's feelings, but all the usual banks we get the information from them. We have information from Moody's, by the way we also work with the fed. We work with treasury. We have a lot of sources of information to give us some sense of kind of where things are headed.The challenges that I don't think anyone has really well \u2013 I don't think, I know that no one has ever been through this. So there really aren't any great models other than using inputs like PMIs or consumer confidence and other metrics that tend to be many of the metrics that people use in these models are lagging indicators.And you have regression that gives you some sense of where the economy is headed. But, as I\u2019ve seen myself in the last four to five weeks, you have to take any forecasts with a large grain of salt. So the best approach we think you can have right now is to remain flexible and agile about how you're planning and what you're planning for. If I were \u2013 if we had to make a bet today, we would say that, it's not going to be a V-shaped recovery and it's probably not going to be a U or an L, but it's going to be some other kind of shape where we obviously already had the precipitous decline. We\u2019ve already seen some signs of some stabilization. So we have metrics that we track like in our HR systems of our clients.For example, new job postings or number of screenings that are done, like background checks and some of those metrics have actually begun to stabilize. So I think we've had the abrupt drop. Now the question is the recovery, it feels like that recovery will be not a V, but not an L. And so the difference between V and L is a check Mark. Like I think some people are out there quoting, by the way we have an economist on our board and he referred to as a Nike Swoosh, but that's probably a copyright or trademark violation. So I won't use the Nike Swoosh, but you get the idea of rough drop and hopefully a climb back up over some period of time. Hopefully that client is over the course of three to six months and not over the course of 12 months to 18 months. Kartik Mehta : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is open. David Grossman : Alright, thank you. Good morning. Carlos, I think you've addressed this in a couple of previous questions, but based on how this may play out coming out of the crisis and you talked just a moment ago about some possible structural changes at least in the intermediate term being work from home or virtual sales. How do you feel the way you're positioned, coming out of that versus where you were going into it and how do you view your ability to leverage that to your advantage? Is it structural or is it based on execution, I'm sure it's a combination of both, but if you could just give us a little more insight into how you're feeling about, what you can do with this crisis to really enhance your position both competitively and operationally. Carlos Rodriguez : Well, look I think that some of this is philosophical. I think that I like everyone else when we were entering this space I was scared like everyone else's, not just personally for myself and my family, but also for the company and all of our associates and our clients that depend on us.And when you see the reaction and the ability of the organization to kind of get through it and not just get through it, but actually deliver a higher level of service and help with very complicated questions in a very complicated situation, which was changing in some cases on a daily basis with the regulatory landscape. I think it tells you something about the strength of the culture and of the company. And so that gives me, again, this is all intellectual philosophical, but I think it gives me great hope about how we emerge from this competitively.We already had incredibly strong momentum going in to the third quarter, as you saw from retention we think we have a strong product lineup that was beginning to get traction. One of the things we didn't talk about when someone asked the question about our competitive situation, like we had really good growth in client counts, particularly in Workforce Now and specifically in our mid-market business. So the combination of positive momentum and coming into this and then the reaction and the strength of the organization through this gives me great optimism and hope that we're going to come out of this stronger than any of our competitors. Kathleen Winters : Yes. Let me just add to that \u2013 Yes, I would just add to that, in addition to the great service that we've been able to provide to our clients throughout this, which theoretically ideally should sustain or drive even better retention going-forward. I would say the strength of our balance sheet and the ability to continue to invest aligned with what we laid out at our Innovation Day for investing in our strategic products and Workforce Now and RUN and our next gen product, our ability to continue to do that throughout this should position us well. David Grossman : Okay. That's it for me. Thanks very much. And be well. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Wald with Morgan Stanley, your line is open. Steven Wald : Yes. Good morning. I hope you guys are safe and well, and thanks for the shout out from Morgan Stanley, a little bit around that subject. Maybe just starting off on some of the puts and takes of the segments, that you guys pointed to work site employee growth, still NPO versus lower pays per control and Employer Services just maybe run us through again because it's come up a lot in recent conversations around why the PEO should still be thought of as a employment-wise a little bit more defensive and how you guys see that tracking this downturn versus prior ones. Carlos Rodriguez : I think the number one reason is really just structural in the sense that when you look at overall ADP, we have clients all the way from a single employee all the way to very large national accounts. And so as we've said \u2013 we said this obviously over multiple decades, our down market business tends to be the most sensitive to other business but also to decreases in pays per control. And so as we track this pays per control data, I think we've probably given you some of the color that the pays per control numbers are down more in the down market than they are in the mid and the up market.The PEO, at least in our case, the PEO tends to \u2013 the average sized client, just from a practical standpoint is 45 and we tend to \u2013 we try to stay away from clients that are under 10 employees. We have some clients obviously that are between five and 10 employees, but in general, the sweet spot of the PEO is kind of around 45, that's the average. And so it's just the nature of the structural difference of that business versus the others that the pays per control is not going to decline as much as the overall average, if you will, where you have some of that average being in the small business and in the small business market.And then the second more anecdotal comment would be the PEO clients. Our PEO clients, not every PEO clients, our PEO clients tend to provide health benefits or retirement plan, they tend to be kind of higher average wages in the average U.S. worker. And that makes sense because you're paying for the help that you get with maximizing and managing that Salesforce. So it tends to be attractive to a higher average wage employer that is very concerned with attracting the right people and retaining the right people. So that also tends to lead you in the direction of clients that are a little bit larger, maybe a little bit more financially capable of paying those fees, et cetera. So that \u2013 but that not \u2013 not sure that we can have a scientific way of proving that one, but for sure the average size client of a PEO, our PEO is larger than in our SBS business and hence the pays per control drop would logically be smaller. Steven Wald : Got it. That's very helpful color. In terms of just a quick follow-up on capital management dividend, I know, both of you have mentioned the strength of the balance sheet, continued ongoing investment and cost cutting. But in terms of how we should think about things like the dividend and the safety there or your willingness to raise that, given the current environment or buybacks and other forms of acquisition that lower valuations, how are you guys thinking about that from a financial but also a strategic and sort of, I guess sensitivity to the times type of perspective. Carlos Rodriguez : Okay. So I'm glad you asked that question, as I happened to talk to our Chairman yesterday, before this call because I figured somebody might ask that question. It's a tricky question because as you know, it's up to the board to decide on our dividend, but I can tell you this, that we had a board meeting on April 8, and the board approved an increase and a payment of our dividend. And they wouldn't have done that if they had concerns in the short or medium-term about our capital position or about our dividends.So again, without speaking for the board, I think we have a very long 45 year track record of paying and increasing our dividend. We have a strong balance sheet. We are a capital light business with strong cash generation. Our payout ratio is 55% to 60%, which I think gives us some room to be able to continue even with increases without running into any major capital constraints or restrictions on our investing. So I would feel optimistic that our board would be supportive of continuing the long track record. ADP has of 45 years as it stands. And I'll let Kathleen maybe make a comment or two about that as well. Kathleen Winters : Yes, thank you. You covered it really well for us, I would just say in support of enabling the board to make dividend decisions, we in a normal basis do ongoing analysis and stress testing and have been continuing to do that through this environment. So we've been doing, looking really closely at that stress testing. So, I really don't have anything to add beyond what Carlos commented. Steven Wald : Great. Thank you. Operator : We have time for one more question. And that's from the line of Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson your line is open. Lisa Ellis : Thank you. Thank you for squeezing me in and great to hear everybody's voices. Glad to hear you're well. Just a little bit of a follow-up on the PEO question. I mean, as you just highlighted the work site employees in PEO are a bit more resilient, because of the larger size of company, but the revenue guidance there is down more significantly in Q4, maybe like a tactical question just around what drives that in the short-term, but maybe a broader question, Carlos, for you coming from originally the PEO business, how should we think about how the PEO will act through a recession period? Do you expect increased demand for the PEO or some clients dropping out of the PEO? How do you think about that dynamic? Thank you. Carlos Rodriguez : Great question, I'll let Danny pull up the calculator too, because I'm sure you're right about the dropping greater, there\u2019s no intention, there's no signaling or anything intended there, maybe rounding or the math or something. But there's no magic formula there that we're trying to send some kind of message. I mean, we think the PEO business is solid and strong and I think tends to whether recession is better. Again, every time you have a recession, it's a different kind of recession. So we had a financial crisis last time, this time it's a health crisis. So I'm always cautious of making kind of bold definitive statements. But historically we've always worried about the PEO going into a recession or into a crisis being challenged, because it does tend to be a kind of a more expensive, if you will \u2013 solution, if you will, but it also provides an enrollment with higher amount of value, and during these types of situations, like for example, our PEO handles the questions not just of our clients, but of the employees of our clients.That's not what we generally do for our typical payroll. That helps our clients a lot and we leave them of a big burden and provide those employees a lot of confidences, a lot of real positives and good reasons why people want to stay on a PEO or why they want to be on a PEO even in a recessionary environment. So I would say that, in the prior recessions, the PEO was not immune, just like it's not this time from pays per control decreases and from some short-term disruptions with new bookings. But we've been impressed, I've been through now, I guess this is my third recession at ADP and at least the prior to the PEO performed on a relative basis as well, if not better than the rest of our business. And we would expect no different on a go forward basis. Danyal Hussain : And Lisa, this is Danny just to add, because it's fairly in the weeds, which I love of course, but in addition to the impact from work site employees in the PEO we charge as a percent of payroll and so wages themselves, to the extent we have some workers working fewer hours within the PEO base that can have an impact and then even further in the weeds is, you can have a slight mix impact with respect to workers' comp. To the extent that certain industries have greater impact from pays per control and those had higher workers comp rate. So these are very subtle impacts, but together they\u2019re kind of informed that guidance. Lisa Ellis : Wonderful. Thank you. And then maybe my last one and Carlos, could you one to end on, as you're watching and maybe help us a little bit, what are the top, like literally one or two things that you are watching that you think are really going to impact as you're looking at your client base, the shape of the swoosh or the check mark are over these next couple of months? Carlos Rodriguez : I think the first one that we're keeping our eye on is really these leading indicators, if you will. So this would be job postings and background checks. And so that I think is \u2013 those are I think the job postings is obvious in the sense that people aren't really going to post new positions if they think that things are not going to at some point improve. So to me, that's a sign that people are doing the same thing we're doing, which is we're conservative and we're cautious, but we have to be prepared for every eventuality in including the optimistic one.And so this increase in postings, job postings to me means that people are starting to think of, well, if in two, three, four weeks this state or this industry has some kind of opening, I need to make sure that I have the people available to handle that work, because these are business owners that obviously have to run their businesses.And then secondly, when they actually do that, then they actually have to put that person through the new hiring process which is the screening and selection. And so we're going to keep an eye on those two figures. Then closely behind that, I think is a \u2013 we have a very large workforce management business or some people would call time and attendance. And so that is also data that is very helpful in terms of seeing number of hours worked. It doesn\u2019t always help you a lot with an exempt workforce, but for people who are paid hourly, it's a very good indicator that kind of cuts through the noise of furloughs and layoffs and so forth and so on, just kind of gives you some sense of \u201chours worked and whether that is increasing or not increasing\u201d so that should show an upturn before we see upturns in other things, because people will take the existing people they have now and just have them work longer hours rather than adding additional people. So the addition of people will probably be the final I think sign of a of recovery, but we have a number of other indicators that we can look at that gives us an earlier view of where we're headed. Lisa Ellis : Wonderful, thanks guys. Operator : That concludes our question and answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos Rodriguez : So it's hard to kind of find the words to close the call out and describe the situation that we're in. But trying to end on an optimistic note here, I've been now with ADP 20 years. And I've been through, I just mentioned two recessions, this is my third, been through Y2K, which most of the people on the call don't even remember. Danny, certainly doesn't remember Y2K, he was too young, through 9/11, we'd been through wars, we've been through multiple changes in technology, nobody was even talking about SaaS when I joined ADP. And every time we had a challenge it looked like that was a challenge that we couldn't overcome.But every time ADP overcame that challenge and it's no different, I think for the rest of \u2013 in this case, humanity because this is affecting not just the U.S. but it's affecting the entire world. People in ADP find a way to evolve and to adapt. So I have to be optimistic, we have a propensity to overcome. If not, we wouldn't be here talking to you today, whether it's us as human beings or us as a company. By the way, as I've said multiple times in other calls, we're 70 years old and I think as a company, and I think that tells you something, we're a part of a very long history of overcoming challenges and this one is going to be no different.And I'll leave you with something that I shared with our associates at the beginning of the crisis, which is something that our Founder, Henry Taub, I think established as a culture for the company that I think is appropriate. And he always told us and he told me because I knew him personally, he told me always take care of your associates and they will take care of your clients and everything else will take care of itself.So I really appreciate the support of all of you for ADP. Thank you for calling in and asking your questions and my best wishes to all of you for health and safety for you and your families. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP\u2019s Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Danyal Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Danyal Hussain : Thank you, Crystal. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining ADP\u2019s fourth quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call and webcast. Participating today are Carlos Rodriguez, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Kathleen Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. The earnings materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com where you will also find the investor presentation that accompany today\u2019s call as well as our quarterly history of revenue and pre-tax earnings by reportable segment. During our call today, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these items, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measures, can be found in our earnings release. Today\u2019s call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. As always, please do not hesitate to reach out should you have any questions. And with that, let me now turn the call over to Carlos. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you, Dany and thank you everyone for joining the call. This morning, we reported our fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 results. Although we ended the year \u2013 this year against significant headwinds related to COVID-19, we believe we executed well over the course of the last 12 months. And our product offerings remain well positioned to support sustainable long-term revenue growth as we continue to help companies and their workforces through all types of environments. For the quarter, we delivered revenue of $3.4 billion, down 3% reported and 2% organic constant currency, which was better than our expectations. And for the full year, we delivered revenue of $14.6 billion, up 3% reported and 4% organic constant currency. Our adjusted EBIT margin increased 10 basis points in the quarter and increased 60 basis points for the full year, well ahead of our expectations as we managed our expense base prudently to absorb the impact of a decline in revenue in the fourth quarter, while simultaneously providing an elevated level of service to our clients. With this revenue and margin performance, our adjusted EPS growth was flat for the quarter and up 9% for the year. Considering the unprecedented and evolving macroeconomic situation, we are very pleased with our execution in the quarter and our current positioning as employment continues to gradually recover from the steep declines our clients have experienced. The global health crisis from COVID-19 has clearly evolved over these past few months. And I will start today\u2019s discussion by providing a brief update on the trends we have experienced. When we reported our fiscal third quarter results in April, we were just starting to see some preliminary signs of stabilization after weeks of rapid deterioration, more specifically, across our own data sources, including weekly payroll, clock-in volume, job postings and background screenings. There were multiple indications that we were reaching the trough. Now 3 months later, we do believe we saw conditions bottom in late April. Whereas our pays per control was trending down mid-teens in April, it has since improved to be down about 10% as we exited the quarter. And for the full quarter, pays per control was down 10.8% better than we had contemplated in our outlook. Last quarter, we also discussed our expectation for elevated out-of-business losses in May and June. Those losses ultimately developed in line with our expectations. This yielded a decline in our retention rate of 20 basis points to 90.5% for the full year. Though if not for the elevated out-of-business losses in Q4, we believe our retention rate would have been up for the year. In fact, despite these losses in Q4 for fiscal 2020, we tied an all-time high retention for our mid-market and hitting multi-year high in our up-market. Looking ahead, what we have been encouraged by signs that the economic distress brought about by COVID-19 has started to ease in certain countries and several U.S. states. We are seeing continued or even increasing distress in others. And over the past several weeks, we have seen the pace of employment recovery slow. Accordingly, as we set our expectations for the coming year, we believe that the worst is behind us. But the global economic recovery over the coming quarters will be gradual. Kathleen will discuss some of our specific macroeconomic assumptions in more detail. I\u2019d like to turn now to Employer Services new business bookings. We reported a decline of 21% for the year, which was in line with our revised outlook despite the limited visibility we had in making that forecast. And although this represents a significant decline, the actual execution by our sales force was better than what this reported growth rate suggests. As we mentioned last quarter, there are two components to our bookings figure. Our gross bookings we actually sold in the quarter and adjustments for previously required bookings. Our gross bookings sold in Q4, while down significantly, came in ahead of our forecast, and most importantly, exited the quarter with improving momentum. This gives us confidence that buying behavior is continuing to trend in the right direction, which we believe will drive further bookings recovery in the coming quarters. Furthermore, our sales force has continued to adapt to this virtual sales environment as we have invested in training, stayed agile on sales messaging, and continued to foster our channel relationships. We are also continuing to see week-on-week improvement in leading indicators, such as referrals, appointments per salesperson and demos scheduled. In addition to these gross bookings, we regularly adjust bookings we have previously recognized if for example, a client is no longer expected to start within the original estimated timeframe or starting with fewer employees than originally anticipated. These backlog adjustments are ordinarily immaterial to our bookings growth. But as we said last quarter, COVID-19 is causing some clients to delay implementations or to start with fewer employees than we originally signed. We made a larger backlog adjustment in Q4 than previously planned. And this offset the better underlying sales performance we experienced. Looking ahead, we expect we will likely see negative bookings growth in the first half of fiscal 2021 as we are still selling into an unfavorable macro environment. We expect growth to be flat to positive in Q3 with much more substantial growth in Q4 driving full year bookings growth of flat to up 10%. Beyond fiscal 2021, a key priority will be getting our sales productivity back to or above its previous level. Within our control are the investments we make. And in fiscal 2021, we are planning to continue investing in product innovation, digital sales capabilities and leading-edge sales tools to drive sales productivity higher. In addition, at this point, we are planning to add modestly to the size of our sales force. And together, we believe these investments will position us well to return to our previous \u2013 to our prior new business bookings growth trend line as client buying behavior continues to normalize. Factors beyond our control, including overall GDP trends, as well as the timing and scope of workers returning to their job sites, were in the meantime likely continue to impact our bookings. Moving on, service has remained critical to our clients. Our clients look to us for support and guidance in navigating through the complexities of key HR challenges and regulatory change. And our goal has been to serve as a trusted partner as they faced COVID-19. Our clients have responded very positively to the robust service we have provided. And that in turn has led to record NPS scores in June as a direct outcome of our commitment to providing a successful level of service. And we expect this favorable NPS trend to have positive implications for us in the years ahead. In response to the initial surge in service volumes related to COVID-19, we redeployed hundreds of sales and implementation associates to help meet the service need. While average resolution time spent per service requests remains elevated as our clients work through complex issues, we have now seen our service request volume return to more normal levels. And we are happy to report that we have now deployed most of these associates back to their sales and implementation rules. We continue to keep watch on proposed legislation that could drive another surge in client service demand and we remain prepared for such a scenario. We also continue to serve our clients through product innovation. During the quarter, we rolled out a range of solutions to help our clients through the crisis and prepare for the recovery. We implemented over 1,000 feature changes in response to 2,000 legislative updates in 60 countries. And we also had over 400,000 clients run over 2 million Paycheck Protection Program reports for a total loan volume of approximately $115 billion. Many of those clients have also now run the necessary reports to apply for their loans to be forgiven. Looking ahead, a key product focus is enabling safe return to the workplace. And we are offering tools, including touchless and voice-enabled clocking, health attestation and enhanced scheduling and analytics to help clients manage their workforces as they resume workplace operations. We continually progress on our other major product initiatives, including the rollout of our next-gen HCM platform and payroll engines. 2 weeks ago, we won yet another award for our next-gen HCM solution, the Ventana Annual Digital Innovation award. And we remain excited about its rollout. Perhaps more importantly, despite shifting our workforce to remote environment, we remain on track to hit our R&D development roadmap milestones. And just this quarter, we piloted next-gen HCM and payroll in Australia. Our product team also launched our new workforce management solution in the down-market, like a new time kiosk in the Apple App Store. And we went general availability with Wisely Direct in our mid-market and down-market. Now, taking a step back, I\u2019d like to say that in every challenge, there is a potential for upside and COVID-19 is no exception. We believe that the nature of this shock in which businesses of all sizes have faced major uncertainties in managing their employees, have made an HCM partnership they have with ADP got much more valuable. And as companies emerge from this crisis, we expect them to see even more clearly the benefits of investing in robust, secure HCM offerings that include expertise and service to support their mission-critical activities. So, although COVID-19 has created temporary headwinds in our growth, past experience has taught us to stand firm regarding our investments in strategy as part of our commitment to drive long-term sustainable growth. The strength of our business model and balance sheet allow us to do exactly that. And we are well-positioned in our product, service and go-to-market strategy. Last, before turning it over to Kathleen, I would like to quickly touch on our plans for our own associates. Last quarter, we discussed having over 98% of our workforce operating virtually, including our sales force and we have been pleased with that transition and their overall performance in this environment. While we are well-positioned to continue operating this way, we are in the early stages of bringing back a small portion of our workforce to the office on a volunteer-only basis. And I am actually pleased to join you today from our Roseland headquarters, which we opened just this Monday. Our sales force will continue to primarily engage with prospects and clients virtually, but they are beginning to conduct face-to-face meetings in some geographies, to the extent that they and our clients and prospects are ready to do so. And with all that said, I would like to once again take a moment to recognize our associates for their outstanding effort and the sacrifices they have made. I understand the monumental task of managing work and home life is a complex situation. And I also know it\u2019s not easy. A heartfelt thanks to our associates and leaders for their commitment. I will now turn it over to Kathleen. Kathleen Winters : Thank you, Carlos and good morning everyone. During the quarter, our revenues declined as we felt the full brunt of a double-digit decline in employment among our clients combined with other recession-driven headwinds. But we believe we executed well and are well-positioned to do so for the quarters ahead. For the fourth quarter, our revenue decline of 3% reported and 2% organic constant currency was ahead of our expectations as pays per control and PEO performance were better than we have planned. Our adjusted EBIT margin was up 10 basis points in the quarter also well ahead of our expectations. We took certain costs actions in the quarter continue to benefit from cost savings related to our ongoing transformation initiatives and also benefited from lower selling expenses, which together offset the margin impact from the loss of high margin revenues related to COVID-19. Our adjusted effective tax rate decreased 210 basis points to 22.9% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. And our adjusted diluted earnings per share was flat at $1.14 as lower year-over-year revenues were offset by modest margin expansion, a lower tax rate and a lower share count compared to a year ago. We ended fiscal 2020 with revenue growth of 3% reported and 4% organic constant currency. Adjusted EBIT margins up 60 basis points and adjusted EPS growth of 9%, all in a solid year, particularly given the significant decline in economic activity and employment that we faced over the last few months. As I move on to ES segment results, it\u2019s important to emphasize how resilient the business performance was in the context of unprecedented headwinds, including a 10.8% decline in pays per control and a 22% drop in client funds interest revenue. During the quarter, our Employer Services revenue declined 6% on a reported basis and 5% on an organic constant currency basis in line with our expectations as better underlying growth was offset by incremental FX drag. Our client fund balance declined 8% in the fourth quarter, reflecting lower pays per control, lower state unemployment insurance rates, payroll tax deferrals amongst some of our clients, and the continued lapping of the closure of our Netherlands money movement operation in October of 2019. Combining that balance decline with a 30 basis point decline in average yields drove our client funds revenue to decline by 22% to $115 million. For the full year, our ES revenue was up 1% reported and 2% organic constant currency, a solid performance. Employer Services margins were flat for the quarter, well ahead as our most recent expectations. We had the impact of lower revenues at relatively high incremental margins as we discussed last quarter offset by prudent cost control measures across all categories. ES margins were up 60 basis points for the full year. Moving on to PEO, also solid performance given the circumstances. Our total PEO segment revenues increased nearly 4% for the quarter to $1.1 billion and average worksite employees declined 3% to $548,000. This revenue and worksite employee growth, were both ahead of our expectations driven by better retention performance and pass-through revenue. Same-store employment at our PEO clients performed in line with our expectations of a mid single-digit decline and as expected was more resilient than the average client in our ES segment. Revenues, excluding zero margin benefits pass-throughs, declined 5%. And in addition to being driven by lower worksite employees, it continued to include pressure from lower workers\u2019 compensation and SUI costs and related pricing. PEO margin declined 450 basis points in the quarter. This included about 530 basis points of unfavorability from the net expense in ADP indemnity of approximately $34 million, which contrasts to the $22 million benefit we had in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. As a reminder, we had experienced favorable worker\u2019s comp claim trends over the past several years which translated to favorable reserve adjustments in ADP indemnity. Those trends remain positive, but not as much as what we factor in our most recent reinsurance agreements. And as a result, we had a slight true-up the other way this year. Let me turn now to our outlook for fiscal 2021. I will start by discussing some of the specific U.S. macro driven assumptions that underpin our guidance. The data for these assumptions is a combination of our own trend data and third-party macroeconomic forecast and we believe we are utilizing a balanced outlook. First, our pays per control outlook. We are assuming a decline in average pays per control of 3% to 4% for the year, driven by decline in the high single-digit range for the first half of the year, improving to a decline of mid single-digit by Q3, followed by a rebound to positive mid to high single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. This outlook corresponds to a gradual improvement in the employment picture through the fiscal year though it did not contemplate a full employment recovery. To help translate this trend into a single number you can anchor to, our guidance contemplates the U.S. getting to approximately 7% unemployment by June of 2021. Second, out-of-business losses. Our retention was negatively impacted by losses in its most recent quarter, as we had a number of clients turn inactive, but after monitoring and assessing, we decided to write-off as losses. While we believe government stimulus programs have helped many small businesses, we continue to see some companies in an inactive state where they are not paying employees. And we expect continued elevated losses in the early part of fiscal 2021 as restrictions and lower demand in certain industries continue to drive fall out. As a result, we are setting our expectation for ES retention to decline by another 50 to 100 basis points over this coming fiscal year. Lastly, on client fund interest. As discussed last quarter, our client balance growth is being impacted by the combination of a decline in pays per control, lower new business bookings and out-of-business losses and we had some modest pressure from companies taking advantage of the payroll tax deferral provision of the CARES Act. We are assuming a client funds balance of 6% to 8% for the year. And like pays per control, we expect it to be negative for the first three quarters and then return to growth in Q4. We expect our average yield to decline as well. As a reminder in Q4, we temporarily suspended our purchases of new securities and reinvestment of maturing securities in our client funds portfolio. And earlier this month, we resumed reinvesting. We have over $5 billion in securities maturing in fiscal 2021, yielding on average over 2% and we expect to reinvest them at prevailing yields that are well below that level. As a result, we expect our average client funds yield to be down 50 basis points to 1.6% for the year. With this combination of lower balance and yields, we expect interest income on client funds to be $390 million to $400 million, down about $150 million versus fiscal 2020 and we expect interest income from our extended investment strategy to be $430 million to $440 million, down about $125 million versus fiscal 2020. With that said, without the benefit of our client investment strategy, which utilizes laddered maturities, we believe the headwind to fiscal 2020 would have been even greater. Having covered the major macro topics for fiscal 2021 let me share with you how we are deploying our downturn playbook to manage expenses. We have concentrated on areas where we have excess capacity and on reducing discretionary costs, while maintaining investment in sales, products and our associates. And as we emphasized last quarter, we continue to have the strong cash flow profile and balance sheet strength to withstand impacts to our revenue without taking immediate actions on our investments. We said we would be thoughtful and strategic in assessing the most prudent path forward, a path that balances positioning for recovery against near-term margin performance. We have now had a quarter to assess our business capacity and needs. And during the fourth quarter, we identified businesses across ADP, where unfortunately, we didn\u2019t believe a recovery was likely in the near-term and therefore had excess capacity in service and implementation. In addition to taking specific headcount actions, we have further tightened on non-essential spend, including T&E and other discretionary spend. We are also continuing to move forward with our transformation initiatives. For the past few years, we have highlighted for you some of the discrete material initiatives that we have worked on and their estimated level of benefits. In fiscal 2019, we executed on our voluntary early retirement program, which yielded over $150 million in annual run-rate benefits. In fiscal 2020, we executed on our workforce optimization program and a procurement initiative, which together yielded approximately $150 million in annual run-rate savings against our original expectations of $100 million. For fiscal 2021, we have two important initiatives to call out. First, we are moving forward with a digital transformation initiative that leverages many of the capabilities we highlighted at our February 2020 Innovation Day, primarily to optimize our implementation and service in addition to enhancing efficiency in other parts of the organization. As examples, we are further utilizing automation in the implementation process, deploying additional self-service features throughout our platform, broadening the use of guided assist tools and expanding the use of chat and chatbot. We expect this to be a multi-year effort as we work to optimize large parts of our service delivery model. Our innovation agenda is running full speed ahead and that includes innovation in our client engagement. We also expanded our procurement transformation initiative and expect further benefit for fiscal 2021. We have reassessed our real estate footprint and although we had already closed over 70 subscale locations as part of our service alignment initiative in recent years. We recently closed several additional locations, including a large office in New Jersey. We will continue to evaluate whether there was further opportunity for location consolidation. Between these two initiatives, our digital transformation initiative and the expansion of our procurement initiative we expect to realize a combined $125 million in savings during fiscal 2021, with over a $150 million in run-rate savings exiting the year. Let\u2019s now turn to our outlook for fiscal 2021. We will start with the ES segment. We expect a decline of 3% to 5% in revenue for the full year driven by our outlook for a decline in pays per control, balance and yield pressure in our client funds interest portfolio as well as pressure from new business bookings and elevated out-of-business losses. Compared to what we just experienced in the fourth quarter, we expect the first half of fiscal 2021 to experience a slightly greater revenue decline as the incremental impact from lower sales out-of-business losses and lower client funds interest more than offset the gradual recovery in pays per control that we are anticipating. We expect revenue growth to improve modestly in Q3 and then turn positive in Q4. We expect our margin in the Employer Services segment to be down about 300 basis points for the year. And as a reminder, the revenues we lose from pays per control, out-of-business losses, and client funds interest are all high margin. As with revenue, we are expecting a decline in ES margin during the first three quarters and an increase in the fourth quarter. For our PEO, we expect revenue down 2% to up 2% for the full year with average worksite employee count flat to down 3% driven by similar factors as our ES segment, namely headwinds and same-store employment, out-of-business losses and bookings pressure. We expect average worksite employee growth to be negative during the first three quarters and turn positive in Q4. Our revenues, excluding zero margin pass-throughs, are expected to be down 1% to 4% and we continue to expect lower workers\u2019 compensation and SUI pricing. For PEO margin, we expect to be down about 100 basis points in fiscal 2021 driven in part by drag from higher zero margin pass-through revenues partially offset by a favorable compare for ADP Indemnity. With these segment outlooks, we now anticipate total ADP revenue to decline 1% to 4% in fiscal 2021 and we anticipate our adjusted EBIT margin to be down about 300 basis points as the benefits from our continued expense management and transformation initiatives are partially offsetting the detrimental impact \u2013 margin impact of expected lost revenue due to COVID-19 as well as the investments we continue to make. We anticipate our adjusted effective tax rate to be 23.1%. This rate includes less than 10 basis points of estimated excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation related to restricted stock vesting in Q1 of fiscal \u201821. But it does not include any estimated tax benefit related to potential stock option exercises given the dependency of that benefit on the timing of those exercises. Last quarter, we temporarily suspended our share repurchases as we decided it would be prudent to wait for stabilization of the overall environment. At this point, we anticipate resuming our share repurchase program at some point this fiscal year subject to market conditions and we have a slight net share count reduction contemplated in our guidance. And as a result of our outlook for lower revenue and margins and higher tax offset partially by lower share count, we currently expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to decline 13% to 18% in fiscal 2021. As most of you are aware, we also have $1 billion in notes due September of this year. At this point, we expect to issue new debt in the coming weeks or months depending on market conditions. I would like to conclude by saying that although COVID-19 is putting pressure on our financial performance, we believe this is transitory and the long-term prospects for ADP are no way diminished and may even be enhanced by the current environment. For fiscal 2021, we are remaining focused on opportunities for innovation and growth while taking a deliberate balanced approach to managing expenses and we are confident in our long-term growth prospects. I look forward to updating you on our progress. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Mark Marcon from Baird. Your line is open. Mark Marcon : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. One key one is just from a bookings perspective as you look out over the coming year and you gave us a bit of a sense for the cadence that you expect \u2013 which of the new solutions do you expect to see the greatest traction from? Which ones are you the most excited about and which ones could be the most incremental from a really long-term perspective? Carlos Rodriguez : Well, I think from an incremental standpoint \u2013 to start off with the last part of the question from a long-term standpoint, I think some of the investments we have made in some of our next-gen solutions, I think for me has to be one of the most optimistic in terms of potentially moving the needle from an incrementality standpoint right, because we already have a very large, as you know, bookings number and anything that we can add on top of that goes into the top of the funnel in terms of revenue growth. And that\u2019s really was the reason for these investments is to really move the needle competitively and to improve our position from a differentiation standpoint. And so the early signs of course now somewhat temporarily interrupted by COVID-19 were positive in terms of the traction we are getting both with our next-gen HCM platform as well as with our next-gen payroll platform. So that\u2019s kind of where I feel the most optimistic in terms of the long-term. In terms of kind of the cadence and more kind of the short to medium-term in terms of next year \u2013 really the fourth quarter is an important part as we have kind of been alluding to here in our prepared comments and some of that is really clearly the pace of the recovery. So, there is \u2013 we have an expectation, which I think is in line with generally accepted I think forecast, if you will. And you heard kind of as a proxy, the expectation that unemployment reach a certain stage by the end of the fiscal year end, those things are all proxies for GDP growth and you guys all have plenty of access to your own firms\u2019 economic forecast and so forth. So, the second half is really the key for us from a bookings standpoint. And there aside from the incrementality question, this issue that we have around for example, adjusting to our \u2013 adjustments to our gross bookings is an important one, because to the extent that the recovery continues on the pace we expect, it would help us a lot if we would be \u2013 if we can start and continue to implement clients that were previously sold and that \u2013 so clearly one positive would be that, that doesn\u2019t degrade any further, because in full transparency, we mentioned that in our prepared statements that\u2019s a concern under this kind of environment, but there is potential upside as well there. So there is downside and there is upside there as well. But when you see the incredible decrease in activity in just a couple of months following the beginning of the crisis, it takes a while for that \u2013 those buckets to get filled up again in terms of leads, then turning into first deployments, then turning into presentations to clients. So, that whole process of how the sales evolution goes is critical for us in the second half. And the places that were hurt the most, which in our case and some of it is perhaps just because of the nature of the crisis that the down-market was hit very, very hard in terms of pays per control and also just declines in activity, but also came back, frankly surprisingly \u2013 you can\u2019t call it strong because it is still down year-over-year, but I think the bookings performance in the down market has been I think gratifying. And so if we continue on that trend, that would be good news for the second half of the year. And then we expect based on the current trends that the mid-market and the up market will then kind of follow suit as the kind of pipeline leading indicators that we mentioned translate into actual bookings and actual sales. So I guess, the short story is the things that were the hardest hit are the things that \u2013 in the initial stages are the things that should have, in our opinion, the biggest rebound in the second half. And then on top of that obviously, our new product investments I think are a source of optimism for us. We\u2019ve also invested in I think you heard us mention Workforce Management in the down market. I mean, we have a lot of things going on. You can see it in our investments in technology over the last four to five years and obviously some of those things are longer-term like the next-gen stuff. Some of it has been we have been investment phase for 6 to 12 months and we expect those things to translate now into new sales. So I don\u2019t know if you heard our tone over the last several years, we pivoted to investing more in product and particularly more around Agile technology and that hopefully gives us some firepower here in terms of our bookings incrementality going into this year, but also into the following years as well. Mark Marcon : Great. Kathleen Winters : Mark, yes, just to add a little bit more there in terms of by each segment for sure we are expecting sales growth across each of the segments in fiscal \u201821. And as Carlos said, down market seems to be resilient and has trended up since we were at the low point several weeks ago but down market has been trending up earlier. And then during the latter part of the year, we would expect up markets and international for that matter to continue along those lines, but for sure expecting sales growth across all segments. And to Carlos\u2019 point, from a long-term incremental perspective, certainly expecting Next-Gen HCM to be a driver there, but our strategic platforms in the near-term RUN and Workforce Now have been performing really well in the market and we expect them to continue to perform really well in the market as we recover through this. Mark Marcon : Great. Just as a follow-up, could you just give us an update in terms of where we stand in terms of the number of implementations on next-gen HCM or sometimes known as Lifion and also next-gen payroll this percentage of the client base has been converted? Carlos Rodriguez : So on next-gen HCM, you could probably appreciate for two, three months, that wasn\u2019t really something that a lot of companies were focused on and for that matter us [indiscernible] unfortunate. But the good news is we did actually start a client just a week ago. So that is a ray of sunshine in what was otherwise a lot of dark clouds. So we had a number of clients that were set to be implemented in our fourth fiscal quarter, which delayed and one of those actually started here already in the early part of the first quarter. So that is encouraging but we are not that different from where we were before. So call it still a handful, I think we have like seven or eight clients live somewhere in that neighborhood on next-gen HCM. On next-gen payroll, there the target at the beginning from a piloting standpoint really was \u2013 clients are not quite the same size of next-gen HCM. So it\u2019s a slightly different dynamic and it\u2019s \u2013 and we\u2019re making, in terms of numbers of clients more progress, but it doesn\u2019t mean that the product necessarily is making more progress. It\u2019s just the difference between the markets we\u2019re serving. Next-gen HCM is really in the early stages aimed more at the mid-market, if you will, than really the up market even though we expect it to be our next-gen payroll engine across our mid-market and up market in the initial stages, it\u2019s really mid-market. So I think we have somewhere around 100 clients sold. And I think maybe that same number implemented, if I\u2019m not mistaken. Kathleen Winters : That\u2019s right. Carlos Rodriguez : So we\u2019re making some good progress there. And there the pace is a little bit better in the sense that we didn\u2019t come to a complete stop on next-gen payroll and we continue to implement clients there and kind of move forward. But it\u2019s a \u2013 this is a very challenging situation for our clients and we really need to kind of help them get through this situation and the crisis not necessarily press them to get started as quickly as possible although that\u2019s obviously our desire from our standpoint. Mark Marcon : Of course. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Your line is open. Please check if your line is on mute. Ramsey El-Assal: Can you hear me now? Carlos Rodriguez : Yes, we can hear. Yep, go ahead. Danyal Hussain : Yes, go ahead. We can hear you, if you? Ramsey El-Assal: Hello, hello. Operator : Pardon me, sir. Please proceed with your question. And we will move on to our next question. Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning. Could you characterize the gross bookings performance in the June quarter prior to the backlog adjustment? Carlos Rodriguez : Yes, I mean I think we \u2013 we\u2019re just trying to give a nod to our sales force in terms of \u2013 they were \u2013 they performed better than we clearly had forecasted and that we gave in terms of color, commentary during this same earnings call or during the earnings call of the last quarter, but they were still down significantly. So at the end of the day, we just want to make sure that you guys got the right impression that we weren\u2019t disappointed and that we didn\u2019t do worse than we expected. But from a mechanical number standpoint \u2013 think still down somewhere around 50% like if that\u2019s a fair characterization. I don\u2019t know if Kathleen has any more color there? Kathleen Winters : Yes, no, the gross bookings were slightly positive to what we had expected. The approximately, down 50% is right, which is what we have been anticipating. And then the backlog adjustment, which actually is part of our normal process factored into the overall bookings number being down slightly more than that for the fourth quarter. David Togut : Got it. And just as my follow-up, assuming the employment recovery proceeds as you have laid out Kathleen negative 7% unemployment by the end of FY \u201821, would you expect to be back on your sort of normalized growth path by FY \u201822? Kathleen Winters : Yes, go ahead Carlos. Carlos Rodriguez : No, go ahead, go ahead. Kathleen Winters : It\u2019s a great question in terms of when do we return to previous levels of growth and profitability. And as you pointed out, a lot really depends on the shape of the recovery. And look, we have taken the best view we can and tried to share with you what we are thinking about that in terms of the shape of that recovery. But it really is going to depend on that. Last recession, it took a couple of years for sales and retention and revenue growth to return to the pre-recession levels. Now, is it going to look exactly like it looked last time? We don\u2019t know. This crisis is different. The make-up of ADP is different. So, I hate to say it, but it\u2019s going to depend on a lot of factors but returning to those previous growth rates certainly will not be in fiscal \u201821 based on what we see right now and we will update you as things change and as we go through the current year. Carlos Rodriguez : I think, maybe just add a little bit of \u2013 just in terms of my own observations from looking at the kind of the quarterly cadence, if you will and how \u2013 what the implications are for FY \u201822, it really depends on \u2013 are we thinking about sales? Are we thinking about revenue? Are we thinking about profit growth? And they are all kind of different buckets. But I guess and to Kathleen\u2019s point, it really all depends \u2013 if this is unlike the financial crisis, not a two or three, the financial crisis really was \u2013 you go back and think about it, the kind of mini crisis that occurred over the course of the following two or three years. Remember, we had the European debt crisis. We had a number of things that elongated that situation, but that could happen here as well, and we are of course not scientists and we don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s going to happen. But we\u2019re using kind of the same forecast that I think all of you are using and if you make those assumptions around when the healthcare crisis passes, i.e., vaccines and therapeutics and so forth. If you follow that path then FY \u201822, when we exit in the fourth quarter of FY \u201821 \u2013 from a mathematical standpoint \u2013 I think you used the term growth rates, the growth rates are going to look pretty good in terms of as you exit from a booking standpoint and then starting maybe with profitability in the first quarter of FY \u201822 because in the fourth quarter of FY \u201821 we saw some NDE expense. But some of that \u2013 frankly is really the comparisons. So we have three quarters in FY \u201822 that are going to look pretty good. Because if we still think that the first couple of quarters of FY \u201821 are still impacted pretty significantly by COVID and by the first couple of quarters of FY \u201822 you don\u2019t have that impact you are going to have some I hope some really good tailwinds on some of these growth numbers. But the key for me was looking at absolute booking dollars in the fourth quarter of \u201821 compared to the fourth quarter of \u201819 because obviously \u201820 is not a good comparison and looking also at our absolute profitability in the fourth quarter of \u201821 and our revenue in the fourth quarter of \u201821. And again, I feel some sense of optimism about \u201822 based on those exit rate assumptions with a capital assumption because this is \u2013 we are a long way away from having certainty and you have seen how fluid the situation has been. But I think the math I think works kind of favorably once we get through fiscal year \u201821 and particularly when we get through the first three quarters of fiscal year \u201821. David Togut : Understood. Greatly appreciated. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Your line is open. Jason Kupferberg : Thanks, good morning guys. Just wanted to start with kind of a high-level question on the fiscal \u201821 guide, I mean, we have got revenue down modestly, but obviously EPS down quite a bit and that\u2019s being driven by a little bit of tax, but really the 300 bps of EBIT margin decline. And I guess it looks like the transformation savings should largely offset the hit to float income. So, are we really just down to kind of isolating this against decremental margins that maybe people didn\u2019t appreciate the \u2013 kind of the severity of or are there other factors there? Because I just think at a high level people were surprised to see how much EPS is going to be down relative to revenue for the current fiscal year? Carlos Rodriguez : Let me take a crack at a couple of high level things. And then Kathleen probably can provide some additional maybe detail to help in terms of quantify some of the stuff. But we \u2013 I\u2019m not sure if it was clear from our comments last quarter or this quarter but having been through these types of \u2013 not through a healthcare crisis but I personally have been through dot com downturn, Y2K at ADP, 9/11 and the Global Financial Crisis. And our Board is a Board that is long-term oriented and it feels like despite how horrible the situation is, it feels like this situation is transitory and so one of the things that we have as a first principle is to maintain our level of investment. That doesn\u2019t mean that we are not prudent around our expenses and I think we have been and I think Kathleen gave you some examples of some of the things that that we are doing. But we are going to add to our sales head count next year, which might surprise some people and maybe not something that you were expecting. And the problem is that when you model only one fiscal year for a company like ADP or recurring revenue model, if you decrease your sales cost or even your investment in product and technology, it actually looks quite favorable. And you can probably offset quite a bit of revenue decline. The question is, is that really the right thing to do long-term? We don\u2019t believe that it is and so that\u2019s one factor, philosophically. The second factor is that even though we clearly have some decline in the number of clients, the nature of the revenues that are going down is very high margin. So you mentioned client funds interest, but we also have another decrease from a comparison standpoint \u201820 to \u201821 in pays per control, which is call it 100% margin as well. And there is very little work related to the number of worksite, I am sorry, the number of employees paid by our clients. Our work is \u2013 workload is generally driven by number of clients and then as we have all now observed in the last quarter also driven a lot by the regulatory environment. And so the amount of work has not decreased much and in some cases has increased on behalf of our clients. And again, that\u2019s a place where we could cut some of that support. And then it would lead to lower NPS scores and we probably would have retention go down, but the single most important driver of financial value for ADP is client retention and lifetime value. To lose clients and then have to go sell them again and implement them again makes absolutely no sense and all the experience we \u2013 that I have and we have and our Board has tells us to kind of stand firm and make sure that \u2013 that doesn\u2019t mean that we ignore the realities around us. If we thought that this was a permanent decrease in capacity of the economy or in terms of the global outlook, and then it was going to last two, three, four years, we probably would be behaving differently, but that\u2019s not our expectation, that\u2019s not our \u2013 that\u2019s not the way that we are managing the company. There\u2019s also a couple of other items I think that mathematically may be not helping us and maybe Kathleen can help a little bit with some of those sure. Kathleen Winters : Yes. Look, on the surface the guide to 300 basis point decline on the surface may sound like a lot, but there\u2019s a lot going on in there. When you take it apart, I think it\u2019s really \u2013 and you put it into the kind of buckets, I think you will see how we arrived at that guidance and that expectation, right? As we\u2019ve talked about and as you know we\u2019ve got obviously a substantial impact from loss \u2013 a very high margin revenue, right? We\u2019ve got that high margin revenue. We\u2019ve got clients on interest, which is a hurt on margin year-over-year. We also have growth in zero margin pass-throughs, which falls right to the bottom line from a margin perspective. That\u2019s going to be a significant hurt for us where it hasn\u2019t been as much in the past. And the continued investment along the lines of \u2013 look, we think it\u2019s prudent and smart to take to continue our long-term view and to continue to invest in sales and in product. We are committed to that level of investment so that\u2019s a hurt. And then you do have, as you pointed out, the transformation and other cost actions that we\u2019ve been taking that only partially offset that. So I would think about it in those buckets in terms of, look, you\u2019ve got this high margin revenue. You\u2019ve got some other things that fall right to the bottom line like zero margin pass-throughs and client funds interest. You\u2019ve got the commitment to continuing to invest and quite frankly, I think we have been executing really well from a transformation perspective and also in terms of looking at \u2013 as we navigate through this period the excess capacity cost that we have and being really smart about addressing those. Carlos Rodriguez : But I guess let me \u2013 just to provide a little bit of color on kind of our view because I learned the hard way from my two predecessors about some of these things. So if you just look at the sales engine aspect of our business and you look at it over multiple years, you can actually do the math that if our \u2013 if we decreased our head count, call it 5% or even if we just kept it flat and you assume the productivity continued on kind of its normal trend, which is a big assumption, but if you even \u2013 if you assume that, you can see the impact that has on revenue growth from multiple years down the road. So obviously, if you expect that you\u2019re not going to be able to ever return to the same kind of sales productivity you had before, then you have to do something differently, but that\u2019s not the expectation we have right now. And it\u2019s critical to our growth in \u201822, \u201823, and \u201824 for us to maintain our investment in our sales engine. Not to mention in our product and our technology and a few other places as well. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. Yes, that\u2019s really good color. For my follow-up, I wanted to ask just about retention. I know you are forecasting the 50 bps to 100 bps decline this year. I wanted to see if we can get a sense of how that compares to how you exited the June quarter on that metric? And I\u2019m really just trying to get a sense of whether you are forecasting acceleration in churn over the next few quarters or more of just kind of a stable and steady pace of churn? Carlos Rodriguez : Again, let me give you some maybe philosophical, high-level comments and then Kathleen, maybe can give you some color around the fourth quarter and some of the assumptions. So in general, we have been, and I\u2019ve been again, having been through multiple downturns and crises, I have been surprised by the resilience of our retention and we think there could be a number of factors here. One of them could be all of the government stimulus, the Paycheck Protection Program, all these things might \u2013 these are all new things compared to the past that might be helping. There is also the potential that some clients are frozen in place, if you will, like, we\u2019ve talked about how difficult our bookings have been. I think logic would tell me that that\u2019s probably happening across multiple industries and multiple competitors. And so we would be \u2013 actually dishonest not to assume that that might be helping our retention in some parts of our business like the mid-market and the up-market because in the down-market it\u2019s really driven more by out of business. So having said all that, I would say that a lot of these things are really about timing because if there continues to be government stimulus and there continues to be optimism about this being transitory, then I think this kind of holds. And you have probably some additional fallout in the downmarket as a result of out of business and so forth, but you don\u2019t have kind of a major downturn or a collapse in retention. And that\u2019s kind of where I am today that we are expecting what I would say is \u2013 I would consider these to be reasonable and modest declines in retention when you compare them to other downturns that we have some data on and some history about. Kathleen Winters : Yes, and we did do a lot of work around and analysis around what happened in the last recession and what happened to retention by segment. And I think we have got a pretty balanced view if you look at the decline in retention that we experienced in Q4 and what we are guiding to and expecting and planning for in fiscal \u201821. It\u2019s basically in line with the retention pressure that we had during the last recession. So we will see. I mean, it\u2019s really hard to predict. And to tell what level of support the PPP program has had and is going to have, but that\u2019s our best view right now. Carlos Rodriguez : I think \u2013 I don\u2019t literally don\u2019t give it. But I think I feel like this is an environment where transparency is probably not a bad idea just to give you like \u2013 like, that\u2019s why we gave you kind of the gross bookings number besides the net bookings number because you guys need to model this stuff so you can understand what\u2019s happening here. But think the fourth quarter somewhere around couple of hundred basis point decline in retention, which I think again all things considered, I thought was, and most of that decline frankly came in the down-market. So, that to me feels like better than I would have expected 3 months before that. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. Alright, well, we appreciate all the disclosure. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tien- tsin Huang : Hi, thanks so much for all this detail. Just on the transformation initiatives, I caught all the details there. How about looking beyond those two initiatives? Are there any other potential actions that you could take, anything that could be material over a similar size? Carlos Rodriguez : Again, I will maybe give some high-level comments and let, I think Kathleen give some additional detail. We have a very large menu of things that we can do. This company has a very, very long history of navigating through multiple changes in environments and multiple economic circumstances and now I think we will add to our repertoire managing through a major health crisis and a pandemic. And so, we have \u2013 I don\u2019t know how else to put it. We have a huge number of things that we could do, if necessary, and when necessary. This is an incredibly resilient business model. I recognize that this is unusual for ADP to be down the way we are, but it is what it is in terms of the economic circumstances around us. But believe me; we have a number of levers. So as I said, like some of these things are \u2013 and our business model are somewhat self-correcting. If in the unlikely event, there was a belief that there was a permanent impairment of kind of global economic GDP or growth vis-\u00e0-vis other industries or other companies, I think that we are in somewhat of a better place because the amount of money that we spend on NDE and on implementation alone would, at least for the short-term, would certainly enhance our bottom line and help us from a margin standpoint. That\u2019s not what we want because the real value to be created here is through growth \u2013 like, through profitable growth, not by kind of shrinking our way into profitability. But we have no intentions of allowing ourselves to underperform, if you will, on a long-term basis below what we have delivered for many, many decades. And that\u2019s what \u201821 is all about. But if circumstances change, we have a very long list and quite a lot of variable expense in our P&L and a very strong balance sheet and a very strong cash position. Kathleen Winters : So, Tien-tsin, thank you for the question, it\u2019s a logical question because when you think about kind of the past and the history over the last several years, right, in terms of what we\u2019ve been driving from a transformation perspective, you can see that we have had these \u2013 several kind of big major initiatives over the last several years, right. We had Service Alignment Initiative first. We have a Voluntary Early Retirement program. We told you about the workforce optimization and then the procurement and now the procurement continues and we have shared with you our work that we have doing around digital transformation. The question, what comes next? Quite frankly, I think there is a lot of runway and we have a lot to do from a digital standpoint and also from a procurement standpoint. It does get harder as you go, I will say, but there is a lot to do there. And a lot of the digital projects, first of all, the digital is certainly focused on our service and implementation, because there is opportunity there, but it is across the entire company. So every single segment and every single department, whether you are front-office or your back-office is tasked with thinking about digital transformation, automation, how do you make the work more efficient, how do you take work out? There is runway there. So I expect that you will hear us talking about that for some time to come. The procurement, well, it does get harder as you go. What I would say is, in an environment like this that we are in right now, in a downturn, it does present some procurement opportunities that may be didn\u2019t exist a year ago \u2013 when you actually \u2013 when you go back and you are negotiating with vendors and suppliers and so forth. So we have got real work to do there. And as you heard us say in the prepared comments, we have expanded procurement to make sure we are capturing all the opportunities. From a real estate perspective in terms of, look, the environment has changed. The way the world is working has changed. Let\u2019s make sure we are thinking about our real estate footprint in a fresh modern, forward-looking way to ensure we are utilizing the assets that we have to the fullest extent possible. We are understanding how we are going to get work done in the future. We are understanding how we can utilize mobility models where it makes sense to do that. So we have got a lot of work and some really good work to do here from a digital procurement real estate perspective. Carlos Rodriguez : And just one last comment on that, the other thing that maybe is under-appreciated but it\u2019s worth mentioning here because again, we are typically not talking about these things as they are more longer-term, but if your question was really more about what\u2019s potentially next, longer-term and not just in \u201821, our next-gen investments are the largest potential digital transformation effort we have ever undergone. And we always focus on them around what they are going to do in terms of our winning in the marketplace and our sales growth and our revenue growth. But trust me when I tell you that the business cases for those investments and the progress we have been making over all these years, there\u2019s an enormous expectation for, call it automation, call it efficiency, whatever you want to call it and we don\u2019t usually talk about our tax engine, we talk about HCM and payroll. But one of those next-gen investments is our tax engine, which again there, the early signs \u2013 we already have a couple of hundred thousand clients migrated onto that platform. And when you see how quickly we are able to make these legislative changes in that platform and the cost structure and the cost of support again, I would be very optimistic that one of the largest transformation efforts we will be talking about in the future when we look backwards is these next-generation investments. I am hoping they are also going to lead to big growth incrementality and winning more market share in the marketplace, but do not underestimate the value of these investments in terms of our back-office and also our cost structure. Tien- tsin Huang : Yes. No, thank you for that. That\u2019s very complete answer. If you don\u2019t mind, just one quick follow-up, you mentioned the legislative changes and a lot of the work and effort that you have put into that. And Carlos, I know I ask you this all the time. So I am going to ask you again, could we see more demand? I know you mentioned improved bookings momentum that you started to see, but could you see more demand for the service model in general here? I don\u2019t know where you are seeing maybe some switching from or more demand for work but again election year, lot of complexity, probably more changes coming. Could that help you here? Carlos Rodriguez : I mean, I don\u2019t see how it can\u2019t. So and usually, I am not that optimistic or that definitive because if it were only the election, I would say, we will have to wait and see. But I don\u2019t, again, I am not usually a pontificator, but I just don\u2019t see how companies after all this don\u2019t reassess not just kind of how they do HCM and payroll and so forth, but so many other parts of their business model where continuity and resiliency and so forth are critical and that applies to the smallest client to the very largest clients. I think that for a lot of us, I don\u2019t think we are the only ones or the only industry or space where that\u2019s going to be a tailwind but it\u2019s hard to believe that this in a positive. Now, in what quarter and how do I qualify that because you have GDP going down, I don\u2019t know, 30-something-percent in the second quarter. Even if people were thinking about that, that wasn\u2019t really going to be a factor certainly in the fourth quarter. The question is how does that net out in the math, right, because you want to somehow be able to parse that out and understand how much of is incremental. And I can\u2019t necessarily do that scientifically but intellectually, it\u2019s hard to believe that it is in a tailwind going forward for us. And then on the election side, we like \u2013 we generally like change because \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t matter whether one party versus the other. We are apolitical as a company. But usually when there\u2019s change there is change and for employers. Employers are an instrument of policy of the government, it\u2019s how public policy gets effectuated whether it\u2019s through tax or all the various safety policies and \u2013 you are seeing all these changes in leave policies now to help manage through the health crisis. So that\u2019s all incredible, I think opportunity for us to help our clients and when there is opportunity to help clients, that\u2019s opportunity to sell new business as well. Tien- tsin Huang : Yes, agreed. Thank you. Have a safe rest of the summer. Thanks. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you. You too. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Bryan Keane : Hi, guys. Good morning. I just wanted to ask take another crack on the margin question and looking at it from this perspective. The fourth quarter margin in ES was impressive to bring it to flat and you took a lot of the brunt of the hit. Just thinking about that fourth quarter versus the guide of down 300 basis points, I guess I am a little surprised that it doesn\u2019t hold up better. Can you just contrast the margins in the fourth quarter being flat versus down 300 basis points from that perspective? Carlos Rodriguez : Sure. I mean, I think some of it is \u2013 Kathleen will go through some of the math but the client funds interest impact is much bigger I think going forward than it was in the fourth quarter because of the laddering that we do in our portfolio. The impact for example of bookings \u2013 we still had a lot of business starting because remember, there is a lag between bookings and starts. So I think you would all be very surprised by how much. Even though we had some delays in some \u2013 particularly for larger clients, we started a lot of business in the fourth quarter also and as kind of bookings decline now the starts and the amount of revenue that goes into the run rate declines as well as you move forward. And so you get that sales number back up again. So I think there are a number of just kind of mathematical realities that I think that hit us in the next two or three quarters in comparison the fourth quarter. But I think that, again, we are not going to do that, like, we are not going to provide quarterly guidance, but I would encourage you to attempt to do either a first half or a second half based on the tone that you are hearing from us or even attempt to do it by quarter because the view that we have of the fourth quarter, again assuming the assumptions are correct, I think paints a very different picture than the picture may be that you are getting by looking at a \u201821 number. I would also argue that when we talk about \u201821, its fiscal \u201821, which happens to be only 6 months of \u201821. For every other company out there when you talk about \u201821, you are talking about the beginning of January of \u201821 where everybody expects everything already to be back to normal and that is \u2013 in terms of assumption of things being back to normal. So it\u2019s a little bit maybe tricky in terms of the thought process and the math. But I don\u2019t know if Kathleen has anything to add on that? Kathleen Winters : Yes, I mean, yes, it\u2019s a little bit hard to say, okay, compare one quarter to a full year particularly in a year like this when there is so much going on and there\u2019s so much linearity aspect in fiscal \u201821. But what I will say is in Q4 we did have sales expense, our NDE was actually a little bit of a help in Q4 versus it ends up being a surge so that\u2019s kind of one difference one to the other. And the other thing is, from a transformation perspective in terms of benefits and how the benefits flow, well, certainly being a favorable and a help for us in each year in fiscal \u201820 and in fiscal \u201821, in Q4 there is a pretty substantial impact favorability from transformation if you were to compare it to a full year fiscal \u201821. So it\u2019s kind of a math of how it all falls out in a quarter versus in a full year. But again, think about fiscal \u201820 as sorry, fiscal \u201821 as look, you have got this high margin revenue. You have got top line stuff that falls right to the bottom line being the zero margin pass-through and the client funds interest. You have got our continued commitment to investments. So you have got that from sales expense partially offset by continued transformation work. Bryan Keane : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just a quick follow-up, the elevated out-of-business losses, just trying to get a sense of how that\u2019s compared in past recessions and then how much more do we have to go on that? I mean have you written down the majority of it and there\u2019s just a little bit left over because I know in fiscal year \u201821 you are saying there will be some more losses. So just trying to get an impact of magnitude of previous recessions and how much is left? Thanks. Carlos Rodriguez : So that really comes through in the retention. So it\u2019s not really, we don\u2019t quote, unquote, write it down, right? So that really comes through in terms of the losses from a retention standpoint. We have like maybe others some clients that have quote, unquote stopped processing and, but they are still there, and so there is a question of which of those clients come back and which of those clients don\u2019t come back. But we have modeled in the down-market, this is really a down-market issue. We hope that it\u2019s a down-market issue. At least in prior economic cycle that\u2019s been the case. And I think you see it reflected in our retention rate, but it\u2019s very, very hard for us to say with any level of certainty, how that\u2019s going to exactly play out in the future. We have looked at all the prior downturns, and we know that there\u2019s probably some out of business that\u2019s still there that\u2019s going to occur. And a lot of this is, in this case is going to depend on government stimulus and whether there continues to be some support for small business or not and also just the overall level of GDP and obviously the overall pace of recovery in terms of people going back to spending on products that help small businesses survive. Bryan Keane : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Lisa Ellis : Hi, good morning guys. I apologize. I am going to ask one more question on margins. Just a clarification on the backside because I think that may be the effect of the de-leveraging related to pays per control, I think a little bit steeper than we were expecting, etcetera. Is the implication of that that coming out of this as we get back to better employment levels late in \u201821 that you would see a sort of similar snapback, is that the way we should be thinking about it as unemployment improves? I mean, when we are looking out into FY \u201822 or are there reasons that we wouldn\u2019t expect that to happen? Thanks. Carlos Rodriguez : No, I think that\u2019s right. And again, hate to go back to, because I think I would encourage you like I am doing the focus on both growth rates, but also, because I know they are important in terms of models and so forth, but absolute numbers as well because if pays per control doesn\u2019t grow in the fourth quarter of fiscal year \u201822 we have a serious problem; like if there\u2019s not a big snapback of that number, like if there isn\u2019t a huge snapback of bookings, we have serious problems. And so the only thing that we think is not something that we want to model improving is interest rates because it just doesn\u2019t feel like is a basis for doing that, but I think if you take reasonable assumptions based on economic forecast, you do have a fairly significant snapback in terms of growth rates, if you will or improvement percentages. The question then is, what does that mean in terms of absolute numbers? And so if you still have 7% unemployment, by definition that unemployment rate is still higher than it was in the, call it third quarter of fiscal year \u201820 and that has some implications in terms of absolute level if you will, of pays per control and we have kind of modeled that in to our assumptions but for sure there\u2019s snapback in the numbers. There is no denying. Lisa Ellis : Good. Okay, alright. And then just my follow-up is related to the PEO; as you are seeing because I know you don\u2019t \u2013 your bookings are yes, related bookings so just a kind of question on demand environment for the PEO. As you are seeing companies adjusting now to the crisis and to the recession how is demand acting for the PEO? Meaning is it positive, because companies are looking to variabilize cost or are you seeing some companies move away from the PEO because of reducing benefits? What does that demand outlook look like? Thank you. Carlos Rodriguez : I think the demand so far. Our experience in the PEO has been that it was kind of in line with the rest of the business. It looked a little more resilient in April, which you may have heard that tone from us but then May and June, pretty much in line with what was happening across, yes, In terms of bookings demand. And I think some of that is because of just the sales cycle. If you think about the PEO the sales cycle resembles more the up-market. The lower end of the up-market than it does the down-market, even though the average client size is small and that\u2019s because it\u2019s a high involvement product and high involvement sale because you are basically turning over all of your HCM including your benefits your workers\u2019 comp, etcetera. So, I think that\u2019s what we have seen in the short term. If you look at again 20, 25 years worth of history, I can\u2019t even believe I have been doing this for that long, but I started my career in the PEO and every time there is an economic cycle or a change, whether it\u2019s dot com or financial crisis, whenever there is a lot of theories. And I think the secular demand and growth of the PEO doesn\u2019t seem to be impacted by many things. So I would still expect that kind of solution to have a lot of legs for small and mid-size clients for a long time to come. In the interim, there could be ups and downs, because as you said if companies are quote unquote hunkering down and don\u2019t want to offer benefits \u2013 at least in our PEO part of the value proposition is benefits and so \u2013 but so far when you look at sales results, lead generation activity, etcetera, there is no reason to believe that the PEO won\u2019t recover in the same way that we expect the rest of the business to recover from a booking standpoint. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Wald from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Steven Wald : Great, thanks for taking my question. Could we just \u2013 coming at some of the implicit assumptions under the guidance another angle. Just curious what you guys thoughts are in terms of what you are seeing conditions on the ground wise in terms of geographic concentration. I mean certainly some parts of the country are more open than others, some industries are doing better than others, I guess, I am just curious if you guys could sort of separate out how you guys are thinking about that on the go-forward and the unevenness of the recovery and what that means for your client base? I know you have talked about being diversified, but certainly there is a quite disparate experience level across the country right now. Carlos Rodriguez : It\u2019s a great question. I think you probably saw in our comments that we said that we observed in our data that there has been a slowdown in the last few weeks, so we are looking at the data weekly and we do look at it geographically, both globally in terms of by country but also within the U.S. by state. And as you would expect part of the challenge in the last several weeks and months has been in the places where you have seen some of the comeback in terms of the virus. The resurgence of the virus in kind of the southern states and also Texas and California, but nothing back to kind of the full shutdown that we saw in April, which is in line with what you are all seeing as well in the news and so forth. This is more about leveling off of growth rather than kind of a decline. So we have seen it in the same metrics that I talked about in the last quarter. So, I can see it in like the number of job postings and screenings and so forth that have \u2013 that were on an upward trend line and frankly it was certainly not a V, but it was a nice upwardly sloped trend language then it was translating into improved employment both in our numbers, but also in the government reported numbers, but we have seen a plateauing of that as of the last 2 or 3 weeks. And so that\u2019s something that we \u2013 fortunately we re-looked at our assumptions for fiscal year \u201821 the assumptions we have for pays per control for the first quarter are around what the pays per control exit growth rate was for the fourth quarter and based on this kind of plateauing that feels like the right place for us to be. And the problem is we don\u2019t want to necessarily go tweak the second quarter, the third quarter and the fourth quarter, because as you have seen over the last 3 or 4 months, 3 or 4 months ago we were actually thinking about opening our office in Orlando \u2013 in Maitland, Orlando, because everything was fine in Florida and nothing was happening in Florida and we didn\u2019t know what the hell we were going to do in New Jersey and New York. And as we sit here today I am sitting in the office in New Jersey and we are not opening anything in Florida. So, I think it\u2019s unfortunately a very fluid situation and you just have to keep an eye on all of these assumptions both at the macro level, but as you said, we have very detailed information and a heat map by state. And I would say that what you are hearing and seeing in the news is what we are seeing in the data. But what that\u2019s translating into is a plateauing or a leveling off of employment short-term so far, not a decline. Steven Wald : That\u2019s very helpful. Maybe if I could just squeeze a quick follow-up in here. Carlos, I think you have laid out at your Innovation Day earlier this year that the addressable market ADP sits in, it\u2019s about $150 billion of revenue a year growing at 5% to 6%. Obviously, that\u2019s changed given COVID, but I am just curious to get any updated thoughts you have around maybe where that stands today? But if you can really speak to where it stands today given the fluidity of the situation, how we are thinking about it coming out of it given your comments and Kathleen\u2019s comments about the enhanced opportunity for the space you are in? Carlos Rodriguez : Listen there is a lot of smart analysts out there and industry analysts out there that would probably be better answering that question. And they probably are going to need a little bit more time and information to answer that question. But I will answer it the same way that I answered it earlier today, which is I don\u2019t know by how much, but it\u2019s hard to believe that past the transitory nature of the situation that, that growth rate for the industry isn\u2019t at least what it is if not higher because and again, I am not trying to be arrogant that, that is only for HCM, but there are other industries that I think have, shouldn\u2019t have tailwind from these events, where the acceleration of people to using cloud services and using what I would consider to be outsourced services so that you can focus on your core business, but also have resiliency. I think and also so that you can improve efficiency and you can improve productivity of your workforce and improve engagement of your workforce. All of those things I think are going to get tailwind and it\u2019s across multiple technology sectors that I think are going to probably benefit on a longer term on a medium term and longer term basis from this unfortunate situation. Steven Wald : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos Rodriguez : Thanks. So just a couple of final thoughts. One is I know I said it before, but we have navigated through a lot of issues over many decades. I have had the experience of being through several myself, whether it\u2019s the dotcom recession, what happened after 9/11, the global financial crisis, because in that case, it was really a synchronized global downturn and now this health crisis. And the one thing that I would say about ADP\u2019s business model regardless of I know the focus here is on the short-term, but if you stay focused on the long-term, it\u2019s an incredibly resilient business model, financial model, but also business model. The value of our products and our services is key and one small anecdote, I think we may have mentioned it in the last call. But as kind of this crisis unfolded we had to become like many other parts of the economy, we had to go and talk to governors and leaders, including the White House to make sure that we were deemed an essential service, because we needed to stay in operation. And so I don\u2019t know what better sign there is of a resilient long-term model than to be considered an essential service, because we definitely \u2013 we definitely are. We are glad we were there to help our clients will still be there to help our clients. But I think that speaks volumes to the long-term viability and also upside of the business that we are a critical service an essential service to the economy and to our clients. We are proud of that. And I am proud of what our associates did to live up to that expectation. And as to the next year again, I would just encourage everyone to think through kind of first half second half or even by quarter because at least for me assuming that we stay on the trajectory that we are on, which I realize is fluid, but with those assumptions the fourth quarter exit rate of FY \u201821 is really what I am focused on and not necessarily the short-term results of the first few quarters of FY \u201821 although we are going to do our best to perform as well as we can throughout that as well. And lastly, I know Kathleen said in her comments, but we are very proud to have delivered $1.5 billion in cash back to the dividends and $1 billion through buybacks through, which I think is also another sign of the incredible resilience. And I think cash flow generation capability of this business model in this kind of short-term hit that we are having to revenues and to profitability, I don\u2019t believe will impair our ability to continue that tradition of returning cash to our shareholders. And for that, I want to say that I appreciate the patience of our shareholders as well and all of you. And I thank you today for listening to us and for all your questions. And I wish you all a very safe summer as well. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Crystal, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's First Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. And all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Danyal Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Danyal Hussain : Thank you, Crystal. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining ADP's first quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call and webcast. Participating today are Carlos Rodriguez, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathleen Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC's website and on our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call as well as our quarterly history of revenue and pretax earnings by reportable segment. During our call today, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these items, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, can be found in our earnings release. Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. As always, please do not hesitate to reach out, should you have any questions. And with that, let me turn the call over to Carlos. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you, Danny, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call. This morning, we reported excellent first quarter fiscal 2021 results. I'm very pleased to say that across the board, we delivered a very strong start to the year that was well in excess of our expectations. For the quarter, we delivered revenue of $3.5 billion down just 1% on both reported and organic constant currency basis. And our adjusted EBIT margin was up 120 basis points, coupled with a slight increase in the effective tax rate versus last year in a share count reduction. Our adjusted diluted EPS grew 5%, much better than our expectation three months ago, which was for a meaningful decrease in EPS. On this call, we'll discuss the changes that drove ADP\u2019s better-than-expected start the fiscal 2021. In Q1, macroeconomic conditions continued to gradually improve and we executed extremely well in several key categories, including better-than-expected sales performance, a continued commitment to client service and prudent expense management. Let me start by covering key macro related trends to provide context to our results. Specifically on pays per control, out-of-business losses and client funds interest. During the first quarter, pays per control, which as a reminder declined 11% in the fourth quarter was in line with our expectation for high single-digit decline with a year-over-year decline of 9%. And a continuation of the trend we saw into our fiscal 2020 year-end, employment small businesses continued to show the most improvement, while large businesses actually showed some degradation as we exited the first quarter. Out-of-business losses performed better-than-expected as small business losses stabilized and a substantial number of clients that had gone inactive last quarter have restarted processing activities over the last three months. Finally, average client funds interest rates declined in line with our expectations for the quarter, but client funds balances were favorable to our expectations, declining 7% compared to our double-digit expectation. With that said, let me shift to the highlights resulting from our own execution. We delivered positive 2% growth in employer services new business bookings, which was significantly ahead of our expectations and marked a record Q1 performance. As you may recall from our commentary last quarter, we did expect some amount of sequential improvement relative to our Q4 bookings performance as economic condition stabilized. However, we delivered a much faster reacceleration as our sales force started strong in July and carry that momentum through the end of the quarter. We attribute the rapid reacceleration to a few key factors. First, we did see our clients and prospects show greater willingness to engage and purchase. But second and most importantly, we took action by maintaining our overall investment in sales and marketing, applying our best-in-class inside sales expertise to continue training our field sales force and utilizing innovative demos and other HCM content to start conversations. We've designed a client acquisition funnel that is successful even in the current environment. Our teams delivered across the board. That's everything from the downmarket where RUN continues to grow. And in fact, we've now exceeded 700,000 RUN clients for the first-time surpassing pre-COVID levels to the mid-market, where we're seeing clients showing more interest in fully outsourced HRO solutions to the enterprise space, where we had strong traction in compliance-related solutions. Our international sales were also strong as we closed several larger deals that were previously put on hold as prospects were waiting for a more stable environment to proceed. And our tax rates on many of our solutions continue to increase as well. This quarter, our workforce management solutions also referred to as time and attendance reached the 90,000 milestone for the first-time. And we're pleased to see that continue to grow our revenue. Our revenue outperformance was also driven by stronger retention. We are very proud to report that we hit record employer services retention levels for a Q1 period and our performance likewise experienced \u2013 and our PEO performance likewise experienced stronger than expected retention. While our retention likely benefited from having some clients delayed decisions to switch HCM vendors, given elevated uncertainty, higher client satisfaction clearly contributed as well. You may recall that last quarter we delivered record NPS scores across our businesses. As we helped our clients manage through government programs like the PPP. This quarter, I'm happy to say that across our businesses, we either maintained or reached new record NPS levels. We believe these results show that our commitment to providing outstanding service to our clients is paying off and we'll continue to do so. Combination of stronger bookings and retention in Q1 drove better revenue performance and the high incremental profitability associated with those revenues plus prudent expense management ultimately drove stronger margin performance as well. This is another great example of execution by our associates. And in a few minutes, Kathleen will cover our margin performance in more detail. I'd like to now provide an update on the progress we continue to make in driving innovation. Earlier this month, as part of the annual HR Tech Conference, ADP was given the Top HR Product award. This marks a record-setting six consecutive year that we have been recognized at the conference for breakthrough technology innovations, which is representative of how we remain committed to leading the industry with the premier HCM technology. This year, we were recognized for our Next Gen Payroll engine. And as we highlighted in our February Innovation Day, the benefits of this new engine include a policy-based framework that enables easy self-service and powerful transparency that allows practitioners and employees to more easily understand the effects of regulatory policy or potential life changes and is designed to be scaled globally. We continue to deploy our Next Gen engine to the market and we added another 100 clients during the first quarter. We remain excited about expanding its availability and driving adoption. And the feedback so far has been overwhelmingly positive. Ultimately, we expect a higher level of satisfaction to generate even better retention and higher win rates, supporting our long-term revenue growth trajectory. And we continue to innovate throughout our ecosystem. This quarter, the ADP marketplace reached 500 app listings and we are pleased to offer an expanding suite of offerings as we continue to drive millions of daily API transactions for tens of thousands of clients that are current users. And just this past week, we hosted our Annual ADP Marketplace Partner Summit, where we further strengthened our partner relations and provided actionable ideas to help our partners grow their business. Also earlier in Q1, we released our Return to Workplace solution that helps clients bring their employees back to work safely through a comprehensive set of tools designed to streamline and manage the process. We now have thousands of clients using the Return to Workplace solution, and we expect usage to grow over time as more clients start to gradually bring their employees back to the office or the work site. As I said, we are very pleased with the start of the year. And I'd like to recognize our associates from sales to service implementation and all the others who support them for their continued efforts in outstanding performance during this time. They continue to come through for our clients when it matters most. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kathleen. Kathleen Winters : Thank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. We had a great Q1 with the combination of gradually improving macroeconomic conditions and outstanding execution, driving better sales retention and overall volume. We do expect to continue to face a number of headwinds over the course of fiscal 2021, as the global economy continues to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. But with our strong first quarter, we now see the potential for a better full year outcome compared to our outlook three months ago and our updated guidance reflects this view. For the first quarter, our revenue declined 1% on a reported and organic constant currency basis. Clearly a nice start out of the gate and better than we were expecting three months ago. Better bookings and retention rates were the main drivers of revenue favorability. And that coupled with expense favorability resulted in a year-over-year increase of 120 basis points in our adjusted EBIT margin. As you will recall, we anticipated that first quarter would have a modest acceleration in bookings compared to the previous quarter, but a greater year-over-year revenue decline than we experienced in the previous quarter. And that much of this loss revenue would be at very high margin. Instead, our booking swung to a year-over-year increase, revenues declined only modestly and our margins expanded even with the sales and implementation expense generated by a much stronger than expected bookings quarter. Several factors drove this margin favorability. First, with a more modest revenue decline than expected in Q1, we saw less associated margin pressure than expected. In addition, the better retention we had in Q1 also translated to lower bad debt expense than we had originally contemplated. We also continue to execute our downturn playbook with our entire organization carefully managing headcount and discretionary expenses. And lastly, we make great progress on our digital transformation and expanded procurement initiatives in Q1 and effectively reduced operating expenses and overhead faster than anticipated. We are encouraged by what we've seen so far and are making a modest increase in our expected full year cost benefit from these transformation initiatives. And now expect $150 million in benefit for fiscal 2021 up from $125 million. That revenue and margin performance together drove adjusted EBIT growth of 5%. Our adjusted effective tax rate increased 10 basis points compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2020 to 21.3%, driven by lower tax benefit on excess stock sensation. Our share count was lower year-over-year driven by both share repurchases that took place pre-COVID as well as the resumption of buybacks during the quarter. All of this combined to drive 5% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share to $1.41, a great start to the year. Now, some detail on the segments. For ES, our revenues declined 3% on a reported basis and 3% on an organic constant currency basis. A great result considering this quarter included the effects of a 9% decline in pays per control and a 20% drop in client funds interest revenue, plus the impact from last quarter\u2019s lower booking level. Our client funds balances were down only 7% better than the double-digit decline expected. And that outperformance was driven by the same bookings and retention related factors that supported revenue. The year-over-year decline in average balances continued to be impacted by lower pays per control, lower state unemployment insurance rates, continued payroll tax deferrals amongst some of our clients and the closure of our Netherlands money movement operation in October of 2019. Our average yield for our client funds interest declined by 30 basis points about in line with our expectations in this low interest rate environment. Employer services margin was up 120 basis points for the quarter, well ahead of our most recent expectations, driven by the same factors I mentioned earlier when discussing consolidated results. For PEO also a strong quarter out of the gate, our total PEO segment revenues increased 4% for the quarter to $1.1 billion and average work-site employees declined only 3% to 547,000. This revenue growth and work site employee performance were both ahead of our expectations, driven primarily by better retention and stronger than expected bookings in Q1. Same-store employment at our PEO clients performed in line with our expectations for mid-single digit decline steady from last quarter. Revenues excluding zero margin benefits pass-throughs declined 1%, and in addition to being driven by lower WSEs, it continued to include pressure from lower workers' compensation and SUI costs and related pricing. PEO margin increased 40 basis points in the quarter. This included about a 60 basis points of favoribility from ADP Indemnity pertaining to changes in the actuarial loss estimates. Let me now turn to our updated guidance for fiscal 2021. We are very encouraged by our strong Q1 performance. We are still somewhat cautious about the balance of the year. You'll see that the implied increase in guidance for the next three quarters builds in some ongoing momentum for the balance of the year, but does not anticipate the same level of outperformance we just experienced in Q1. This reflects both our confidence in the fundamental strengths of ADP, as well as a realistic assessment of the lingering uncertainties ahead for the global economy, including uncertainty around the rate of continued economic improvement, the labor participation rate and the timeline for a vaccine. For the details of our outlook, I'll start by updating you on some of our key macroeconomic assumptions. For pays per control, we continue to expect a decline of 3% to 4% for the year. And as we mentioned, pays per control performed approximately in line with our expectations in Q1. We continue to assume a modest pace of improvement from this point, with mid-to-high single digit decline in Q2, improving to a mid-single digit decline in Q3, followed by a mid-to-high single digit increase in Q4 on the easier compare. And as you are aware, the reported BLS unemployment rate has trended better than most people's expectations these past few months. But factors like a reduced labor force participation rate are creating an offset, which is why our pays per control has actually been in line so far. Out-of-business losses outperformed our expectations and contributed to our record Q1 retention levels. We are raising our retention guidance accordingly. While we have seen effectively no incremental pressure so far this year from increased bankruptcies among our clients with continued uncertainty as to further stimulus and strain in parts of the economy remaining from partial shutdowns. We believe it is still prudent to assume some effect from higher out-of-business losses in the coming quarters. On client funds interest, there is no material change to our expectation for average interest rates for the year, though we are revising our balanced growth higher, given the better start to the year with stronger sales and retention. We continue to expect the client funds balances to return to year-over-year growth in Q4. Let's now look at a revised fiscal 2021 guidance. I'll start with ES. We now expect revenue to be flat to down 2% for the full year versus our previous expectation for a decline of 3% to 5%. I'll break that down into some of its components. We now expect our new business bookings to be up 10% to 20% compared to our prior forecast of flat to up 10%. That 10% increase in guidance reflects the impact of our Q1 outperformance, as well as a slight increase in our bookings expectation over the rest of the year. We are still contemplating a modest year-over-year bookings decline in Q2, as instances of partial economic lockdowns in Europe, plus uncertainty from the U.S. election keep us somewhat cautious, but this Q2 outlook is certainly better than what we contemplated three months ago. We now expect our ES retention to be flat to down 50 basis points, versus down 50 to 100 basis points previously. As again we had stronger Q1 retention than expected and believe our strong client satisfaction will translate to continued strong controllable retention, that we continue to assume elevated out-of-business losses in Q2 and Q3. And for our client funds interest, which primarily impacts the results of our ES segment, we are raising our average balances expectation on the strong Q1 sales and retention performance and accordingly raising our client funds interest range by $10 million, now to $400 million to $410 million. We now expect our margin in the Employer Services segment to be down 100 basis points to 150 basis points for the year versus our prior forecast of down 300 basis points, driven by the stronger Q1 performance, a stronger revenue outlook and continued expense discipline. For our PEO, we now expect revenue to be flat to up 3% versus our previous forecast of down 2% to up 2%. And we expect an average worksite employee count down 1% to up 1% versus our previous forecast of flat to down 3%. We continue to expect average work-site employee growth to be negative during the first three quarters and turn positive in Q4. Our revenues excluding zero-margin pass-throughs are expected to be down 1% to up 1% versus our previous forecast of down 4% to down 1%. We continue to expect lower workers' compensation and SUI revenues on a per work site employee basis. For PEO margin, we now expect to be down 50 basis points to flat in fiscal 2021, versus our prior forecast for down 100 basis points, this increase in our guidance is driven by stronger revenues and a more favorable benefit from ADP Indemnity. Moving to our consolidated outlook. We now anticipate total ADP revenue to be down 1% to up 1% in fiscal 2021, versus down 4% to down 1% prior. And we anticipate our adjusted EBIT margin to be down 100 basis points to 150 basis points versus our prior guide of down 300 basis points. As I mentioned earlier, we now expect about $150 million in savings from the combination of our digital transformation, as well as our procurement transformation initiatives. And we will continue to manage our expense base prudently. As we saw in Q1, you should expect that further upside to our revenues, whether from macro-related factors or our own execution should drive upside to our margins as well. In August, we refinanced $1 billion of notes maturing in 2020. And as a result, we will benefit from approximately $5 million in interest expense savings this year. For our effective tax rate, we continue to anticipate 23.1% for the year. We resumed our share repurchases in Q1, and we assume a net share count reduction in our guidance. Net of all these changes, we are raising our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a decline of 3% to 7%, which represents a much more modest decline, compared to our prior guidance of down 13% to 18%. I'd like to wrap up with a few comments on longer-term margins. To be clear, there has been no departure from our focused and consistent approach to continue to drive margins higher over the long-term. Looking beyond fiscal 2021, a continued economic recovery should support employment growth and above normal pays per control growth. And we would expect such a trend to contribute incremental margin uplift to our results, all else being equal. The impact of lower interest rates will also begin to moderate in the coming years. In addition to these macroeconomic factors, we expect our underlying margin performance to continue to be supplemented by our ongoing efforts to transform our organization and client service operations and to be supported long-term by Next Gen platforms that are more efficient and less expensive to maintain. As you have seen from our Q1 results, we are committed to protecting and driving margins, even as we maintain our steady approach to investing for the long-term. We remain confident in our long-term growth prospects and our ability to execute. And I look forward to continuing to update you on our progress. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning and good to see the upgraded guidance. As we entered the critical year end selling season, I hear the caution around factors like partial lockdowns in Europe and the U.S. election. But can you give us some more detailed kind of insight around your expectations for new bookings potentially have RUN, Workforce Now, Vantage and our surveys of your customers pre-COVID, we were hearing a lot of demand for Workforce Now, especially into the bottom of the market up to 4,000 to 5,000 employees per company. Carlos Rodriguez : Yes. I mean, I think that we'd like to be \u2013 given the momentum we just demonstrated, we'd like to be really optimistic, unfortunately, we all watch the same news and the backdrop in terms of these issues, it's not just Europe, I think there are some concerns here in the U.S. as well. And what we saw from April \u2013 March, April May, is that we stick to our story that our clients \u2013 if our clients are hunkering down and are unable to make decisions, it impacts us. So we remain positive because it doesn't feel like there's going to be a full lockdown across the board nationally like there was here in the U.S. last time. And we've clearly adapted, I mean we've \u2013 you can see it in the quarter, how much progress we've made in terms of being able to sell virtually and use online tools and really ramp up our digital marketing and a lot of other things that we can talk about that we've done to adjust our salesforce. But for us to tell you what our view is of RUN and Workforce Now and enterprise sales in the next two or three months, honestly is difficult other than to stick to our story around our guidance, which is really more about the full year and couching it in optimistic, positive and good execution terms, but also with some level of caution, because we're still dependent, I think on the healthcare situation and to some extent on the economy as well. One of the questions that you're not \u2013 you didn't ask, but I'm sure people are wondering is about this \u2013 question is stimulus. And that's another one that I wish we could tell you that we have kind of a scientific placeholder in our forecast around how much stimulus and whether there is stimulus or not and we don't \u2013 but that's another factor that I think would just create the kind of overall picture that would either be supportive or not supportive of our sales efforts, because clearly if you look at the last 20, 30 years of ADP, there is some general correlation between GDP and our sales results, our new business bookings. And that is impacted by not just the economic activity related to the healthcare crisis but also to things like stimulus, because obviously the government can offset down pressure on the economy, through stimulus as it just did, but there is also uncertainty around that as well. So I wish I could give you a more concrete, one thing I can tell you for sure is we're maintaining our sales investment, we're maintaining our optimism and we are gradually getting some people back into the field in terms of selling. And we're certainly pivoting in a big way in terms of using the large resources we already had with inside sales to really train a lot of our traditional field sales to be able to sell virtually. And I think you saw a great execution and great results in the quarter as a result of that. Kathleen Winters : I'd just add one other thought here or comment here. In addition to what Carlos said, I mean, look, obviously we're very encouraged and we're optimistic because of the great outperformance in Q1. But as you heard us say, we're very cautious because of the various uncertainties that we mentioned. But I would also say, we're cautious because as we look back in history and as we look at how in other recessions, how we recovered from that. We do see a period of chopping as it's not all kind of a straight line up in terms of the recovery during the great financial recession after that, we had I believe it was six quarters of negative sales growth after that and it was quite choppy actually. So we're expecting there to be some choppiness here as well. So I just wanted you to be aware of that. David Togut : Understood. As a follow-up, how do you see the current economic environment affecting the case for outsourcing of payroll and HR services? In other words do the economic challenges that businesses face make them want to focus more on their core business and outsource payroll and HR services? Carlos Rodriguez : Yes. I mean, I think that's safe to assume that we would probably be on the side of the ledger of businesses that would benefit \u201cunder normal circumstances post pandemic\u201d. So in other words, once we get through the transitory nature of the challenge, I don't see how it's not a positive backdrop for companies like ADP and outsourcers who help people, first of all, maintain business continuity, and second of all, focus on their core business as you imply. So I think it has to \u2013 again, but we have \u2013 what do we \u2013 how many points of growth is that, only history will tell, but we think it will \u2013 we think it\u2019ll be a positive. David Togut : Understood. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Lisa Ellis : Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. Wow, the recovery in bookings is pretty fantastic. I know you provided a little color around using your inside sales to train your outside sales. Can you just even provide a little, like, what is your sales model looking like right now? To what extent are you using kind of digital marketing and digital onboarding? Can you just give a little bit more color around kind of what happened and what changed over the course of the three months to drive that recovery? Carlos Rodriguez : Sure. I'm not sure that the call is long enough though to be able to give you all that, because one of the differences between us and some of our competitors, which I would see it as a positive, if I were all of you, is that we're very diversified both geographically and also across segments. So the answer unfortunately is complicated and it goes area-by-area. So in international for example, we're very happy with very strong results versus expectation, but also frankly, very strong results versus the prior year. But there were a few larger deals there, I think there were few global view deals that helped. And when you look at the core best of breed, like in-country solutions, we also outperform there versus expectations, but not as well in terms of versus the prior year, which is obviously understandable given the pandemic. So that's international. And then you move to the U.S. and the story in a downmarket is different and the midmarket is different than the upmarket. Although across the board, we were better than expected. But the growth year-over-year varied, because I think that's the biggest surprise, which we're frankly very excited about is that we have positive growth. But if you decompose it, it's a different story in each area. And we had tailwinds in the downmarket, I think as result of some big recovery that was probably some pent up demand, the PPP loans probably frankly saved a lot of small businesses and provided a lot of cash to small businesses to continue to kind of run their businesses and make decisions around purchasing solutions like what we provide to help them run their business better. So it really \u2013 by the way, our upmarket was also good and strong. So that was very encouraging the midmarket I think performed also better than our expectations. So I wish I could give you a simple answer. I personally see it as a positive, because if it was one thing that we could point to, I think it would be problematic because that could easily change overnight, but there really isn't, it's just a lot of execution across the board. I do think that we got a little bit of help, again, we don't have a scientific way of estimating it, but I've been consistent in the nine years that I've been in this job, because of knowing our culture and how we operate, the fact that our fiscal year ended where it did, we clearly had a little bit of pent up demand from call it May, June that carried over into July. I would say that, that was somewhat minor in this case, because getting companies to make decisions on your timeline is probably not as easy to do now as it has been in prior years. But historically when we have a bad year, we get off to a good start. And in some segments that didn't affect probably international business, didn't affect the downmarket, because the downmarket doesn't really have that ability to kind of hold off on something and started in the next fiscal year. But may have had a little bit of an impact. But we're pretty convinced that that's not a major story, but I thought I was important for me to be consistent, because I've been saying that for nine years, by the way, likewise, we have a blowout fourth quarter, we end up usually struggling at the beginning of the next fiscal year. Lisa Ellis : Okay. And then for my follow-up, I know you called out the payroll engine and adding 100 additional clients this quarter. Can you just remind us or update us on sort of where you are in that overall rollout and what the kind of rate and pace of that is? Carlos Rodriguez : So I think we have a total of a couple 100 clients, and I would describe that as still are very early compared to ADP\u2019s size. So if we were a startup, you'd be really excited. And I think we have a $20 billion market cap right now with only 200 clients, given what I've been seeing in the market. But the reality is that relative to ADP size and given our profile as a company and so forth, you got to take it in context, but we can't help, but be excited, because two years, three years, five years, 10 years down the road, it's going to be a big difference maker. I think it is, and that was our plan, when we built the business case, we've been at it for three or four years, this is a global scalable new payroll engine, it's incredibly exciting in terms of what it's going to do in terms of feature functionality, and hopefully client satisfaction, but also cost to maintain, cost to develop. But as you know, we have approximately 800,000 clients, sorry, 900,000, that's not fair because RUN, this has nothing to do with RUN. But a large portion of ADP's business is still on our current versions of our payroll engine, which by the way, all of these payroll engines are transparent to the clients. I don't know if any of you guys understand that, but Workforce Now and Vantage and Lithion, and all of our products are the front ends are really what our clients experience. And it's just important to remember that this is not like the transitions we had with Workforce Now, or even with RUN, because this is a gross to net engine that is really kind of underneath the hood, if you will of what the clients are experiencing on the front end. So that's positive too, because we don't anticipate a major migration effort, if you will, when we get to that, which is still at some point in the future. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. Thank you. Nice job. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Tien- tsin Huang : Thanks so much. Good morning, really terrific new sales results. Just to add to what Lisa asked at the beginning there, just thinking about ROI on your sales investments. Did you lean in really hard in this quarter there, and I'm sure everyone was motivated to drive sales, but could we see more return on some incremental investments as you go throughout the fiscal year? I was trying to understand the timing of some of the investments you put in place, and also if there is any call-outs on pricing on new deals, especially on the enterprise side. Kathleen Winters : Yes. So on the sales investment, what I would say is maybe think about two big buckets in terms of investment from a headcount perspective and continuing to invest in marketing and digital marketing. The headcount investment, we kind of try to do that on a very steady pace over time, and that's been consistent with how we've thought about it and approached it. It was somewhat modest headcount investment in Q1 and that will ramp up during the course of the year, we're planning to continue to focus on and do that. And for sure have committed funding and resources, if you will from a digital marketing perspective to help support the bookings. Tien- tsin Huang : Terrific. And then on pricing, anything \u2013 any call outs there? Carlos Rodriguez : No. It's really \u2013 we really don't see any \u2013 I'm sure I know we did and I think some of our competitors did things to try to help our clients. And even in some cases prospects like there was a couple of examples of people giving away like three free months. And I think one competitor was doing six free months, et cetera. But \u2013 and one competitor changed their pricing online, but then changed to back a couple months later. So I would say there is nothing to report. There is really very little change in the pricing environment. This is not \u2013 I don't think this is really a question of pricing. I don't think you can impact end demand in a significant way in this environment through that, that would not be \u2013 certainly would be our view, that\u2019s not how to drive growth. Tien- tsin Huang : Great to hear. Just my quick follow-up, just on PEO and sort of the sales outlook there, given some of the same caution and uncertainty with the election and maybe insurance. Do you \u2013 are you more bullish or less bullish on PEO here as we go into the second quarter here versus 90 days ago? Carlos Rodriguez : I'm always bullish on the PEO. I was born in the PEO. And as you know, so the \u2013 I think the \u2013 as usual my answer has to be, if you look at the short-term, we have a lot of pressure in some parts of our business because of the healthcare situation. And the question is, do you want to look through that or do you want to stay focused on us, for example, in the PEO when you have clients shrinking, we from a discipline standpoint have some rules around that can sometimes affect \u2013 create adjustments, if you will, in our sales results, it puts pressure in the short-term on the sales results i.e., call it audits if you will. So if a client was sold and was valued at $1,000 and 12 months later, they're now valued at $900 because they're paying fewer people than we're collecting less revenue, which as you can imagine is happening with the majority of our clients that affects our PEO sales results. So I\u2019d say that the fact that workers\u2019 compensation, prices and costs have come down, which is part of the revenue picture, there is a lot of short-term transitory things. But I would say on a unit basis, our results were very good in the quarter. And we\u2019re very happy with that. And I would say that again, if there is any businesses that are going to be even more from a pure positioning standpoint, stronger coming out of the pandemic, the comprehensive outsourcing businesses, which PEO is one of them should be very compelling value propositions, because, as people look back a year or two from now, they might be thinking, I really don't want to go through that again. I don't want to be figuring out how to process, forget about payroll, because that \u2013 we have that covered. But most people \u2013 a lot of our clients do not use us for health benefits, processing or management of open enrollment, they don't use us for time and attendance, they don't use us for workers' compensation and our comprehensive solutions take care of the entire picture. And I think if you're a small and mid-sized business, if I were you, I'd be thinking about making that change, maybe not right now, because you've got other things that you're focused on, but I think six to 12 months from now, I would expect people to be seriously considering any options they have to deal with multiple things that are very critical to the ongoing operations and to their employees, but they may not have thought of pre-pandemic. Tien- tsin Huang : Got it. I was going to get you on the phone and start selling them. Thank you for that update. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Your line is open. Mihir Bhatia : Hi, this is Mihir on the Jason. Thank you for taking our questions. Maybe I can just follow-up a little bit on bookings. If you could maybe just talk a little bit about trends you saw in a F1Q and what you're seeing even now, I guess, between small, medium and large. Anything different worth calling out that we should be considering? And then just relatedly on booking. Was there any negative booking adjustment in the F1Q booking numbers? Carlos Rodriguez : I'm sorry, negative adjustment in which Q? Mihir Bhatia : In the booking number this quarter \u2013 like in terms of booking number this quarter? Carlos Rodriguez : No. We had a minor \u2013 I would say we had a minor, we talked about last quarter that we had taken some reserves because we expected to have \u2013 obviously clients that were going to cancel their orders and so forth to abuse laypersons terms. And I think that's exactly what happened. And I think our \u2013 we did reverse some of that reserve, but it was actually very much in line with the actual client. We had identified, we didn't do this kind of at a very high level. We had specific clients when we booked that reserve in our \u201cbookings\u201d, we had identified a list of clients that we thought were probably going to cancel in this first quarter. And I believe the two things\u2026 Kathleen Winters : Yes, and so we utilized \u2013 we basically utilized a portion of that reserve, which is a normal course of how it happens. I guess Q4 was just an outsized amount for that, we call it the backlog adjustment. It's just outside obviously because of the COVID impact and a portion of that was utilized in Q1, but nothing significant other than that. Carlos Rodriguez : I think it's safe to say it would not have made a difference. I mean, it clearly would've made a difference if we hadn't had the \u2013 but if you want to know what our gross bookings performance was, it was not affected by our gross bookings performance, it did not affect our gross bookings performance. You would have had basically the same picture. Mihir Bhatia : Understood. And then just any trends between, just small, medium or large businesses, what you were seeing this quarter? Carlos Rodriguez : Other than noise, I think we \u2013 probably the strongest performance was in the downmarket because much to everyone's surprise, there is strong business formation. And we saw that as kind of \u2013 we talked about that in our last call, remarkable recovery in small business very quickly at the beginning of the pandemic, both in terms of pace for control in kind of all categories, including this kind of new business formation. And I would probably add a note of caution there that to me is counterintuitive, and whenever in my career I've seen something that doesn't make sense, it generally \u2013 I think there is probably a little bit of payback at some point, I'm hoping I'm wrong, because if there is a relatively quick solution to the healthcare crisis, it's possible if the government managed to get small business through this relatively unscathed through PPP and all the other things that they've done. But in general it's a counterintuitive kind of situation. But we'll take it, it was positive. Kathleen Winters : Yes. The other areas where we saw some particular strengths, and I think we mentioned already on the international side, particularly Canada was very strong for the quarter and also our compliance services area. So things like employment verification, unemployment claims, things like add more compliance of services related stuff saw a very strong performance in the quarter. Carlos Rodriguez : Yes, it\u2019s a great point. Like we don't always talk about some of these businesses that we have that are very good businesses, we call them standalone businesses. And we did have some good tailwinds from some of those businesses quarter. But again, I would tell you that they don't change the overall picture, but important to note that those were helpful. Mihir Bhatia : Understood. And then just, if I could follow-up real quick on your EBIT margin guidance, you had a pretty nice raise in the guidance. And I was just wondering how much of that is driven by the stronger top line outlook versus changes in your expectations by expenses. I know you mentioned an extra $25 million in transformation savings, but were there other factors because it doesn't look like, it's just float income didn\u2019t change all that much. So anything else if you could give us there? Thank you. Carlos Rodriguez : I would say it's safe to assume that most of it is as a result of that. But that I don't want to take away from us in terms of our execution, because, if we have higher revenue, we also frankly have more clients more employees to pay. So to the extent that we believe we can hold the line on expenses, some companies, you have to cut expenses, in our case, we just have to hold the line and that's probably good news, but I would say that mathematically you're on the right track, which is \u2013 that's a big factor. The incremental revenue is \u2013 a lot of it is flowing to the bottom line and helping our margins. Kathleen Winters : Yes, definitely that incremental high margin revenue is the biggest contributor, but also, as we said look, we've been really focused on making sure we're doing a good job on cost control. We're keeping a close watch on headcount. We talked about investment in sales, but other than sales we're really controlling everywhere else from a headcount perspective. Very tight on discretionary costs, transformation work is coming along very nicely. We did a little bit better with the higher retention, better on bad debt expense in Q1. We think we're cautious about that because we think it could come and hit us in Q2 and Q3. So we've built that into our expectation. But those were the contributors. Mihir Bhatia : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Your line is open. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi, good morning. And thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the contribution to bookings performance of delayed, kind of bookings getting realized this quarter versus sort of net new bookings. I'm just trying to understand the contribution from maybe sort of a backlog of delayed bookings and how material that was. And then also to just understand what it is, sort of a pipeline of these delays that should flow in, kind of continue to flow in as we get a little deeper into the year or was there more of sort of a one-time catch-up that happened in the quarter with some of these delayed deals, does that makes sense? Carlos Rodriguez : I\u2019d say the only place where it's really meaningful and quantifiable is probably in the international space where we had, I think I mentioned a few global view deals that were delayed if you will, but that's actually not a \u2013 I wouldn't call it, that's not something that was in the \u2013 necessarily in the backlog because we hadn't sold it yet. So we don't actually book a sale until it doesn't go into the backlog until we get a contract. And so these were things that were in process, if you will, or in the sales process. And maybe we thought it was going to close in May or June, but by the way, maybe it wouldn't have \u2013 even without a pandemic, like there's really no way to, this is all frankly speculation stuff that we do when we get into these kinds of conversations. But I say that's the place where a field like we had a few large deals that we thought were going to close in the fourth quarter and didn't, by the way, client decisions, not us trying to move them from one quarter to the other. We want to get businesses as fast as we can. So we are always trying to book everything as quickly as we can, but some client delays in the international space, it's really not honestly a factor in the downmarket and very small factor in the mid-market in terms of controllability. We can't really sway our clients that easily from one way to the other. Maybe a little bit of that in the upmarket and in international, but you really can't do that in a downmarket and the mid-market. So I would say, there's a difference between, I guess I'm not sure what the nature of the question is, but I think I already said that there could have been some \u2013 in some segments of our sales force, if you have a terrible year and you're in the last month and you're not going to make the year, there's sometimes the tendency for people to hold and start that business in July. But I think you saw in our comments that August and September were also strong. So it doesn't feel like \u2013 people don't like hold something from May and June, and then book it at the last day of September. They typically put it in the first week of July. And so again, based on my experience and what I've seen here over the years, there was probably a little bit of that didn't make a material difference in the sales results. And it is where it is. We had a great start and I think great execution. And besides us leaning into our sales investments, the really big difference maker here is our sales force leaned in to drive results, right. And we're incredibly grateful to them for that. Ramsey El-Assal: All right, that helps a lot. I appreciate it. And just a quick follow-up on the \u2013 if you could give us an update on the rollout of the Next Gen HCM and the Payroll engines relative to, let's say three months ago or four months ago, how do you think COVID is going to impact the roll out of some of the Next Gen technologies? Is it going to be \u2013 you mentioned some delays, I think previously, but how is it looking now? Carlos Rodriguez : Well, we had \u2013 I think we had a good quarter like \u2013 frankly, if any client to me is a good point. It's good news. And I think we had three or four. I think Danny probably\u2026 Kathleen Winters : That\u2019s right. Yes, we had a couple of them, good sales. Carlos Rodriguez : We had some sales like closed. In other words, we got people to sign contracts in the quarter. Like, I don't know about anybody else, but I'm not spending a lot of contracts in this kind of environment. Like we just \u2013 the whole focus of this call is how we're focused on prudent expense management and trying to keep expenses down. So when people are coming to me, selling me things, I'm generally not a big signer on those types of things. So just shows, I think the value of \u2013 of our value proposition that people are still signing up because I think they believe that it will not only help them in the short-term, but that perhaps it can make them more efficient even in the short-term. So I think that is a good sign, right, of the strength of our products and the solutions and the pitch that we have. But that was good news. I mean, we were pleasantly surprised. Kathleen Winters : And we have several dozen, I think in implementation, active implementations right now. So the sales are continuing, the backlog, the implementations continued to scale up. So really no significant or substantial change in the outlook. Carlos Rodriguez : I think besides the sales, we actually started, I think a number of clients, three or four also. Danyal Hussain : Yes. We're in the double-digits now. Carlos Rodriguez : These are clients \u2013 we actually sold new clients, new contract that are now going to go into the implementation process, but we had clients that were in the implementation process, a few of which delayed starting in the fourth quarter, but then we started them here in the first quarter. So I would say that's all the news. And on Next Gen Payroll, you heard what we said and sold 100, which again, I think is pretty damn good news, like in this kind of environment. Ramsey El-Assal: Agreed. I appreciate your answers. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Wald from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Steven Wald : Great. Thank you. Good morning. So I'd love to come back to the margin. I know some be in over the head, but maybe just a couple of other sort of ways to look at it. It seems like the way you're all looking at it going forward is, if macro cooperates in the higher margin pieces of the revenue could drop to the bottom line and drive incremental upside from here. Is that the right way to think about it? And generally, should we assume that implicit in the remaining three quarters of the year, the lower margin implicit assumption for at least a couple of those quarters is really more dependent on the macro than it is on your piece of investment, which I think we maybe collectively thought was going to be more robust than the headwind relative to what it ended up being this quarter? Carlos Rodriguez : Okay. So just to clarify, remember we outperformed not because we stopped investing or didn't invest as much as we said we were going to invest is because we outperformed on the top line, right. In terms of our revenue, even though some of it was clearly expense management and so forth. But I would say that the answer to that question is that, it's hard to wrap your head around our economic. I know it's hard because most companies don't operate this way, but for example, the better things get in terms of the macroeconomic, the more we're going to invest. And I know that's not going to make some people happy, but like for example, our fourth quarter, like our fourth quarter, like if things play out the way we planned in terms of the original guidances and we're not changing anything on you, but like our fourth quarter where we have easier comps, we would also expect to have great sales results, right. And those great sales results on a comp basis will also bring with them sales expense. And to the extent, we can get some of these clients started and our sales results improved, we're going to start also investing more and stepping on the accelerator and implementation expenses. So this is all carefully planned, carefully controlled as Kathleen was alluding to, like, this is not some kind of free-for-all in terms of expenses, but this is an amazing economic model. I don't know if you can see what we just delivered and what we're telling you that assuming that the situation cooperates with us, we probably will be either flat to slightly up in terms of revenue for the year. So that would mean that, we'll continue our streak of ADP of never being negative revenue growth, which is pretty remarkable, right. We had a massive decline in volume in the last quarter, massive declines in new business bookings. And you see now granted, this is not what we are targeting like, we'd like to have high single-digit revenue growth. So it's kind of weird that we're excited about flat, but it's all about the context and it's all about relativity. So it's really a great economic model, but the economic model is a long-term economic model. You have to invest in sales, implementation, and product to drive the results. This is not \u2013 we're not running the business quarter-to-quarter. And what that means is the minute we see the sunshine \u2013 the sun shining we're going to become boasted. It doesn't mean that our expenses are going to get out of control, but you will see our sales and our implementation expenses gradually come up. And along with that, some point our service expenses as well. But that's great because the most important driver of long-term value of this company is growth. It's not what the margin in next quarter or this year. Steven Wald : I understood. Sorry. Kathleen Winters : Yes, just some more color from my perspective. I mean, I would just say, look, we continue to be, as we always have been very, very focused on growth and efficiency and becoming more and more efficient every day. So we're going to continue to invest where it makes sense for growth and for efficiency. So we talked about sales headcount and continuing to support that investment, investment in product. And we invest in efficiency, all of the digital work that we're doing isn't, it doesn't come for free. You have to make investments to be able to drive that efficiency improvement. So we're focused on all of that and we're going to continue to do that. Danyal Hussain : And Steve, just one last thing to tie it back to our guidance. You're right. Certain macro factors will have an outsized impact for the next two quarters. And so what we've contemplated is pressure in retention and pays per control, both of which come at high incremental margins. If ultimately those come out better than forecasted, as you suggest, they would represent upside to margin. Carlos Rodriguez : There's a few others, like Kathleen mentioned bad debt expense is also something that, frankly has been shocking in the last six months where we've had, honestly like decreases in our bad debt expense, which makes no sense at all. So hopefully that will continue, but we didn't plan for that. I think we didn't roll forward three quarters of lower bad debt expense. Steven Wald : Right. Okay. That's all very helpful. Thank you. And then maybe as my follow up there, I think it was asked a little bit before, but Carlos, you were just talking about it a little bit ago there of just kind of wanting to grow mid to high single-digits. If we rewind the tape back to January and you guys talked about the markets you were in and how you were growing, sort of seemed like the way to think about it was you were generally growing in line with the market. And I think your earlier comments indicated, next few years should be an uptick, but there's going to be choppiness of course. I guess I'm curious how you guys think of ADP's positioning relative to other platforms. And obviously, you had a really strong quarter. But for the last several years, you've seen a lot of other platforms growing, in excess off of much lower basis. I'm just curious how you think about it today versus six months ago versus a year ago. If we are to see this uptick in HCM demand and outsourcing demand, where you feel about ADP's positioning in that market? Carlos Rodriguez : Well, I would answer that question just by saying that we just invested hundreds of millions of dollars in new platforms in our key markets, because we intend to take market share. Steven Wald : Couldn't be clearer than that. Okay, I'll leave it there. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thanks. Hey Kathleen, you talked about kind of out-of-business and the guidance looks like it calls for kind of elevated losses in Q2 and Q3. Did it bottom in Q1 and gets better? And then I guess just along those same lines, can you talk about, is there a way to also frame clients that are maybe still in business, but not processing at this point? So I guess, two different questions, just trying to get a sense of a, where the out-of-business did it bottom Q1 and then improves in Q2, Q3, and then as your way to frame no clients still in business that maybe aren't processing at this point? Kathleen Winters : Yes. So on the first thing, the out-of-business, I would not say it bottomed at all. In fact, we did not see a significant impact from out-of-business in Q1. I think the shoe has yet to drop there is how I would say it. And that's what we are forecasting and guiding that we're going to see some pressure from that in Q2 and Q3. That come in Q2, is there more stimulus that helps support it and we don't see it in Q2 and maybe it doesn't come till Q3, I don't know, but we're planning, I think we're cautious about it. And we're planning to see that pressure in Q3 \u2013 Q2 and Q3, sorry. Carlos Rodriguez : And on your question about clients not processing, we did mention that a number of small businesses restarted in the first quarter but there is still a sizeable chunk of companies that have gone inactive and remain in that state. Danyal Hussain : And to be clear, there's just \u2013 in case there's a misunderstanding there that doesn't have \u2013 it has nothing to do with our business bookings, right. So that affects our revenue and affects our losses to some extent, but this is unrelated to business bookings. Because the word restart might confuse some people. Kathleen Winters : Yes, so higher than it would be in a normal period. It's come down from where it was at the peak in probably April, May, June, it's come down from there, but it's still higher than normal situation. Kevin McVeigh : Got it. And just to wrap that point, Carlos, it's fair to say that, with the stimulus, it probably helped those inactives a little bit that maybe would have fallen into bankruptcy. Is that a fair way to think about it too? Carlos Rodriguez : No question about it. Kevin McVeigh : Cool. And then just real quick, it looks like the midpoint of the revenue guidance for ES is a 300 basis point improvement versus 150 basis point improvement for the PEO, any puts and takes to \u2013 I know it's not one-to-one but is it just kind of the client mix that where you'd seen a little bit more upside on ES as opposed to PEO or just any thoughts around that? Carlos Rodriguez : No. Other than \u2013 that's actually a great question, which we'll go back now and decompose that because we hadn't looked at it that way. At least, I hadn't. But I would say, my instinct would tell me that has more to do with how the operating plan is built than any macroeconomic or other major explanation. So I honestly, I wouldn't read much into that. Kevin McVeigh : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our last question from Mark Marcon from Baird. Your line is open. Mark Marcon : Hey, good morning. And thanks for taking my question. Just with regards to the bookings performance this quarter. To what extent, do you think it was due to the sales force basically recalibrating and being able to get out and getting more at bats, relative to higher batting average. So, in terms of thinking about the win rates, and then I have a follow-up with regards to Next Gen. Carlos Rodriguez : That's a great question. And I have some sense of that from looking at the data right from the quarter. And I would say that our win rates are in line, I think a little bit better in some cases against a few competitors, which makes us very happy. But I would say, there's not a lot to report there that is, I think good news, but consistent if you will, in general. So it's probably more the former, right, which is the at-bats. And you could almost use the \u2013 what I call it, the traffic analogy, right. So ever since the pandemic started, whenever I go out on the roads, I do the traffic check and traffic is much higher and has been much higher over the last two or three months than it was in March and April. And that probably has something to do with, talking to just people on the streets, but people on the streets turn into people buying things and people going to restaurants and people going back to their workplaces and so forth. So I hate to be so crass and so simplistic, but I think that ADP is a very large company, which we're very proud of. And the gravitational pull of GDP and economic activity is strong in both directions. And I think we benefited a lot from, I think it's safe to say better than most people. I mean, I think this is not an ADP issue. I think most economists have raised their expectations about GDP. Unemployment is lower than everyone thought, even though labor force participation is lower. In general, things are better than people thought they were going to be and call it, May, June at this point. And we have benefited from that. I think that's I wish I could take more credit and give you a more complicated answer, but I think that is actually what's happening. The traffic is up for sure. Mark Marcon : Great. And then just a short-term and a long-term question, but the short-term one is basically just as we're here in the key fall selling season, how do you view, Carlos, the kind of the mixed dynamics with regards to, hey, there's more uncertainty there's \u2013 this resurgence with regards to COVID, there's the election, perhaps not a lack of stimulus, but at the same time, things are more complicated. HR is more central. How does that end up impacting kind of the new sales, the bookings expectation, just here in the core selling season. And then the longer term question is Next Gen Payroll, Lifion, they've gotten really nice awards. You've obviously been inhibited by the pandemic in terms of being able to go out there and talk about it with clients. But when things get a little bit back to normal, how would you expect the penetration of those elements to go over the next year, two years, three years? Like when would we see a bigger penetration? So as they've gotten really good rewards. Carlos Rodriguez : Yes, I think on the first part of your question, it's of course \u2013 the last question, of course, has to be the downer question, because I think that that's a hard one for me to, I've been so optimistic the whole call, so I hate to like bring us all down. But based on what I'm seeing right now, both in the U.S. and in Europe. And the fact that this is our key selling season, I wish I could tell you that I'm incredibly excited and bullish and so forth. I just want to get through this damn thing, right. And get out to the other side. And I'm looking forward more to the third and fourth quarter and the fourth quarter and the next fiscal year than I am to the next two or three months, because the combination of the election with, I mean, you guys all see the same thing that we're seeing. And again, got to apply the test of common sense and the test of common sense would tell me that this is a, let's just try to keep us up beat, let's just call it a fluid situation. Kathleen Winters : It's going to be choppy, right. I mean, we thought we'll cover it from the last recession that it was choppy. And I'm fully expecting it's going to be choppy this time around too, particularly right, we're in Q2. We're in the fall, going into the winter, it's cold, we've got areas where there's resurgences that people might be hunkering down again. So Q2 might be challenging, but even in normal situations, normal years, right. Bookings are going to be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. I'd focus more on the full year, the annual and the longer term view. Carlos Rodriguez : And again, of course, we also thought that the first quarter was going to be terrible and it turned out to be home run. So they easily go the other way, but I'm a man, I\u2019m like, I speak the truth, right. In terms of what I know and what I think at the time. And I spoke the truth in our last earnings call, and obviously I was wrong because things turned out to be much better. And I hope that happens here again, but that's my story. And I'm sticking to it, but one quarter or two quarters or three, it's not going to make a difference in ADP's long-term trajectory. What matters is the second part of your question, which is what do we intend to do? And what do we expect in terms of penetration rates and rollout of kind of our Next Gen platforms. And by the way, it's not just about Next Gen, I hope you guys understand that we are making some fairly sizeable investments, ongoing investments in Workforce Now. Workforce Now, now we have a version, if you will, I shouldn't call it a version, but Workforce Now is also on AWS in the cloud. So we've completely rebuilt Workforce Now to be as modern and as Next Gen, as Lifion and as our Next Gen Payroll engine. We also have been doing an enormous amount of work on RUN in the same vein, both at the guts of it in terms of the technology stack, but also on the user experience. You know what the investments we made in data cloud, you know, what we have with ADP marketplace, so this isn't an across the board increase in investment over methodically over the last six to seven years that I just summarize it by saying what I said once before, our intention is to have all of these things parlayed into taking market share and growing ADP faster than market and faster than the economy. Mark Marcon : That's great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today's call. I\u2019m pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos Rodriguez : Well, thank you all of you for listening. Again, in summary, I just want to, once again, I think compliment our associates and our leadership team for incredible execution in the short-term, but I hope you also heard our commitment to the long-term in both in terms of sales, R&D, client service and all the things that drive growth and long-term value for our shareholders. And hopefully, for all of you who represent them. We remain committed to expense management, the digital transformation, all the things that Kathleen said, but we are somewhat holds into obviously the circumstances around the economy and the healthcare crisis. But we remain optimistic that this is \u2013 and it's the reason for optimism, and this is a transitory situation that we're going to get through it, hopefully in the next three or six months to the point where things gradually start to get back to normal. And then ADP can get back to the normal growth rates that we're used to. So thank you again and appreciate, you\u2019re supporting, you're listening to us. And I hope that all of you continue to stay healthy and safe. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Michelle, and I'll be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Second Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there'll be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I'll now turn the conference over to Mr. Danyal Hussain, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Danyal Hussain : Thank you, Michelle. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining ADP's second quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call and webcast. Participating today are Carlos Rodriguez, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Kathleen Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you, Danny, and thank you everyone for joining our call. This morning we reported results reflecting our continued strong business performance and momentum, with our second quarter revenue and margins both outperforming our expectations, as our business continued to demonstrate resilience in the face of ongoing economic headwinds. We reported revenue of $3.7 billion, up 1% on a reported basis and flat on an organic constant currency basis, with adjusted EBIT margin down 30 basis points. Coupled with a slight increase in the effective tax rate versus last year, our share count reduction our adjusted diluted EPS was flat versus last year, much better than the decrease we were expecting. During the second quarter, we continue to see signs of improvement in the overall operating environment, with the positive implications for pays per control, new business bookings and retention. Our pays per control metric performed slightly better than expected, as it improved sequentially to a decline of 6% versus the larger declines we experienced in Q1 in the latter part of fiscal 2020. Underlying employment trends in Q2 were consistent with what we experienced in Q1, with larger enterprises somewhat slower to show improvement, but with small and midsize businesses demonstrating a healthy level of hiring. We performed well on employer services new business bookings. Even though bookings declined 7% this quarter, this was well ahead of our initial expectations earlier this year, and in line with the revised expectations we communicated last quarter. And it's important to point out, that our new business bookings for the first half nearly matched last year's half, despite the very difficult environment. Kathleen Winters : Thank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. Q2 was another strong quarter across every major business metric. While we will still see some pandemic related headwinds for the balance of the year, we are more confident in our outlook given we believe the toughest part is behind us. Our performance thus far into the year reaffirms the resilience of our business model, the strength of our product, and the ability of our sales and service teams to perform even in the toughest of environments. We remain confident in our ability to execute as we move forward. In the second quarter, our revenues grew 1% on a reported basis, flat on an organic constant currency basis, which is significantly better than our expectations coming into the year and better than even the revised expectations we had as of last quarter. Once again, ES retention rates represented favorability as did very strong performance from our PEO. We managed expenses prudently, while making important incremental growth and productivity investments and delivered margins that were better than our expectations. Our adjusted EBIT was down just 1% despite pressure from a decline in client funds interest. Our adjusted effective tax rate increased 20 basis points, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Our share count was lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases. And as a result, our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.52 was flat versus last year second quarter. Moving on to the segments. For ES, our revenues declined 1% on a reported basis, and 2% on inorganic constant currency basis, representing continued sequential improvements driven by record level retention, and the more modest 6% decline in pays for control versus 9% last quarter. Client funds interest declined 23%, as average yield declined 50 basis points versus last year. Operator :  We'll take our first question from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Your line is open. Bryan Bergin : Hi, good morning. Thank you. I'll ask two upfront here. So first on bookings, can you talk about composition of bookings in 2Q versus 1Q? And give us a sense if you can dissect the strongest and weakest demand across client size? And then, just looking at the SG&A level this quarter, can you comment on the drivers of the sequential dollar growth there? I heard the comments on accelerated investment. Is that primarily sales force headcount addition or other areas of spend? Carlos Rodriguez : Sure, let me take the - I'll take the bookings maybe and I'll let Kathleen talk about the SG&A. On the bookings, and I think some of this is just the lumpiness if you will of the results, because there's no - there are a couple of things that happened but it's hard to call it a trend right, because we only have really two quarters if you will of post-pandemic results. But in essence, our mid-market business performed a lot better. So, workforce now and the mid-market business did much better in this quarter than in the last quarter. And then, if you remember, last quarter we talked about that we got some help from our international business and in particular we called out multinational deals, and that was I'm not sure we gave any color around that, but that was strong double-digits is the way I would put it, last quarter helped the last quarter's growth. And this quarter it was kind of slightly negative. Now in the context of what's happening in Europe, which really started to shut down and started to have challenges before the U.S. in terms of the resurgence of the virus, we're pretty happy with that. Like we're pretty proud of our sales teams over there that they were able to accomplish what they did in the second quarter, but sequentially it was not as strong as the help we got in the first quarter. We also had really strong bookings in the first quarter in our down-market business, we had some, what I would call modest help from some - what we call client conversions or we call client-based acquisitions, which we do on a regular basis, but they don't come in every single quarter, so we got a little bit of help from that. And I think I also mentioned last quarter, I think I've been doing this for nine years mentioning that whenever we have a strong finish to a year, we typically get off to a slower start. And the opposite is also true, when we have a really bad year, we tend to get off to a stronger start. A lot of our business is counted at the time of sale and start, but some of our businesses, as you know, like in the up market, there is some flexibility if you will in the sales force. We don't necessarily endorse that, but there is some flexibility for salespeople to book something in call it July versus in May. And because of the way the incentives work and so forth, sometimes we get a little bit of movement from sales into the next fiscal year, if we have a bad fiscal year and the opposite is also true. We'll have a strong fiscal year. We tend to have a hard time getting started in July. But I think we've been - so this is nothing new. We've been I think transparent, giving you all the kind of the color that we can around bookings. I will tell you that when we cut through all that, so we're trying to look at no different than you would do with for example, earnings, where we trying to see what's the core business doing excluding client funds interest, what's happening with the core business excluding pressure from pays per control. We do the same thing in bookings, like what's happening in the core underlying bookings. And we see very positive momentum there, in terms of lead generation, digital leads coming in activity by the sales force. So we're optimistic that the momentum will continue into the third and fourth quarter. Of course, the caveat being, the virus has to cooperate in terms of and the vaccine rollout has to continue to stay on track. But I think overall, if you cut through all the - it's not fair to call them onetime items, but if you cut through all the noise, our momentum in the second quarter, in terms of bookings was stronger than it was in the first quarter, even though it might not be what the reported number shows. And I'll let Kathleen talk about the SG&A. Kathleen Winters : Sure. So on the SG&A side, I mean, you do have a lot of things within that SG&A. But I would think about it this way. The overall view or picture is that from a selling standpoint, I'll talk about kind of full year, and then we can talk about linearity. But from an overall standpoint, we continue to invest in sales, as we've mentioned, and that is both headcount investment, as well as continuing to look at marketing investment and doing some of that. So you've got that investment in sales, but you've also got the work we're doing around transformation, which would be offsetting that investment, as well as just discretionary cost control that we're very focused on doing as well. So kind of overall, you've got investment, headcount and marketing, you've got transformation work that we continue to do, and discretionary cost control. That does change if you look at or not change, but the SKU first half the second half is a little bit different, as we do have significant bookings growth in Q4, our expectation, and so of course, that's going to result in higher Q4 selling expense for us. Bryan Bergin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Bryan Keane : Hi, guys. Good morning. Just want to make sure I understood, the employee service bookings for the quarter came in line with expectations, but you guys did decide to raise the full year. So just want to make sure I understand the pipeline, the visibility there that's causing that raise. And then on retention to record levels. Are you seeing anything in particular on the competition front that is having less of an impact in years past that's driving the higher retention? Thanks so much. Carlos Rodriguez : Sure. On a pipeline question, we do have some visibility. But some of this is really about extrapolating momentum, because in the down market, it's really more about headcount and productivity than it is about pipeline or as in the M&C in the up market. I mean, I'm not telling you anything you wouldn't be able to figure out yourself. So we have a fair amount of visibility in some part of our business, but in other parts of our business, we based on our experience about productivity metrics and headcount and so forth, we have confidence, obviously, in the guidance that we're giving and the raise, otherwise we wouldn't be giving it. But, as couple of things that have changed since last quarter, last quarter we had - what we thought was much better results than we had expected, and we thought we had positive momentum and then on top of that, now we have a vaccine rollout. So that was not something that was it was talked about. But this is now a reality. We also had an election that was still in front of us and that's been resolved. We also thought and people speculated there would be more stimulus and now there is, even though there's even more stimulus being debated, just as a reminder, there was a $900 billion stimulus package that was approved. So I think if you look at what we try to do, we try to do a little bit of kind of correlation, regression, whatever you want to call it, between GDP and economic growth and our bookings, because we do believe there is some connection there. Like there's other things like the training of our sales force, the tools they have, the quality of the sales force, the turnover. But GDP is a powerful force and the GDP numbers are looking pretty strong here on a go forward basis, with perhaps the exception by some of our analysts out there of our third quarter, the quarter we're in right now. But if you look at fourth quarter, our fourth quarter or the first half of next fiscal year for us and then the next calendar year after that, I mean, even this full calendar year GDP expectation has been raised, I think, across the board by everyone. So I think it's partly visibility and pipeline and partly our experience that we know, for example, what a reasonable expectation is for productivity per DM per sales rep. We know how many sales reps we have, we know how many new ones we're hiring. We know what we're generating in terms of leads and digital marketing. And I think we put that all together and that comes out to our guidance. And so I think we're confident in it and we're actually very excited and positive that we were able to do that. And we're just glad that things are looking much better than they were last quarter and certainly better than they were looking in March and in April. On the\u2026 Kathleen Winters : Bryan, if I could just interject the only other detail I'd add on all of that data that Carlos mentioned that we do look at an ongoing basis, is that when we look at the leading indicators in terms of the data we have, so appointments, referrals, demos, opportunities created, as you know, our sales team are inputting leads into the system. All of those are trending better going into the second half than they were before going into the year. And so we're feeling really very optimistic, as you can tell from the raised bookings guidance. We're feeling optimistic going into the second half of the year. In particular the digital leads are up significantly. So, again, just wanted to provide that transparency for you. Carlos Rodriguez : And then on the on the retention side, I would say there's probably two data points that I would look at. The retention obviously is incredibly strong and it's going to be record retention for the year, assuming we have the guidance that we've just provided. We've never been at these retention levels. And I think there's a number of factors. I mean, I think our product set is much stronger and it's not just the products themselves, but it's our commitment to moving our clients onto our newer platform. So we have a lot more clients on newer platforms today than we had a year ago, two years ago, whether a quarter ago or a year ago, it's just a continuing progression that we've talked about now for many, many years. But we've made a lot of progress and we know that the retention on our new platforms is higher than on some of our older platforms. So that's helping. There's probably some tailwind from this pandemic related, we just can't put our finger on it. The clients are maybe not moving as much. But if you look at each business unit, like, for example, in our down market, the retention in our down market as a result of better product and better execution has been going up for probably six or seven years and is up almost 500 basis points pre pandemic, and that's gone up even more. So the fact that we've had this positive momentum in the down market, it's a similar story and Workforce Now, if not 500 basis points. But in the mid-market, we've also had three years of improving retention pre pandemic. So I think those are signs that there is something happening in terms of our execution and our product. So, execution is part of it as well, we have to deliver I think on the commitments we make to our clients to resolve issues for them, and answer questions and so. So, it's a combination of better service, excellent service and really better products and migrating clients, I think is helping. And then secondly, the other data point that I would point to which is really on the bookings side, a combination of bookings and retention that our balance of trade is improving with several of our major competitors for the first time in a while. I think, it's again, related to this effort that we've made to improve product, continue to deliver great service,  on execution. And I think it's showing up now in some of these balance of trade numbers we're showing some improvement. So, the reason I bring that up is because balance of trade with the combination of what we're bringing in, in terms of from some of our competitors but also what we're losing to those same competitors. That's why we call it balance of trade. So, there's a number of metrics that would tell me that our competitive position is getting better, and then resulting obviously in higher retention and hopefully also growing booking here in the future. Bryan Keane : Helpful. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Silber of BMO. Your line is open. Jeff Silber : Thanks so much for taking my question. Two-part question, first is on pricing. I believe it was last quarter maybe the quarter before you talked a little bit about some of your competitors offering some pricing concessions declines. I'm just wondering if that's been continuing. And as a follow-up, I'm just wondering if you're seeing any diverging trends by geography, especially in certain areas where we're seeing higher COVID cases? Thanks. Carlos Rodriguez : So, let me take the second one first on divergence. Yes, we would see what we would expect to see, because we are, I think, we're big enough that we kind of really escape again the gravitational pull of overall GDP, but also of specific geographic challenges. So, in Southern California for example, we did see some challenges in terms of our bookings in the down market and into the mid-market there. It's still impressive if we were able to sell as much as we did. As a footnote, we sold a lot of the say that we're flat, almost flat for us, it's at least, we're impressed with ourselves that our bookings are flat for the first half of the year versus last year. But there clearly are pockets of challenges. Southern California would be a challenge, the Midwest was and the Central part of the country was incredibly challenged for several months. But we had other places that things were better as a result of maybe more economic activity, or continuing opening regardless of the controversy around that. And then, again, Europe would be a place where I would call out where I think we started to encounter some real headwinds. So, the geographies were up and not just about U.S. it's also global. So, the answer is yes, and that you should assume that we would be impacted by whatever you're seeing in the news. And so, when you have hard lockdowns in very large metropolitan markets, that would affect us but fortunately, we're very diversified geographically and across segments. So, remember, we operate all the way from small to up market to international and so, we obviously we try to find a way to keep follow these things in balance, and have something helping us, when other things maybe working against us. So, we did see some of that volatility as you described. On the price side, so one of the things we did talk about last quarter, we did talk about competitors and what we heard anecdotally about competitor pricing action, but we also said last quarter that we didn't get any help from price last quarter. We did get a little bit of help. It was not significant but all around, I think was around 30 basis points of help, which is about normally what we would be getting and to the revenue growth help from price. And so, I think what tells you this, what we're trying to signal to you there is to tell you that it was appropriate for us to pause for call it, four to five months our normal price increases. By the way, our normal price increases would have been July 1st would have been one of the main times that we do price increases. And remember, our price increases are much more modest than they were five, 10 years ago. But at our scale, it does matter. But we delayed those price increases. It was not appropriate if you do that given the circumstances that we were under. But you fast forward to September, October, we felt that given the additional services that we were providing. So we're providing a number of incremental services at no additional cost to our clients that I believe our competitors are not providing. And so we thought that going back to our normal modest price increases was a reasonable thing to do and we did that. And you can see the impact on retention which has been none. And so that would be I think a good sign for us. Jeff Silber : All right. That's great to hear. Thanks so much for the color. Operator : Our next question comes from Pete Christensen of Citi. Your line is open. Pete Christensen : Good morning. Thanks for the question. Nice trends here. Carlos, given the lifted view on ES bookings and retention, how would you characterize some of the trends you're seeing in the tax rate for additional - add-on modules, those sorts of things? And how should we think about the runway for the next two or three quarters? And how you see that evolving particularly with some of your new R&D developments, new product and all that? Carlos Rodriguez : It's a great question, because there's still a lot of room for us there. We're very focused on market share and new unit growth. But we don't mind additional share of wallet and additional tax rate, because that's helpful too. And as you know, our bookings have generally been balanced for many, many years, about half of it coming from new logos, and half of it coming from incremental attach. So we love that business. I happen to be looking at those figures last night and it obviously varies by business unit. But as an example, in the mid-market, we're kind of in the 60% to 70% range, in terms of a tax rate for things like workforce management, which we used to call time and labor management, and benefits administration. And we have things like data cloud and other items that we can attach as well. But I think the best color to put on that is that there's still a lot of room. I mentioned how we are doing well, not just in our new strategic platforms, but we're also doing well on some of our products that we don't always talk about a lot on these calls like retirement services, insurance services where those tax rates are very low in comparison to what I think is the potential for our client base. Because when you have a tightly integrated solution, it really is a much better experience for our clients. So it's good for us, but it's also good for our clients, which is always an important thing. So I guess the color I would put there is we've got really good tax rates on some of the core HCM modules, like workforce management, then admin. So HR payroll, then admin, workforce management, those are kind of the core talent management is a place where we've been seeing growing tax rates, and there's a lot of room still there for people to adopt those solutions. So, we're very optimistic and this is a key strategy for - I think my predecessor before that, which has been great for us that we have a very broad industry. Part of our reason for concentrating on HCM and focusing the company away from some of the other businesses we have like a brokerage business, and dealer services and so forth is this is a growing robust space globally, and there's plenty of room to grow. We definitely want to still focused on  off of market share and logo growth. But there's an enormous opportunity for us in terms of incremental tax rate. Pete Christensen : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is open. Samad Samana : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe stepping back for a big picture question a little bit in a time machine. But if I think back to the Analyst Day in 2018 and some of the company's key initiatives around the service alignment and taking costs out of the business, and getting to call it mid-20s EBIT margin. I guess aside from the world being very different with what happened with COVID. But I'm curious Carlos if you could just think as far as those initiatives went and getting the margin structure of the business toward that. Would you say that were ex what happened with rates and what COVID? Would we be in that shape today? And I guess, maybe thinking forward, how should we think about the structural margins of this business post recovery? And can it be at those long-term levels that we talked about before? And then I have one follow-up. Carlos Rodriguez : Yes. Let me give you a little bit of color on that, because, again, incidentally, I was doing my homework last night. So I did go back that's something that I actually have fresh on my mind. And then will correct me if I'm wrong. But I think our margin in '18, which you would have seen in that Analyst Day, was 20.7. And we're now, I think, forecasting for fiscal year '21, I'm not sure that we're forecasting it, but I think you can extrapolate based on our guidance. I'll just throw out a number. So call it 22.3, 22.5 somewhere in that range for fiscal year '21. That's with a significant drag from client funds interest, as you mentioned, and some drag from COVID as a result of slower than we would have thought or would have expected revenue growth. So I would say that on the margin side, we would be well ahead of what we talked about at Analyst Day, excluding these items. On the revenue side, clearly, we're not anywhere near that, hence why we had to withdraw that three-year guidance we had provided, because obviously the COVID headwinds with what happened with pays per control and just the economy in general made it very difficult. But again, it feels like this is a transitory event, as we've talked about now for two or three quarters, painful, devastating for many people, for our country, for the economy and for the world. But it is transitory and not an existential threat. And so we expect to get right back on the track that we were on before. And I happen to think that the fact that we're a couple hundred basis points higher in margin, even with everything that's happened than we were in '18, I think tells you something about the structural margin opportunity in the business. But, clearly a very important part of that picture is growth. We need to grow the business long-term, because growth does require investment and so you should be hearing from us as we care about margin and we think there's opportunity in terms of structural margins here going forward, but the most important thing we can do to drive long-term shareholder value here is to also grow the top-line. And we're focused on that. Danyal Hussain : Just to clarify, Samad, our formal margin expectation is 22.0% to 22.5%. Samad Samana : Great. Thanks, I appreciate. And that's why I asked it. To us, it sounds like the business is healthier adjusting for non-controllable factors. And maybe just as a follow-up on that on the booking in this quarter and just as you think about bookings for maybe the next couple of quarters. When you think about the performance, is there a way to think about it, in terms of driven by field reps versus digital inbound through marketing? Are there channels, so not by customer size, but are there channels that are doing better or worse in terms of bringing more customers into the top of the funnel, and driving new bookings? Carlos Rodriguez : Yes, I think I'll tell you what\u2026 Kathleen Winters : Maybe I'll just interject on before Carlos response to that one, and I want to interject and just follow-up a little bit on the margin story, because Carlos gave a really good kind of recap and summary of the last couple of years. When you think about, we're in the 20% margin, 20.7% to pre-COVID 23% with the various big initiatives that we pursued, and you've heard us talk about that over time. But I want to add that, one of those really important initiatives that we are now working very hard, is digital transformation which has been helping us, right. As we look at our transformation initiatives, we've talked about digital and procurement really driving a lot of the benefit, kind of today if you will, a lot of that procurement does get harder as you go, but from a digital transformation perspective, that's an initiative that we believe is going to be with us for some period of time, because these projects are not fast projects to execute, they do take time to execute, and so we're optimistic that we have got a pipeline of projects and that we will continue to yield benefits for us. Carlos Rodriguez : Yes, and I think that, I'll just pile on to that. Your comment I think earlier after you asked question and you summarize my comments, the business is definitely performing much better than it looks, because we have, these client's funds interest headwind is not just the headwind on margin, it's a headwind on revenue growth as well. So almost a 4 percentage point. And as an example on a margin impact, our margin I think in ES would have been up and ADP overall, our margin would have been up 40 basis points instead of down 30 basis points for the quarter. So, clearly on a margin side, the picture is clouded and that picture will and the interest rate go up and down as you know, and everyone is always convince that rates are going to stay low forever, or they're going to stay high forever depending on where they are. But we believe that at a minimum that headwind will abate unless interest rates continue to go down and then turn negative for the next 10 years, which is very unlikely as we all I think, as we all know, at least in the U.S. that's unlikely. On your question about bookings, one thing that's important to note is we do have record leads through digital marketing coming in. So we have increased our investment in digital marketing, but we're very careful to do that to make sure that we're getting the proper ROI. But that is something that is certainly helping our sales force. But really the message for our sales force is that we want them to meet our client, the clients and the prospects where they want to be met. And they have all the tools, all modern tools that any sales force uses. I mean, the reality is, I said this before people steal our sales force. And so we have to understand we have the best sales force in the industry, there's no question about it, and they have all the tools they need to compete effectively. And they had obviously moved to being mostly a virtual sales force over the last six months. And we make sure they had the tools to be able to do that and that's where clients want it to be met. And if in six months, we anticipate that some of our up market and multinational clients will be okay having some digital meetings or virtual meetings, but they might want to have people visiting some of them again, we'll be ready for that as well, assuming that it's safe and that people are vaccinated. So, there are a number of channels that we can pursue, but you should understand that our strategy is really to meet the clients where they want to be met. As an example in the down market, our clients rely on trusted advisors like accountants and brokers, we have very, very strong partner relationships with those channels, and that's how we drive results in that channel. So it really varies channel by channel, but you should understand that we are pursuing every channel, every avenue including upping our digital marketing investments to make sure that, we're getting our fair share of that without throwing money away. Samad Samana : Great. Thanks again for taking my questions. I really appreciate the thoughtful answers. Operator : Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Kartik Mehta : Good morning. Carlos, you talked about net gains. I'm wondering if that's related strictly to ADP having a better set of products, or is that related to the competition doing something else? And just my second question, you've talked a lot about the sales process. And I'm wondering, if you believe afterward, through this pandemic, get the vaccinations done, that fundamentally if the sales process will change, and that you'll use more digital versus face-to-face? Thank you. Carlos Rodriguez : I think, I'm in the same camp as I think many other CEOs of companies that - and again, there's very - there are not a lot of companies like ADP that operate all the way from the down market into the up market. So there has to be balance here in terms of it's not one clear cut answer. But I'm in the camp, for example, in the up market with some of my other competitors, and CEOs who believe that, there will be face-to-face meetings again, and particularly sales meetings. But I'm also in the camp of believing with lots of others that we shouldn't assume that things are going to go back exactly the way they were before. Whether it's with the way people are working, or the way people are selling, we're going to have to adapt to what inevitably is going to be some change. Having said that, I believe I saw a statistic the other day that said that, prior to the pandemic about 10% of the U.S. workforce was working from home. And it went up to 33% at the worst part of the pandemic, and then came back down to 25%. And I kind of monitor this through other sources that show that ticked up slightly again the number of people working from home as this virus continued to surge. But you would expect that 25% to probably go back to 15%, 20%, but not probably back to 10%. But remember that the other 70% never worked from home. And today 75% of the people are not working from home. But that doesn't mean that we haven't learned new techniques. So for example, an initial meeting or a follow-up meeting, or maybe even an implementation meeting with our client, I think we've all learned that. It's much more effective to do that for both parties virtually. But it's hard to believe that we're going to go back exactly to where we were before. It's also very hard to believe that we're going to stay exactly the way we are today. And again, I hate to give you wishy-washy answer because I think we're going to have let that play out. But we are like lot of other things, we're maintaining optionality and equipping our sales force to be prepared for either of those eventualities. And I think you had a first part of that question that\u2026 Kartik Mehta : Client growth, whether its product? Carlos Rodriguez : Oh client. On the client growth side, again we are - I think I mentioned in one of my script, that all of our strategic platforms, so if you think about RUN, Workforce Now, Globalview, I forgot the other ones I mentioned, but the platforms that we are that are strategic that we're investing in, not just the Next Gen ones are all growing, and they are growing very robustly, and I don't want to people understand that. And part of the challenge is that, we have a large company and we have other things that maybe aren't growing as fast, or we have a drag from a platform that we're trying to get off of. And we unlike from others try to report the fact as they are. But maybe take a little bit of liberty what others are doing, and giving a little bit more color about just the things that are going well. But if you did that, like we'd only focused on the growth of, for example Next Gen, it would be 800% growth, or if we focused the growth of Workforce Now, across the board, not just in the mid-market, because we also use Workforce Now in the up market, and we use Workforce Now in our PEO, you would see robust growth even in the middle of a pandemic on a Workforce Now. So, I think we're making progress but we're a large organization with large market share and included that exposes our flanks, and we have to be very good at making sure that we protect our flanks which I think we're doing a good job of, as evidenced by retention. But when you look at the go-forward and the growth of our strategic platforms, there is a lot of reasons for optimism that we will I think be able to compete effectively on a go-forward basis. So, I am not sure I can give you lot more detail of that, because this is more detail than we normally give, because we like to just be straight shooters and the growth is what it is, whether it's on client counts or a revenue. But if you want a little bit of additional color underneath the covers, the strategic platforms are doing very well against our competitors. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open. Mark Marcon : Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. So, questions basically about Next Gen payroll and Next Gen HCM. The first part is this, can you talk a little bit more, give us a little bit more color with regards to Next Gen Payroll just in terms of the number of clients that have been sold? What percentage of the existing Workforce Now base has been converted? And how you are thinking about that going through? And kind of what you're seeing in terms of the satisfaction, once you have that in place, you made some initial comments, that sounded really positive? And then the follow-up is this basically on Next Gen HCM, just in terms of what the outlook is there in terms of new sales and new bookings? Thanks you. Carlos Rodriguez : Sure. Thanks for the question. We thought it was optimistic before prepare yourself, because the story on Next Gen Payroll and HCM is quite positive for us in terms of the future. If you look at Next Gen Payroll, we have I think close to a couple hundred let's say over 200 live clients. So not just old but live clients. We have over 500 that are sold. I think we said in our comments that you may not have picked up on that, we think that it's possible even though this is not scientifically provable that up to 25% of the sales we had so far of Next Gen Payroll we would not obtain without Next Gen Payroll. So I think that bodes well for I think our competitiveness and our market share. And our clients were to have call it somewhere around a couple 1,000, I think for this fiscal year. So, it's positive momentum, again the caveat there is with Next Gen HCM we are generally going after very large clients, and in the case of Next Gen Payroll, it is really a platform that solves our kind of Next Gen Payroll needs across the board and we started and call it the core of our mid-market. So, call it between 50 and a 150 employees really has been our focus. But having said that, it's still pretty impressive and we're pretty happy and pretty positive. Satisfaction levels are very high. And I think we just got great the momentum and the sales force is obviously incredibly excited. Even though, remember, this is still a back-end engine right. So it's still Workforce Now and in the future, it will be lifting on that are using high as an engine. But it does provide some additional benefits to the client and a lot of sizzle as well, as we know that matters as well, given some of our competitors I think have used sizzle in their sales process. And so, we're able to use some sizzle now with Next Gen Payroll. So very excited about that rollout and about the progress there. Our Next Gen HCM, you heard about our rollout in Mexico, which is really Next Gen HCM with Pay. So we have call it, a handful of clients now in four countries that are actually running on Next Gen HCM with Pay. Again, it's very early like to talk about only a handful of clients isn't a lot, but what was most encouraging is that in a couple of those situations we were able to use what we're calling a federated development process, which is one of the intentions whether we invest into the platform which to be able to build rapidly. So, the Mexico client was onboarded in from super messaging  the building platform, getting the client and getting them onboarded in call it six to nine months. So very, very impressive for us to be able to do that. So, we're optimistic that this will continue to hopefully help us again competitively. And I think you also asked about how many clients we've migrated off of Workforce Now on to Pay, and remember that it's we're not migrating clients off of Workforce Now, we're just changing the underlying payroll engine that is still on the Workforce Now. And the outlook of that is I think not many, like this is mostly new logo sales in the case of Next Gen Payroll. Again, underneath Workforce Now. So, as we go to market, it's still Workforce Now with the Pay payroll engine beneath it. And again footnote, I think I said this last quarter, Workforce Now is a Next Gen platform. We don't talk about it that way, because we haven't been talking about it that way, but Workforce Now with Pay is a Next Gen platform. Mark Marcon : Got it. I appreciate it. Sounds very optimistic. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thank you. Hey, Kathleen, you talked about the digital transformation a couple times. We're in argue kind of in that process and I think the last number you'd referenced was about a $150 million benefit. Is that still the way to think about it in the 150 range? Or does that get accelerated based on some of the investments in your portfolio as a result of the Q2 outperformance? Kathleen Winters : Yes, Kevin thanks for that question. That 150 still follows, that was our estimated benefit for the year, the current fiscal year from digital and other transformation efforts. Where are we in that journey? I'd say we're in the early days, early I mean, as I mentioned these projects are not chats to implement projects. These are not basically four months projects that you rollout. These are how do we secure or build the right tools to take work out of the system. How do we - well, some of it can be little faster like continuing to build that chatbox functionality and how many inquires  and some of those to go faster. But some of them could be longer projects like, supporting our implementation teams with tools that we're building. So, my view is we're in the early innings here. We've had some good success thus far. We continue to stay very focused on building pipeline of projects. And if everything all part of the company that we expect and that we go to, to say, what are you doing to digitally transform what you do. How do you take work out of the system and its front office and its back office? So, we got a lot more work to do there, and I think that's a really good thing. Kevin McVeigh : And then just one quick follow-up, maybe  as it relates to that. How does that impact your addressable market, because I'd imagine it probably expands it in terms of average client size, things like that? Is there any way to frame what the transformation is going to mean, in terms of addressable market longer-term? Carlos Rodriguez : It's a good question and something that we think about a lot, right, as I think one of the things we want to try to get is we talked about share of wallet, new logos, but we can expand our addressable market that is very helpful. And it really varies business by business. But as an example, we are, I think, in the early stages, I would say, still not ready. I think I'm not supposed to say anything about it. But we think that in the down market, there is part of the addressable market that we could do better with if we had a more kind of end-to-end digital product, if you will, in terms of - so this would be a complement to RUN, that would compete in a segment of the market that we don't compete in today. Likewise, if we go all the way to the up market and international with the acquisition of Celergo was intended to kind of bolster, I think, a market that is growing and that I think is expanded by our acquisition of Celergo. And the Next Gen platforms, if you will, are for sure intended to expand the addressable market. So for example, the Next Gen payroll engine, again with Workforce Now would probably be have more appeal to an in-house user, even though people don't think there's a lot of those left, there are still people who use kind of in-house software if you will. And I think that this Next Gen payroll platform combined with Workforce Now provides more control, which is something that for the last 20 years, when we survey the market, if you will to assess what's addressable, there was always this kind of outsourcing versus in-house. And I think what's happened is that, cloud technology has blurred that line, but there's still a line there. And the ability to have the payroll platform perform some other things that people want from a control standpoint when they're in-house, I think expands that addressable market. And then lastly, in terms of Next Gen HCM, I mean, clearly, the big play there and the big investment was to expand the addressable market in the up market for us, both the larger and more complex clients, but the clients who also had HR needs that, we were not necessarily able to satisfy with some of our older platforms. So definitely, I think, a lot of opportunity and it's a key focus of our strategy in terms of how we develop our products, is to expand the addressable market. Kathleen Winters : Yes. Kevin, you can think about as our digital work, our digital transformation is meant to improve and accelerate on both top-line and from an efficiency productivity standpoint. From a top-line perspective, whether it's the addressable market and accessing that through Next Gen or other feature improvements that we're making, sales cycle time, shortening that cycle time to get something through the sales process. We're working on that in our PEO business, improving via digital work, improving service. So with improved service, therefore, improved NPS, therefore improved retention. So it's meant to target both acceleration from a top-line perspective and as we've talked about taking work out of the system and productivity. Kevin McVeigh : Thanks so much. Operator : We have time for one more question. And our last question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JP Morgan. Your line is open. Tien- Tsin Huang : Thanks so much. Good results and I appreciate the very clear guidance as well. Just a question and a follow-up or clarification. Just on the KPIs, Carlos, that you're most focused on the second half. Just hearing everything you talked about, positive revisions to retention, bookings. I'm curious, if there are any underappreciated KPIs at this point of the cycle that we should be tracking to gauge the sustainability of the improvement that you're talking about, as we get through the second half of the year? And just a clarification, I think you touched upon it in the last comment here. Just the 25% of sales of Next Gen payroll that would not have been attained without it. Is - are you - are those clients on a cloud platform that are looking for a cloud like the controls and whatnot that you're talking about that that was the condition for considering? I'm just trying to understand why they didn't consider it before it if that makes sense? Carlos Rodriguez : Yes, listen, I think unfortunately, I don't have that level of detail I'm afraid to say. We would probably maybe follow-up to give you a little more color that's why I tried to use the words not scientific. So our sales force - we are obviously very, very focused on the rollout of our Next Gen platforms. And so as we try to keep close communication and close tab with our sales force on how it's going, and they came to us and said, we think we got 25% more logos as a result of Next Gen Payroll than we would have gotten in the past. I'm guessing there are going to be a number of different reasons for that, including there maybe a little bit of a sizzle factor there, in terms of - because as you know, we run fully compliant payrolls. We help our clients with PPP loans. I mean we were able to do everything, like our existing platforms are the most robust, most comprehensive, most effective, I believe, of course, I'm biased in the industry. But there are incremental improvements, that give people whether it's the control aspect that I mentioned or the sizzle that help sales, and it's no different than you go buy a car and there is five different models of the same car. And people buy the five different cars but you have to have new cars every now and then, and I think it's every five years whatever that cycle is, and I think that's maybe some of what's happening here. But we'll try to get you a little bit of additional color if we can, but that was an intent to spark a kind of a new level of disclosure if you will about what percentage of our 25% came as a result of which feature. But we'll try to provide some color either in the interim, or certainly on the next call, when we're going to have many more clients on Next Gen Payroll, and we'll have a little bit more data for you. On the question you had about KPI's, I would say, you hit on all of them, like there's lot of important ones that you just touched on that we watch and that we share with you. The other ones that I think are important are ones around productivity both for sales, but also for our service and implementation associates. And in particular on sales, that's part of why we're talking about kind of the underlying trends improving, and us being so optimistic about the future is, there's no reason why our sales force can't get to the same productivity, they were pre-pandemic and then continue to increase that productivity as they had been doing for many, many years. And so that's one of those KPIs that we watch very carefully is what's happening to that sales force productivity number quarter-on-quarter, and what's it expected to do in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter, and luckily, it's on track and that's something that we watch very carefully. Likewise, the productivity per service rep and productivity of implementation, so as an example, how many new clients can an implementation rep on board, and these are all impacted by the digital transformation that Kathleen was talking about. Because our goal is to make it easier and better for our clients, and as a byproduct, hopefully reduce our operating expenses, not reduce our operating expenses, and then figure out what happens after that, because the most important driver of the long-term value here is client retention. And I can tell you that if we maintain these client retentions, you guys should go do the math on how much faster our revenue will grow on a normal steady state basis with the same bookings. It's pretty powerful. And obviously that's incremental revenue growth that doesn't have incremental sales expense or implementation expense. So the most important thing for us to do is to make good on our commitment to our clients. But having said that, those productivity metrics are important, too, in determining kind of our ability to drive margin into the future, because those are two big buckets of expense, our service and implementation costs. And again, that's another item where the KPI that would really be around not just NPFs and retention, but around productivity. And the good news there is that we've been showing really good productivity improvements, while we've also been driving very good retention, which speaks to the success of our digital transformation efforts. Tien- Tsin Huang : Very clear. Thanks so much. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I'm pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. End of Q&A: Carlos Rodriguez : Well, I think I mentioned already that it's hard to imagine where we were just a quarter ago, because I think on the same call a quarter ago, there was no vaccine, there was no stimulus approved and there was no new administration in Washington. We were still waiting for or looking forward to an election. So, besides all of the great things that our associates are doing in terms of execution, our sales force and all of our associates, in terms of helping our clients through this and helping each other, I just thank God for where we are today versus where we were last quarter, because we know now, I think we knew some of us knew that we would be okay eventually. But now, we know for sure that we're going to be okay in terms of our friends, our families, but also our economy and I think our companies and the things that we also value on the professional side. So, very excited about the prospects of getting through the next month or two, which I know we're going to be challenging for all of us, but also looking forward to much better times ahead to plenty of pent-up demand, to growth and productivity, to strong GDP and all the great things that are going to happen once we finally defeat the virus and move on. So I would just close by saying, thank you to the scientists, the pharmaceutical companies and everyone else who got us to where we are today and that continue to move us forward as a country and as a globe. And I appreciate you all joining the call and listening to us today. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the program, you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, my name is Crystal, and I'll be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Third Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks and will be a question-and-answer session.  Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Danyal Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Danyal Hussain : Thank you, Crystal. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining ADP's third quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call and webcast. Participating today are Carlos Rodriguez, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathleen Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call. During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these items along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release. Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. And with that let me turn it over to Carlos. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you, Danny. And thank you everyone for joining our call. This morning, we reported another strong set of quarterly results that were ahead of our expectations. With revenue growth of 1% and adjusted EBIT margin down 90 basis points, combining for a modest adjusted diluted EPS decline of 2%. This of course was the final quarter, before we begin to lap the impact of the pandemic, and I'm very proud of our organization's ability to have delivered positive revenue and earnings growth for the first nine months of the fiscal year despite unprecedented challenges in the economy and the labor markets. I'll start with a review of some of our key performance drivers and an update on the operating environment, we've been experiencing. This quarter, our Employer Services New Business Bookings reaccelerated and we delivered 7% growth, a strong result for the team. The improved year-over-year growth compared to the second quarter was driven by every business unit. Importantly, we ended the quarter on a particularly strong note with record March sales performance that was well above pre-pandemic fiscal 2019 levels, which we see as a positive signal for client engagement in the quarters ahead. The selling environment will likely continue to evolve, month-to-month, and with differences on a regional basis as COVID cases and the reopening trajectories stabilize. We are optimistic that with vaccine deployment progressing steadily, our clients are in the best position since the pandemic started to begin making buying decisions again. Kathleen Winters : Thank you, Carlos, and good morning everyone. Q3 represented another strong quarter for us with our performance on both revenues and margins driven by excellent execution across the organization. Our revenues grew 1% on both a reported and organic constant currency basis, which represented a slight acceleration versus Q2. We delivered this growth despite incremental drag from client funds interest versus Q2, as well as some incremental pressure related to our usual seasonal Q3 revenue drivers such as annual W-2 Form. I'll share more on these in a moment. As anticipated, we also experienced a margin decline as we continued to make additional growth in productivity investments and as we experienced a more significant client funds interest revenue decline compared to prior quarters, but the 90 basis points of margin decline was better than our expectations. Combining this revenue and margin performance, our adjusted EBIT was down 2% to $1.1 billion. Our adjusted effective tax rate increased slightly compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2020, as we had less contribution from excess tax benefit on stock comp, but our share count was lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases, and as a result, our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.89 was down a modest 2% versus last year. For our Employer Services segment, revenues declined 1% on a reported basis and 2% on an organic constant currency basis, demonstrating steady growth rates compared to last quarter, despite additional pressure from two sources as I just mentioned, both of which were fully anticipated. First, with greater pressure from client funds interest, our Q3 has a seasonally larger client funds balance than other quarters of the year and as a result, it skews more to cash and cash equivalent investments where interest rates have been pushed down to near zero. As a result, our client funds interest declined 32% versus last year with average yield down 70 basis points, more than offsetting our strong balance growth, which improved to 6%. Second with the headwind related to seasonal Q3 revenues like the annual Form W-2 which effectively makes our Q3 slightly more sensitive to pays per control and employment turnover trends and other quarters. Looking past these two headwinds, underlying ES performance showed sequential improvement driven in part by continued record level retention that was partially offset by slightly lower than expected pays per control. Employer Services Q3 margin was down 120 basis points compared to last year ahead of our expectations. We continue to invest in headcount to support our growing client base. We also started lapping lower incentive costs from last year and we experienced greater pressure from the lower client funds interest revenue compared to the first half of this year. But at the same time we kept our focus on prudent cost control and continue to execute on our transformation initiatives. Operator :  And we will take our first question from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Your line is open. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks so much for taking my question this morning. I wanted to ask about the increase in person engagement with the sales force, can you kind of contrast for us the productivity you're seeing from those in-person meetings relative to the remote meetings? Is that something that we should consider to be an incremental sort of driver of productivity maybe beyond what we were expecting, as we go forward? Carlos Rodriguez : Yes, I think that's right. I think you would look at it really as incremental, because if you recall, like our first quarter, we had pretty robust sales results really with almost 100% of our sales force working virtually at that at that point. So we expect that the increased activity, if you listen to the tone of our comments that it's really incremental and hopefully gets us quickly back to the same productivity levels we were pre-pandemic, which we were approaching in the third and fourth quarter here, and then hopefully beyond that, because obviously part of our model before was that we expected some incremental improvement in productivity each year, in addition to increases in headcount and when you have combine those factors in addition to kind of new products and other things, that's what kind of drove our new business bookings growth, the combination of increases in headcount, and increases in productivity. So you're right, that's the path is this will help us get quickly back to our previous productivity and hopefully allow us to get above that, which is I think, important for us in terms of our long-term growth expectations. Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. And I wonder if you could comment too, on the environment around potential tax reforms. As I recall when the corporate tax rates fell, that was translated into lower client interest balances for you or client funds balances for you. I know it's early days and everything needs to move through Congress, but can you comment on the degree to which some of these changes may or may not be factored in your budgeting process or what you're expecting here in terms of tax changes going forward in the impact on your business? Carlos Rodriguez : I think for corporate, I think, if you're referring to really was clearly on the team, we've -- there's a lot of discussion about a lot of different things, including an increase in the kind of tax rate for the higher income individuals. But right now from -- And there's obviously discussion about capital gains taxes as well. But right now the thing that is probably most prevalent in discussions is corporate income tax rate, and I'm trying to think through I don't believe that there has really any direct impact on our balances obviously have an impact on ADP corporate itself, but I don't think that you have. Danyal Hussain : Yes, you're definitely right about the individual tax brackets having an impact on our float balance. So, back when we had the previous corporate tax reform in the individual bracket changes, it was a headwind. I think about a percentage point or in that ballpark. So, in theory, what will drive the tailwind to our growth will depend on the actual change in rates here and what that means for overall individual income taxes. So it would be a contribution is not factored in to our outlook at this time, but obviously it's something we would benefit from. Ramsey El-Assal: Terrific, thanks for taking my questions this morning. Danyal Hussain : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Dolev from Mizuho. Your line is open. Dan Dolev : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I got -- just a quick housekeeping and then longer-term strategic question. You guiding I think to 4Q EPS slightly below the Street. Is there any margin pressure to call out in the fourth quarter? Carlos Rodriguez : Well, I think if you -- from our prepared comments, you'd probably see that the pressures are what I would call self-inflicted in the sense that we believe is an opportunity for us to make some investments that improve our long-term growth prospects, both for '22 and beyond. And I think Kathleen particularly mentioned the two or three things that we're investing. And so the answer is no, there's no kind of mysterious margin pressure. In other words, the business continues to move in the right trajectory like almost every metric we have has improved in fact I say every metric we have has improved sequentially, even the pays per control, even though it was modest, it's still rounded to 6% down. We know now after watching the data at the beginning of Q4 that that's heading in the right direction and we can all tell from what's happening with unemployment but that-- that's going to also continue to improve fairly quickly here. So when you really kind of add it all together, like we're in a very strong position have very strong momentum and people who have known us for a long time, know that when we experience that we try to reinvest some of that and I think that's exactly what you're seeing in the fourth quarter. So I would say that those are conscious decisions that we are making. Dan Dolev : Yes. Kathleen Winters : And that's exactly right. And I'll just add in, in addition to what I think is smartly doing those investments in the fourth quarter and accelerating some of that, we've also got some year-over-year comp things going on right? As you would expect with selling having been down Q4 last year versus Q4 this year, we'd see incremental year-over-year selling expense in Q4 as well. Dan Dolev : Got it. And just my follow up is, it was very impressed to see bookings kind of back to fiscal '19 levels. Really strong. Can you maybe talk a little bit about how Next-Gen Payroll engine is helping bookings? Carlos Rodriguez : It's a relatively modest contribution because despite our level of excitement about really all of our Next-Gen platforms and even Roll, which you could argue that that's a NextGen solution as well. Again it's just because of the size and scale of our company like right now from a dollar impact standpoint, it's really not, that's not what's moving the needle really across the board, really in every business unit in every channel and every category, our bookings have been improving again sequentially every quarter and they continue to do that this quarter. So we believe that medium to long term, that's the key to us, sustaining kind of our multi-decade growth rates is these Next-gen platforms, but I just continue to caution everyone to because we want to give you the updates and we want to continue to focus on next-gen and I like, I appreciate the question important to kind of separate what's driving the quarters and what's driving the next fiscal year versus what's driving the next three to five years. And I would say that Next-gen payroll is going to be increasingly important in the next year or two from a bookings standpoint and we'll start to probably make a difference and will then give you that color in terms of what difference its making, but we should be cautious about revenue impact, just because of the recurring revenue model just takes a while for that to get into the revenue growth numbers, but it was positive, but really not. Now, we're really moved the needle. Danyal Hussain : And I would just add that. We shared that we sold hundreds of clients on our Next-Gen Payroll engine with Workforce Now, just for context, that compares to typically few thousand clients that we sell in the mid-market. So it's still a piece of the overall puzzle. But as that scale to become the majority and then ultimately, all of our mid-market sales then you truly feel the incremental benefit. Dan Dolev : Got it. So... Carlos Rodriguez : That come is really the message there. Dan Dolev : Thank you. Great stuff. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Eugene Simuni from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Eugene Simuni : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So I wanted to ask about down market and great to see the introduction of Roll to target the micro customers. I was hoping you can speak a little bit more broadly about evolution of competitive landscape through the pandemic down market, how RUN has done and kind of coming out of the pandemic, what opportunities exist for ADP to continue gaining share in the segment as I believe it has done prior to the pandemic? Carlos Rodriguez : Well, I mean I think there is a number of moving parts. And I think it probably depends on people's current business model. So, as you know, our business model is really more about providing not just a software-based to support right support you call service, you can call it compliance, and I think what we saw this year with all of the activity that the government had around the various stimulus programs to help companies and individuals and so we're that created a lot of complexity for employers, it appears that we're entering into an environment where despite the pandemic hopefully fading, there will be increased levels of government activity around employment and incentives and that kind of that kind of thing. I think that's a good environment for ADP and for our down market business because most small businesses, don't have the time or the inclination to really focus on these things and to take care of these things. So it works for some clients and we believe that that's why we're rolling out Roll, no pun intended, but once you get to even a little bit slightly larger you do end up running into issues that you need help with and you need support and you need advice and much of that can be automated, but you still need it. So for example, a lot of our PPP support reports were automated. So it doesn't mean that somebody has to get on the phone and have a discussion about your PPP report, but you have to be focused on providing the support and the compliance in addition to just the software. So I think that helped us this year and again, so to answer your question, how do we believe we're set up competitively right now? I think we're set up excellently, competitively, because we now have very simple solutions for the micro-market where people want to self-buy, self-install, and don't have complexity and maybe don't have issues with taxes or compliance or don't want to ask questions, because it's not priced or built to ask questions. But we also have the ability to provide this assistance that is important for even small clients for sure it's important for mid-sized clients and for larger clients, but I think what really got highlighted this year is that small clients need a lot of help and need a lot of assistance and you can see it in our growth rates in our retention in our client satisfaction, like in all of our metrics in our small business division that we happen to be in the right place at the right time I think to be able to help our clients and then hopefully no benefit from the tailwind of the demand that that's going to create on a go-forward basis. So anyway long-winded way of saying, I think we're in a great position, because of our business model. Eugene Simuni : Got it. Excellent. And then a quick follow-up from me on the global business. So just thinking about what we're seeing now, I think is strong kind of bifurcation of the recoveries in the US and abroad. Strong expectations for US recovery in your business in Global, is it growing, is it going slower? And is the implication that global might be kind of headwind to growth over the next couple of quarters? Danyal Hussain : As usual for us, things are a little more when you peel the onion back, there is a little bit more complexity because you're just the image you have is correct, but it hasn't really, translated into the results, our results have actually been quite good internationally, both in terms of bookings as well as just the performance of the business overall in terms of revenue, pays per control et cetera. Some of that is that a large portion of our business is in Europe and there were a lot of government programs there as well to help companies and to prevent high levels of unemployment. And so for example, our pays per control metric never got to the negative levels that we saw in the US, in Europe, so that was a benefit. At the same time, our bookings have been quite strong and I have to admit that I've been looking for the explanation for that other than really good execution on the part of our sales force as they moved into a virtual environment because they had to sell virtually there as well. But I would say it's strong differentiation of our products. Again, the service aspect to our solutions, the ability to provide support and to provide compliance and help, all of those things probably helped our bookings performance internationally as well. So I would say that our global business actually is probably one of the bright spots. I would say despite what is obviously a very difficult environment, and we obviously feel for our businesses in not just Europe which now it happens to be improving again, particularly in the UK, but we're having challenges now in Toronto, we're having in Canada and in Brazil, we're having challenges. Obviously, as you know in India as well. But it's, it has not translated into negative results. So I think it's a testament to the resiliency and the strength of the business model. But I don't want to take anything away from the fact that it also obviously shows great execution by our international leaders as well. Eugene Simuni : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin from Cowen. Your line is open. Please check that, your line is not on mute. Bryan Bergin : Sorry about that. Question for you on ES versus PEO performance. It seems like pays per control appear to be a key difference, can you just dig in more on the at the mix aspects that seem to drive a pretty notable disparity of performance between those two. And should we expect that difference to persist in 4Q? Or do you expect more even performance? Danyal Hussain : I don't believe we've provided Lake that data, so I'm surprised you came to that conclusion but we maybe it's part of our tone. So there isn't a huge difference between ES pays per control performance and PEO, they both have been improving every quarter sequentially and the PEO doesn't include -- we generally stay away from very, very small clients. So we don't have a lot of clients that are one to two employees or five employees. The average size client in the PEO, I think is somewhere around 40, and so by definition, it tends to skew a little bit bigger than maybe our average client size for sure for small business, so actually, I'm looking at these figures last night. And it makes perfect sense kind of where we are, which is that the PEO is performing a little bit better in terms of absolute level of pays per control and have been improving sequentially just as ES has as well. So, and again I'm probably not allowed to say this, I'm going to get in trouble, but last night I got a note from the PEO that we experienced the first positive pays per control week. Now, the problem with pays per control is that it does vary based on payroll cycles. So if you have weekly payrolls or by-weekly payroll so you and I can't read anything into that. It's the first time we've had a positive pays per control in any week over the last 12 months. So that's a very positive sign. Bryan Bergin : Okay. And then just on margins, you should outperformance here in the quarter. But at the same time you've called out incremental headcount investments higher incentive comp, and I think elevated implementation costs, can you just talk about the drivers there and then how do we connect the elevated implementation cost with more efficient digital onboarding commentary? Danyal Hussain : Well, the efficient digital onboarding, I think, we were pretty clear with a FPS, we would love to, at some point in the future, extend that into the mid-market and maybe someday into the upmarket. But as you know, like you know better than us, because you've talked a lot of the competitors, there's not a lot of digital on-boarding going on for example of large complex ERP installations, not to pick on any competitors, but it's pretty. I know the images that the stuff, all kinds of its installed itself, but most of many of our competitors use third-parties. So there is still quite a lot of implementation activity and expense, whether it's done by the seller of the solutions or if it's done by a third-party. We haven't have a model where we do a lot of it ourselves. And so as bookings pick up and demand picks up, we need to add to our capacity for implementation in particular in the mid-market, the upmarket and also global, which as I mentioned has been strong. So it doesn't mean that we're not adding in the down market also. But in our small business segment as we alluded to, and as I think you pointed out, the digital on-boarding capabilities obviously reduce the need to grow headcount as much as we otherwise would have. But even in small business, we have a lot of growth in bookings and so it's a matter of the trade-off of how much can we on-board digitally versus how much we still need some help with, in terms of people being involved in. In terms of some of the other items that, we alluded to, I mean, some of this is just kind of natural to the business model, as we bring on more clients, we obviously expect productivity improvements every year, whether it's in sales or implementation or everywhere, but we are seeing a recovery of our business and very strong GDP forecast, and so, we're anticipating improved prospects for bookings and for revenue and for growth, and we need to make sure that we have the right staffing levels based on the productivity metrics that and the productivity goals that we have to be able to handle that business, so we can maintain our high clients of level -- high level of client satisfaction that we've, that we've experienced. And then we have some natural growth in expenses like I think Kathleen alluded to sales expense is clearly something that grows as you have sales success and as sales grow year-over-year. So I wouldn't, I wouldn't read too much into it rather than that, we made some conscious decisions to reinvest in some specific things in the fourth quarter to really position us well for 22 and beyond, but most of this is just kind of natural stuff where, again, as our revenue growth picks up over time, we still have a great incremental margin business where we would expect to have good operating leverage as we grow those revenues. Bryan Bergin : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon from Baird. Your line is open. Mark Marcon : Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Wondering if you can talk a little bit about the investments in Q4, just in terms of Next-gen, Wisely, marketing and advertising, just how much incremental spend will there be and are you seeing signs with regards to Wisely, that the interest is picking up and therefore, that's a great place to invest? Carlos Rodriguez : I don't feel like it's appropriate to give you, I think you asked for the numbers, I don't know that how -- I think you can probably do the math yourself, like in terms of, when you look at the trajectory that we're on, you could probably back in into some rough this is not in the hundreds of millions of dollars again. But again I respect the short-term orientation that we have here in that you guys are trying to. But I would not read as much as you may be reading into these fourth quarter investors, as we've done this in all the way back to my, Gary taught me everything I know and you Gary, I think as well Mark. And we are a long-term oriented company. And we -- when we see opportunities to improve and to invest in things that are either going to drive our bookings or drive our client satisfaction or drive our efficiency, that's what we are going to do it. We've been doing that all along. So this is, it's not like we hadn't invested, we've been telling you that we've been investing for the last three quarters. And that was a conscious decision, we took a little bit of a bidding for that at the beginning of the year. Fortunately, we had positive surprises on the revenue side and on pays per control and other things, but we committed that we were going to invest through the downturn and that's what we've -- that's what we've done. And now, we feel like there are few things that we can do that I would call -- I don't want to call them housekeeping items -- But they're not -- These are not in the hundreds of millions of dollars, but they put some pressure on our fourth quarter margin. And we knew that it would create some questions even though, it really has nothing to do with 22 or kind of our future expectations of either revenue growth or operating leverage, but I guess I understand the question, but I don't think that maybe Danyal can give you a little bit more color, but I am not sure we giving you an exact number is probably the right approach. Kathleen Winters : I mean you could -- Yes, I mean -- Sorry, Danyal, I would just I think about it as kind of these are tweaks to the amounts we're spending in Q4 versus kind of wholesale changes to the program here. So it's somewhat modest and what Carlos said it's not in the hundreds the millions of dollars here. Mark Marcon : I appreciate it. Danyal Hussain :  your wisely question, Mark. The one thing we did see was stimulus drove some uptick in the card spent per card. Other than that, during the pandemic, there hasn't been any real notable changes in the Wisely growth trends. So really it's the per card economics that have seen a slight to tick up recently. Carlos Rodriguez : Yes. And I think it's something that we've been excited about. But again, it was hard to get excited about, there was a lot of natural tailwind because people wanted more digitally oriented payment methods in the last three quarters, but from a focus standpoint like for the first couple of quarters of the year, we were focused on a lot of things, and this may not have made it all the way to the top of the list, but it was on a top of the list kind of pre-pandemic, if you recall, and so I think, I would see this is more of a re-emergence of some of the themes and some of the things that we had been talking about that excite us because I think the opportunity is a big ones, I'm glad that the team brought this forward in terms of as an investment opportunity because we were excited about it, call it 12 to 18 months ago, we should just as excited about it today. But admittedly, it wasn't our number one focus, and in the middle of the pandemic, if you will, at the beginning of the pandemic. Kathleen Winters : Yes. And then just one last comment is we always look very hard at the timing and amount that we spend on marketing and advertising but with economic activity continuing to have momentum and pick up and client engagement picking up, we felt this was the right time to increase that a little bit as well. Mark Marcon : I really appreciate that color. And it is completely consistent with the long-term track record. Going back to Art. Even before, Gary, can you talk a little bit about this Danyal or can you just remind us what the sensitivity on the pays per control to revenue is? Danyal Hussain : It's 25 basis points of revenue impact for every 1 percentage point change in pays per control. Mark Marcon : I appreciate that. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Kevin McVeigh : Great, thanks. Hey, Carlos, I think you alluded to kind of a record high on account none of us have sense about. Can you give us a sense of where that splits across enterprise mid-down market and how that sits relative to historical trends in the business? Carlos Rodriguez : Yes, I can give you some -- I'll give you some color. We don't -- I don't think that's something that we've disclosed in terms of the actual breakdown by business, but I can give you a general ideas. So we had that 6% growth, the 900,000, and we had call it growth of somewhere around that for RUN, our WSN growth was around that as well. And global view was around that as well. So from a client -- pure client growth standpoint if you look at our strategic platforms, they kind of grew in the kind of that neighborhood from a client growth standpoint, which we see as really great news given the very difficult environment that we're in. Obviously, when you look at the mathematically, the overall growth rate and the overall number It's driven in large part by our small business division, because that's where we have the bulk of the absolute number of clients. But I wanted to give you a little bit of color around, if you look at WF, if you look at Workforce Now, across our multiple channels, just remember we start Workforce Now, just in the -- not just in the mid-market but we saw it in the upmarket, and we saw it in the PEO. The PEO platform as well, we also have that platform in Canada. And so that gives you some sense of Canada how well that platform is growing, which is really satisfying to us. So hopefully that helps a little bit. Kevin McVeigh : Now, that's helpful. And then just on the retention, real quick, I think you took it up from the 125 basis points, up from 100 basis points. Can you just refine that a little bit, is that kind of the Q4 run rate or is that the full year number of this at being fourth quarter is even higher than that? Or is that infinite? The EPM number, and then just any thoughts you could just may be frame on a little bit more . Carlos Rodriguez : You've stumped us. Danyal Hussain : I think, we said in the opening remarks that it's on the Q3 performance being stronger than expected. Carlos Rodriguez : Yes, I think it's generally it's been consistent like it's really frankly remarkable, which is why we keep emphasizing some caution because we hope there is no plan, we're not going to give it back and we're not hoping for give back. But in this business like people who've been following us for a long time, like when we have a 10 basis points to 20 basis point move in retention. It's a big deal. So to have this kind of retention on top of the retention that we had last year is pretty remarkable. And so we're pretty excited about it and I think the key for us is trying to determine like when I look at the retention figures, there is a lot of improvement in what's called the controllable losses. So the ones that are related to kind of service issues and so forth. So we're excited that we might be able to hold on to some of this gain, but at the same time, we're realistic enough to acknowledge that some of the stuff that was related to pan out of business and government stimulus there might be a little bit of give back there, but it's been pretty consistent like every -- It seems like every quarter, the improvement has been in that same neighborhood year-over-year, hence why we kind of tweak the full year because we're probably going to end up in the range that we gave you, which is a little higher than we had before, but it wasn't, we were trying to like send any kind of message about the fourth quarter in particular. Kevin McVeigh : Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Tien- Tsin Huang : Hey, thanks so much. I think a lot of good questions already. Just thinking about the retention feels like it's industry wide to some degree. So just trying to better understand your new sales, the reacceleration is it driven more from upselling, and in new business formation, and any surprises in the net switching over the balance of trade from a head-to-head standpoint? Carlos Rodriguez : I don't have a lot to report on. We obviously watch all that stuff where you referring to the balance of trade. And as you said, it's hard for me to tell about retention in terms of the rest of the industry you guys would be the experts on that because my casual review of some 10-Ks makes it kind of hard to compare like some people would say retention of their annual recurring revenue cloud revenues, which is not the same as the retention for their company. So it's kind of hard for me to say, I mean, some of it I would say it's probably more variable than you think, based on what I'm seeing in terms of variability of growth rates, because it's clearly been a huge part of our ability to outperform. I mean this is a pretty remarkable revenue performance given what we've been through. And given the pays per control headcount and by the way, what we brought up yet, but we have a huge headwind on client funds interest, which is going to abate here in the fourth quarter and is going to abate next year as well. There may still be a little bit of headwind, but this was really the worst quarter that we had, and these nine months were bad and was $130 million drag just from client funds interest. So when you put everything into the pot, without really good strong retention, it's hard to outperform the way we have and we've done some work on the relative performances of us versus some of our competitors and we feel pretty good about that and about our -- to the potential for retention to be one of the needle movers there, making some other factors that I'm not, we're not, we haven't thought about, but no, I don't think there's anything else really big out there like we've done a little bit better against some of our -- the usual competitors that you know about, in terms of balance of trade but there's others that are still challenging for us. And so, net-net we're pretty comfortable with where we are and determined to continue to drive our growth. I think all of us are probably benefiting from overall economic growth. And the fact that it seems like maybe there are some either in-house or regional providers that are because you can see our, we're growing our units. In Workforce Now, and in RUN. And so, we're -- it seems like we're all have some ability to grow in this environment, which is I guess good for everyone. Tien- Tsin Huang : Yeah, I'm glad you said all that, we shouldn't take it for granted. Just quickly on client satisfaction, notably higher would you attribute it Carlos more to the -- of course support efforts you guys have invested in, but the Next-gen platforms and some of the digital initiatives or are you also seeing just clients maybe building it more better goodwill with ADP spending more time with them during these tough times during the pandemic, just trying to understand, because it seems like it could be -- if it carries over we could see some compounding in the retention? Carlos Rodriguez : Yes, I think it's a great question. And I -- we obviously we're trying to figure that out because it's very important to the long-term value creation of the company. And it's all the things you mentioned are you obviously know the business well enough that you hit on all the question is how much is each of those rates, like the last one that you mentioned about the goodwill, there is no question that of being there like there were two or three months where people could not talk to anyone other than us about what to do. Right? What to do about the PPP loans that the government was offering around tax credits, because if you buy software from someone, you can't call to ask them those questions, I just want to remind everyone, right, you can call them that we're about the software and you can send in a ticket to get your software issue resolved, but you can't call to ask about tax deferrals or tax credits or PPP reports or any of that kind of stuff. So we clearly built a lot of goodwill. But on the other hand business is business. And goodwill, it doesn't last forever, so we're not, planning a living off of that for the next five or 10 years. So that brings me back to kind of the basics of client satisfaction, which is we have to be there for our clients when they need us not just during the pandemic, but at all times. So I would say that the second major factor besides the goodwill that I mentioned and some of the digital initiatives to like making easier for our clients and improve our user experience is that we did not panic at the onset of the pandemic. And if you recall, we took some lumps for that because we really maintained our investments both not just in R&D, we maintained our investments in headcount and an implementation. That doesn't mean that we didn't have some drift down as a result of some turnover, which we did and our head count did decline because we had a temporarily a drop in volume, if you will, but that was really, really important right, to be able to kind of get through this period and be able to deliver on our commitments to our, clients and back to the comments I made about productivity before, that's one of those things that we watch very carefully because we want to improve productivity but we weren't -- we can't be naive and think that if our obviously if our headcount was 10% lower, we have higher net income, the problem is, what would your client satisfaction be and your retention. And so that's the magic right of being able to figure out what's that right balance and you have tools to figure that out, you have monitoring systems right to understand what the client satisfaction levels are in relation to how quickly you're getting back to people to resolve their problems for example and how well trained your people are. So there's a number of different factors that we look at, but the key is to be committed to delivering high levels of client service, which we are and I think we just proved it. If we can do it during the pandemic, we can do it anytime. Tien- Tsin Huang : Yes. Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Your line is open. Jason Kupferberg : Good morning, guys. Thanks. I just wanted to start with the bookings question just to make sure you've got the expectations right here, just trying to do the math on the Q4 implied guide. I think it would be about 90% growth. So I wanted to see if that's accurate, obviously you've got the super easy comp there and maybe as part of that can you just talk about some of the activity you've seen through the first month of the quarter. I mean I assume you've got pretty high visibility here, just given that you raised the low end of the full-year guidance range for the bookings? Danyal Hussain : Hey, Jason. It's Danyal. You don't have the weightings by quarter. But what's implied for the fourth quarter is over a 100% bookings growth. And for example, we're tracking right in line with expectations. Carlos Rodriguez : Yes, I would say that you should not read anything into that other than what we said, which is, we're still really positive. We believe we're going to continue to get sequential productivity improvements, but the percentage growth rate is really related to the base effects, really when you get down to whether it's 110 or . Not that, I know, you know, it's not that for. I think you're trying to get a number you using the percentage we get to the number. But, yes, yes, you should probably -- if I were you, I would look at maybe call it the second quarter or maybe 2019 fourth quarter or something has got to be something else that would give you something good as a proxy, right? Where we don't expect to be back at 100% productivity levels in the fourth quarter, but we should be getting close to like where we were in 2019, and there may be other small moving parts there from 2019. So I don't want to go out on a limb and say that's the right analog but anyway, I think that's hopefully helpful. Jason Kupferberg : Yes. So it is -- your comp certainly would matter more. I just wanted to make sure people kind have the right numbers in their models for the quarter. And then just a quick follow-up on the pays per control, I think you mentioned it was a little worse than you anticipated in Q3 and you tempered your Q4 expectations a little bit. I'm just curious, which part of the portfolio is driving that? It just things maybe a little incongruous with the US employment data that we're seeing at a high level, which obviously has continued to outperform expectations? Carlos Rodriguez : Yes, it's a 100% timing related because we can see in the data, we have other datasets like to show us, like for example, job postings and background checks, screenings and so forth. And so, you shouldn't read anything into it and we did not temper our fourth quarter at all, and in fact we kind of try to clarify that we kept the full year, the same despite the third quarter being a little bit softer in part because we think we're on the same positive trajectory that I think that we thought we were on. So we're seeing the same thing you're seeing in terms of employment and unemployment, and we would fully expect these pays per control numbers to improve rapidly here. And remember that we're talking today about numbers that were through the end of the third -- Sorry through the end of March and those numbers are for three months. Correct? So if you look at the third month in March is different than it was for January. And January, February, I know it's hard to remember to think back that far and how bad things were, that was a completely different picture and the picture we had in early April and maybe in the last, very last week of March. So I wouldn't, I wouldn't read anything into it other than timing. Kathleen Winters : Yes. And you know just to clarity -- I were just to clarify, was just a slight tweak to the Q4 number and holding the full year at down 3% to 4%. So it's really kind of very minor tweaks. Jason Kupferberg : Okay, perfect. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Pete Christiansen from Citi. Your line is open. Pete Christiansen : Good morning, thanks for the question, Carlos. I think the high customer sat scores, the goodwill truly a testament to ADP's capabilities and certainly the service -- the service business model. But I guess clients' needs certainly change and we've been hearing from some of our other companies that talent acquisition has been I guess even more challenging than in the past and I recall at the last Analyst Day that ADP had really been making a lot of strides in improving its recruiting management tools so on and so forth. How would you, think that you, stack up competitively in that area, particularly in recruiting management tools and do you think that could be in another vehicle or vessel to maintain the high retention levels that you're currently experiencing? Carlos Rodriguez : Absolutely. I think that you're right, I mean, some of this obviously is cyclical, right in the sense that 12 to 18 months ago people were looking for other tools, other than client acquisition tools. So you have to be careful about not kind of shifting with the necessarily to be consistently able to help people throughout the whole lifecycle of HCM and right now that happens to be an important one. And so I would say that there's two things, one is we build our own tools, as you said around recruitment management and we also have an RPO business, and we have other tools to help with the talent acquisition process. We also partner and we have some really strong partnerships. I'm not sure -- if I mentioned the names of the companies are not but the names that you hear a lot of kind of advertising about, we have a very strong integration and partnerships with some of those companies to really make it easy, in particular in small business, but also even in the mid-market for people to use those tools to really help with the recruiting needs that they that they have, but we feel we've been making, we have made significant investments in our recruitment management platform and our talent acquisition platforms, nothing to do with the pandemic, so that you could call it for tools, that we had done that before the pandemic, and we would expect that those would be contributors to our overall value proposition into our revenue -- Sorry, into our bookings growth because those are generally tools that create incrementality around your bookings number. In other words, what you can charge clients is typically there is a core set of solutions and then recruitment management, things like time and attendance will workforce management, those tend to be more incremental around the basic package, if you will, of HCM. So we're positive, we're bullish on it and I think we're very, just as a reminder, our app marketplace is creates a very easy and seamless way for people to use different solutions in HCM and this would be a category that we would have a lot of partners in that market app -- in that app marketplace that allow you to get all the other benefits, you mentioned about ADP's business model and still be able to fulfill your talent acquisition needs, if you don't believe that ADP has what you need, which we believe you do, but if you don't, you can always get it through one of our partners. Pete Christiansen : That's helpful. And apologies if this was addressed earlier, but given the change in the yield curve, has there been any thoughts on potentially extending duration of the portfolio or any other investment selection choices as you head into '22? Carlos Rodriguez : Probably not worth mentioning. The -- as you know in the yield curve, like right now kind of 5 and 7-year is a little bit better than two and three just because of the way the Fed is managing the curve, if you will. So I think there are always, I'll call them tactical opportunities. But no, I mean I think our duration has been in the same range since I've been CEO, and I would anticipate that not changing and we're not changing laddering strategy and we're not changing our client funds interest strategies. The good news is that it appears the worst is behind us in terms of drag from client funds interest which was painful. I think we had a $50 million drag just this quarter. So, again, not to beat a dead horse, but it just shows the strength of the business that we didn't mention that to you. And if we kind of overcame that drag $130 million for the year. So we're looking forward to better times ahead, and I did see an interesting chart. Again, I probably shouldn't say this, but we had $16 billion in balances in 2008 and we had $635 million in client funds interest. I'm sorry, $685 million not $635 million, in client funds interest. So just shows to you the magnitude, I mean, you all know what's happened to interest rates, but that was 2008, that wasn't like in a different century or in a different country like that was here, and so today, our balances are call it the mid $20 billion number for the year and that's the expectation, so I think you could probably do the math yourself in terms of, if we do believe that there's going to be some inflation here and if you look at the inflation breakevens and you look at some other things that are going on, We're looking forward to better times ahead for client funds interest. Pete Christiansen : And the adjusted EBITDA margin was 19% back then. You're already above that, that's great, thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. And we have time for one more question that comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeff Silber : My questions have already been asked. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes our question and answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for any closing remarks. Carlos Rodriguez : So as you can tell from our comments, we continue to, I think, have the same level of optimism, as we had last quarter and we're really, really thankful for the performance of our sales organization and also our frontline associates in terms of what they've been able to do for our clients and at the risk of ending on a negative note though, all of this positive, and all of this positivity and enthusiasm, we don't want to overlook the fact that we still have some challenges and some people still have some challenges in other parts of the world. This is a US headquartered company with over 80% of our revenues in the US. So that's probably why you're hearing all of this optimism, but we're not only in the US, we have associates in India, in Brazil, in Canada, and in Europe. And the situation is not the same there. Even though the businesses are performing well, we just as back in the spring of last year, it was enormous suffering and challenges here in the US among our associates, the same thing is happening for some of our associates in some other parts of the world, in particular in India. And we are not going to forget them, we're doing everything we can to help them. We appreciate what the US government is doing along with the Indian government and local governments to help as well. And we look forward to have helping them kind of get through the same difficult situation that we managed to get through and they too will have their vaccination rates pickup in all of those parts of the world and they too will emerge from the pandemic. But it's clear that it's going to take a little bit longer and we should all remember to be there to help them and support them in any way we can, and I think people will do exactly that. But, having said that, we are --close to seeing the situation in the rearview mirror here and we're really anxious to see our growth rates, we accelerate to kind of where we were pre-pandemic here at some point in the future and getting back to the business and to helping our clients with their challenges and helping our associates build careers and helping all of you and our other shareholders and stakeholders get a fair, a fair return for their investment. So again, as always, we appreciate your interest in ADP and we appreciate you tuning in and we will be back in a quarter with our outlook for fiscal year '22. Thank you! Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. Ay name is Sarah, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP\u2019s Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Danyal Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Danyal Hussain : Thank you, Sarah. And welcome everyone to ADP\u2019s fourth quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. Participating today are Carlos Rodriguez, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathleen Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the fourth quarter and full year. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today\u2019s call. During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these items along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release. Today\u2019s call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. I\u2019d also like to share that we intend to host our Investor Day on November 15th. At this time, we\u2019re planning to keep it virtual for most of our attendees. But given positive reopening trends, we do have capacity here in our Roseland, New Jersey headquarters to host our sell side analysts live and we look forward to seeing our analyst community in person soon. With that, let me turn it over to Carlos. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you, Danny, and thank you everyone for joining our call. We reported very strong fourth quarter results, including 11% revenue growth and 5% adjusted diluted EPS growth, capping a year end which revenue and margin outperformed our expectations in every quarter. For the full year, we delivered 3% revenue growth, the high end of our guidance range, and I\u2019m happy to say, we reached $15 billion in revenue, a big milestone for the company. As we\u2019ve discussed all year, we took a consistent approach to investing this year, while also prudently managing expenses. As a result, our adjusted EBIT margin was down only slightly and we were able to deliver 2% adjusted diluted EPS growth for the year, ahead of our guidance and well ahead of our expectations at the start of the year. I\u2019ll first cover some highlights from the quarter. Our new business bookings results were very strong and our momentum in the market continues to build. Compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter, we grew our Employer Services New Business Bookings by 174%, which was slightly ahead of our expectations. And for the full year, we delivered 23% growth in ES bookings, towards the higher end of our guidance. We are very pleased with this outcome from our sales team, which booked $1.5 billion in new business in a year with a high degree of economic uncertainty. Kathleen Winters : Thank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter represented a strong close to the year, with 11% revenue growth on a reported basis and 9% growth on an organic constant currency basis, solidly ahead of our expectations. Our adjusted EBIT margin was down 120 basis points better than expected. And as a reminder, we did have some compare -- comparison pressure versus last year\u2019s lower selling and incentive compensation expenses that drove the comparative decline. Our 5% adjusted diluted EPS growth was strong, and in addition to the revenue and margin performance benefited from share repurchases. For our Employer Services segment, revenues increased 10% on a reported basis and 8% on an organic constant currency basis, as we lapped last year\u2019s pandemic affected Q4. We continued to see contributions from excellent retention, strong new business booking and growth in pays per control offset by lower client funds interest. ES margin was down 90 basis points due primarily to higher selling and incentive compensation expenses versus the prior year. Our PEO also had another very strong quarter. Average worksite employees increased to 616,000, up 12% on a year-over-year basis on both continued retention outperformance and contribution from solid employment growth. Our PEO revenue grew 12%, an impressive performance as we once again benefited from higher payroll for WSE, as well as stronger workers comp and SUI revenue for WSE compared to the prior year, partially offset by lower growth and zero margin pass-throughs. PEO margin was up 340 basis points in the quarter, due to an elevated worker\u2019s compensation reserve true-up last year. We were very pleased with our strong finish to the year. For fiscal 2021, a year heavily impacted by a pandemic, we drove strong bookings growth, solid 3% revenue growth, delivered positive EPS growth and continue to invest for sustainable growth and digital transformation. Operator : Thank you.  We will take our first question on the line of Eugene Simuni with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open. Eugene Simuni : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe to start with a little bit of a high level macro question, so Katelyn, you just highlighted that there is significant amount of secular growth that\u2019s coming out in HR services industry from the pandemic? Can you speak a little bit more about where you guys are seeing the indications that the secular growth is actually helping, financial performance of ADP and how much of that is incorporated in your fiscal year 2022 guidance and where can we see that effect in the numbers? Carlos Rodriguez : I think there are probably a couple of highlights. I think, Kathleen, probably has a couple of other, she would -- she can mention. But, like, I think, we mentioned in our prepared remarks, what we\u2019re seeing around Workforce Management in terms of time tracking and scheduling and so forth. We also mentioned some of the products we\u2019ve developed for Return to Workplace. So there are a number of things that are probably related to what\u2019s likely to be a more hybrid work environment for white collar employees at least on a go-forward basis, which probably requires people to think about their investments in HCM in terms of what they can do to maximize, the recruiting and the retention and the engagement of that hybrid workforce. So I think that is one. The other one is, there\u2019s always been a secular uptrend in terms of regulatory related and this is on a global basis, demand for HCM products. In other words, the more complexity there is around being an employer, the greater the demand for the wide array of services that we provide. That secular trend has probably gotten a bit of a boost based on in the U.S. the change in administrations, right, which we\u2019ve had that secular growth for seven years that ADP has existed. But there are times where it\u2019s stronger in terms of a tailwind and sometimes where it\u2019s weaker. And I would say that we\u2019re heading into strong secular tailwind here, as a result of some of the increased attention on regulatory actions. And you probably all saw, I think, it was yesterday, the day before, that the President signed number of executive orders, most of which are aimed at employer employee related relationships that increase the amount of tracking and reporting and compliance necessary on the part of employer. So those are a couple that I would mention. I think our retention rate also shows in -- an indirect way secular demand improving right in the sense that people have kind of rethought dropping or switching from their HCM vendors. But that one is a little difficult to be 100% sure about, because we do expect some normalization in that retention rate. Kathleen Winters : Yeah. I think that really covers a lot of that. I mean to kind of summarize and categorize what Carlos said, when you think about the complexity, number one, of being employer, the ongoing and pretty significant changes that we see from a regulatory standpoint. So complexity, regulatory change, the dynamic environment as the way people work and employer relationship -- employer employee relationship changes, it\u2019s a very dynamic environment. All of that is, you can just see in, the bookings number that we have. Our bookings, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get into the discussion on this, but the growth is pretty broad base. I mean, certainly, we saw some channels stronger than others, but it\u2019s pretty broad base. And I think that\u2019s because of all of this dynamic change and complexity that we see, and in particular, our comprehensive solutions that our outsourcing solutions have seen quite significant growth. So we\u2019re really encouraged about the macro trends that we see in the space. Carlos Rodriguez : And again, I think that, it\u2019s all -- I\u2019ve always never known what is defined the secular versus not secular. But the huge demand now for talent, what\u2019s happening in the labor markets. Obviously, that\u2019s a huge tailwind for all of us in the HCM space in terms of recruiting tools and engagement tools to try to hold on to people. But that could also be something that wanes in six months. That\u2019s -- that one\u2019s a little harder to tell. But generally speaking the war for talent has always been also a secular tailwind to our industry as well. Eugene Simuni : Got it. Got it. Thank you. Great. And then for a follow up related and talking about the bookings growth and looking at your guidance for 10% to 16% growth next year. Can just quickly speak to kind of two or three key swing factors that you see that will define whether we\u2019re going to end up on the lower end or higher end of that range, as we kind of turn the corner on the recovery and go through the spirit? Carlos Rodriguez : Sure. So the -- actually I can probably give you a three that would probably account for kind of the way we think about this. So number one, obviously, is what we just talked about is the secular and cyclical tailwinds or headwinds. So if the economy continues with the momentum it\u2019s got, we\u2019re feeling pretty good. Obviously, if we end up having more challenges, because of the pandemic or otherwise, but right now the amount of -- even the existing government stimulus, even if there\u2019s no additional stimulus is pretty strong and also the pent-up demand and all these -- the reopening. That feels like a very good backdrop for us from a bookings growth standpoint. And then, as long as we have that background or that backdrop that\u2019s positive, it really comes down to really two things is sales force productivity at the Sales Quota Carrier level time, number of Sales Quota Carriers and I hate to be so simplistic, but at our size, because we have new products and we\u2019re rolling out, you heard how excited we are about all the new things that we\u2019re putting out there. But we sell a lot of business every year. So for a smaller company, when they end up having like a new product launch that can cause all kinds of growths, and by the way, likewise, if you don\u2019t have any new products. But for us, what I would consider to be a steady-eddy. So we really grow through methodically improving and adding new products, making talking acquisitions, et cetera, a lot of us. But the key formula for us is we cannot hit our sales plan unless we have the headcount and we are continually improving our sales force productivity and that\u2019s exactly what our plan is. And we have some good news over the last four quarters where our sales force productivity at the Average Quota Carrier level steadily improved throughout the year to reach 90% for the full year. But we exited the fourth quarter in kind of the mid-90%s, if you will, in comparison to pre-pandemic levels. So it feels like we\u2019re getting back to the quote-unquote trend from an average sales productivity standpoint and if we can get back to that trend, and we deliver on our hill -- on our headcount additions, we should be able to hit our new business bookings number. Eugene Simuni : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of Pete Christiansen with Citi. Your line is now open. Pete Christiansen : Good morning. Thanks for the question. Carlos, you talked about a lot of new logo wins this year, which is pretty impressive. But I was curious to hear how you think about how this may have changed your or ADP\u2019s cross-sell, upsell opportunity set? I\u2019d imagine the runway there is expanded quite a bit, and perhaps, how you are thinking about strategy, that land and expand strategy to really take advantage of this opportunity? Thank you. Carlos Rodriguez : Yeah. So one of the -- in case somebody asked that we, one of the questions we sometimes get is and it\u2019s related to what you\u2019re asking is the mix of how much is new logo sales versus how much is add-on sales. And it\u2019s really been very steady over many years. It was only during the ACA period where we had a little bit of a tilt more towards incremental add-on sales. But it\u2019s -- for a long time been around 50-50 and it\u2019s still kind of in that neighborhood. So that I think bodes well because the more clients we add, the more opportunities we have pursue that land and expand, I think, approach that you just described. So I would say that, we\u2019re bullish on the opportunity to continue to go back to the new logos that we sold, which in many cases, we sell with multiple modules, but there\u2019s always additional room for new products as well to go back to that existing client base. So I think that underlying logo growth, I think, is another kind of supportive factor, if you will, for a new business bookings, because we do get about 50% of our bookings from our existing client base. Pete Christiansen : That\u2019s helpful. And as a follow up, I was just hoping if you could juxtapose the GlobalView business versus the rest of ES. I know, they haven\u2019t been totally in sync during this recovery. What are you seeing there of late trend wise? And as you look towards the outlook, is that part of the business considered or laggard behind the remainder of the ES or is there some variability there that investors should be aware of? Thank you. Carlos Rodriguez : It\u2019s actually a little bit of the opposite. Maybe we may have confused some people, I think, in prior calls. But I think, GlobalView is probably, could be at the top of our list in terms of performance this year, like, large multinational companies have been, I think, looking for ways. I think this pandemic rate -- raise probably some issues and concerns around control. I think for the HR leaders that probably raised some issues around engagement and making sure that you\u2019re connected to your global workforce and that you had global reporting, et cetera. So there\u2019s a lot of factors that probably went into what was incredibly strong demand and very positive sales growth. So I would say that, again, we don\u2019t disclose individual product lines, but I would say, the GlobalView sales were one of the stronger line items, I think, for us. And I\u2019ll add that to your question about differences between the businesses. I think all of our businesses really performed well. It\u2019s kind of hard, it really come down to trying to point out which ones were spectacular versus just good. And I would say that GlobalView and even our International business really were standouts and I -- really it\u2019s very impressive, because some of the situations in Europe, for example, were very challenging in terms of dealing with the pandemic, but I didn\u2019t really stop people from looking for solutions and it didn\u2019t stop our sales force from finding them, even though they had to do that from obviously from a remote workplace. So, I guess, summary is, GlobalView is a shining star for us. Kathleen Winters : Yeah. They saw good momentum as we closed out the year. In fact, it was a particularly strong closed with a good number of multinational deals on GlobalView coming through at the end of the year and we\u2019re looking at fiscal 2022 for them to be a big contributor again. Carlos Rodriguez : And again just -- the only -- again, it doesn\u2019t make a huge difference in the overall ADP revenue numbers. But these strong bookings remember will really translate into revenue and cause six months to 18 months, because these are large, typically large multinationals that take some time to implement. But that should be a positive thing for us kind of looking forward, if you will, in that six-month to 18-month horizon. Pete Christiansen : Thank you. Great color and really nice execution. Good job. Thank you. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. James Faucette : Great. Thank you very much and good morning. I wanted to ask quickly and I think it\u2019s tied into some of the comments you\u2019ve made around your guidance. But specifically, how are you thinking about like the well-publicized difficulties employers are having attracting employees and that kind of thing? How is that factoring into your guidance and your formulation and are expecting resolution of that as we go through the fiscal year. Just trying to get a little bit of color how you\u2019re putting the macro environment into forecasts? Carlos Rodriguez : Well, I mean, I would probably put that in the bucket of secular tailwinds or cyclical tailwinds, depending on your view of whether it\u2019s short-term or long-term. But it does seem like if this kind of resolves itself, let\u2019s -- there\u2019s a couple scenarios, but if it\u2019s transitory in terms of the friction of getting people into the right job and then six months from now some of this has passed, by the time we get to that point, unemployment might be down into kind of the 4% to 5% range, which then creates a whole another wave of needs for employers in terms of finding talent and kind of fighting for talents over. So it feels to us like this is a multiyear cycle here where employers are going to be really scrambling to find people. I think that generally creates conversation opportunities. So we don\u2019t have a magic formula necessary, and necessarily, we\u2019re not a staffing firm. But we do have tools and we have technology, and we have people that can help our clients be more competitive as they look for solutions, as they look for the right employees in the right place at the right time at the right pay level. That\u2019s our sweet spot. And so I\u2019d say we\u2019re right in the middle of this, what I would call, super cycle of demand for labor that is probably short-term related to kind of friction where people are just not in the right places and people are probably also some -- there\u2019s some hesitation, still there\u2019s issues with childcare and eldercare, there\u2019s a number of factors. It is -- we assume like other economists that this will be -- that part will be transitory, but that the need for people will not be, given just the obvious low unemployment rate, which we will be at by the end of, call it, calendar year 2022. James Faucette : That\u2019s really helpful, Carlos. And then just as it relates to sales productivity, you highlighted that on your -- you\u2019re expecting and seeing improvement there. At the same time -- and you indicated that there, you\u2019re being able to get your salespeople in front of more accounts and potential accounts. How closely tied do you expect those two things to be as we go through the rest of the fiscal year? Carlos Rodriguez : Again, this -- we\u2019re uncharted territory. It\u2019s a little hard to give a scientific answer, because this last year, we were not able to get in front of a lot of our process, actually most of our process until recently. And yeah, we delivered, I would say, very solid and strong bookings results. So I think some of this is really about us being able to adapt, which is our job to what the market wants, right, what the clients want and what the prospects want. And the fact of the matter is that about half of our -- half of the workforce out there, which probably translates into half of our clients, they actually kept going to workplaces, they kept making things, delivering things and going to workplaces. The rest of the some of us white collar employees didn\u2019t. So that segment of the prospects and clients, they expect us to be available, if they want us to meet with them in person. We\u2019re not going to go force anyone to meet in person. We\u2019re happy to meet them if they want to be met, whether it\u2019s virtually, online or in person. But we want to be ready for whatever the market wants and for whatever the market demands and that\u2019s exactly our plan. But to answer your question, it\u2019s really hard to know which factor is the most important factor. We think that being able and willing and available to meet in person with prospects is an important element of our sales success for fiscal 2022. But I can\u2019t really put a number on it because we were successful in 2021 without doing that. Kathleen Winters : Yeah. I think the key is that we\u2019re going to have to make sure we can continue to be nimble just as we were in fiscal 2021, right? If there are certain regions or points in time where we might have to scale back a little bit in the face-to-face, I think we\u2019re nimble enough to do that. We\u2019ve proven we could do that. But we\u2019re certainly ready and have been out there doing face-to-face and hope that that continues. James Faucette : Thanks, Kathleen. Thanks, Carlos. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Your line is now open. Dan Dolev : Hey, guys. Great results. Thanks for taking my questions. So, can you discuss how the retention has varied by sort of the three ES by the three sub-segments, SMB, mid-market and up market? And what happens to the SMBs once the PPP rolls off, so how should we think about kind of your guidance for retention versus like those three vectors? And then I have a very short follow up? Thanks. Carlos Rodriguez : That\u2019s a good question. I think, Kathleen, may probably have a little bit of additional color. But I would tell you that, this -- I think your insinuation that the PPP loans may have something to do with these elevated retention rates is something that we\u2019ve heard kind of out there in the -- in terms of as a buzz. And again, that\u2019s very hard to, like, put our finger on in terms of how to quantify that and what\u2019s the impact? But for sure, one of the strongest areas we\u2019ve had in retention is our down market business and that is why I think we\u2019ve prudently planned for some give back on that next year. Having said that, I will tell you that, this year, fiscal 2021 and the two months before that were probably the greatest example of ADP\u2019s business model in terms of ability to deliver. Now we call it service, you can call it compliance and call it whatever you want, but when the chips were down and people needed help and needed to talk to someone about their PPP loan and they weren\u2019t calling their banker, they didn\u2019t have to apply for a loan and they didn\u2019t have to go through a bank, but you can go do your own channel checks to see how many banks were actually answering the phone or giving people advice, because they were completely overwhelmed as we were, but we actually figured out a way to handle it and we were there for our clients. And so, I think that, what we just did over the last year and I get it I\u2019m a pragmatist, so memories are short and we have to continue to impress and continue to deliver for our clients. But I think we just proved to hundreds of thousands of clients, and hopefully, the prospects from a reputation standpoint that if you want to have someone who\u2019s a partner, if ADP, if you want software, you can buy software. But if you want great technology and great software, but you want someone who\u2019s going to be able to deliver on the service side, then you should be with ADP. And so I think that that\u2019s going to have some -- there\u2019s going to be some factor and hopefully allowing us to hold on to some of this retention on a more permanent basis, because I think the -- when the chips were down, I think, people saw the difference between not having someone that you could get help from and having someone that you can reach out to and get advice and get your problems -- major problem solved. But the bottomline is, we clearly are prudent and aware that some of this normalization could result in some lower retention rates, particularly in the down market, as you are, I think, alluding to. Kathleen Winters : Yeah. I mean, that\u2019s covered a lot of. In fiscal 2021, look, we saw strong retention across almost all of our channels, our businesses, particularly in small business and mid-market as well, though, and even actually on the international side where the retention is very high. We thought it\u2019s a little bit higher there as well, too. So, pretty much strong across the Board. But look, we want to be prudent from a planning perspective and while we haven\u2019t seen any change yet in terms of switching or along those lines. I do think it\u2019s prudent to plan that there\u2019s going to be, I\u2019ll call it, a little bit of give back in fiscal 2022. I think we are going to hold on to some of the games. We\u2019re certainly attempting to do that. We want to do that. But I do think it\u2019s prudent to plan for a little bit of give back, which we\u2019ve done and that would be primarily with regard to small business segment normalizing back to pre-pandemic levels. Carlos Rodriguez : But to be clear, there\u2019s no -- I\u2019m not aware of a particular -- there\u2019s nothing that ties a client to us or anyone else because of the PPP loans. What I\u2019ve heard the theory that some people have somehow some kind of psychological thing that it\u2019ll just make things more difficult if you switch and I -- I\u2019m obviously not a small business owner. So we talk to small business owners. We\u2019re just not hearing that. But it feels logical that could be a factor of that. But to be clear, there is no particular trigger that on November 15th we\u2019re going to lose 100,000 clients because their PPP loans have been repaid or expired. That\u2019s not the way the program work. Dan Dolev : Understood. And then my quick follow up and I think it\u2019s somewhat ties to this is the margin guidance. What I\u2019m hearing this morning from investors is, it might be -- I don\u2019t know maybe slight, maybe light of expectations. I mean, is that somewhat tied to the mix shift next year or is there anything else that you could call out on the margin guidance? Thanks. Carlos Rodriguez : Well, listen, after 10 years of doing this, I\u2019ve never heard anyone say that your margin guidance was too aggressive and too high. So let me just start off with that comment. And part of that is that we\u2019re always trying to balance short-term and long-term investors. I\u2019m not sure which one you were hearing from. But our intent here is to continue the machine, right, and the momentum that has led to multiple decades here of compounded growth and creation of value over a very long period of time and that requires delivering short-term results, as well as long-term results. And those long-term results, I think, require some investment including on the R&D side. But in particular this year, really the biggest factor is selling expense and sales investment, which has happened to us in the past, we\u2019ve had other times and call it 2000, 2001 or 2002 and then, 2008, 2009, 2010, because I was around for those, where as we reaccelerate and take advantage of demand back to the secular growth opportunity. The way our business model works is we incur a lot of upfront selling and implementation expense. Now there\u2019s some accounting rules that allow you to defer some of that. But generally speaking, you get elevated selling expenses and implementation expenses, and it\u2019s pretty significant. So I would say that that is a significant part of what would have maybe otherwise been higher margins for 2022. But when that business then is on the books, that\u2019s a high incremental margin business that then in 2023, 2024 and then for the next 12 years to 13 years, that\u2019s how long we keep our clients on average creates an annuity. So as you can imagine, we never turn down the incremental opportunity to add business, never, because it is just the way the value creation model works. And we\u2019re going to make hay while the sun is shining here. And with 6%, 7% GDP growth last quarter and what\u2019s likely to be incredibly strong GDP in the next year or two, we\u2019re going to take every possible opportunity. And unfortunately, that requires some selling expense and some implementation expense in addition to the ongoing investments in technology and some of the other things that we do. Kathleen Winters : Yeah. So just big picture when you think about margin for next year and we\u2019re very happy that we\u2019re able to kind of guide to the 25 basis points to 50 basis points of margin expansion, I mean, look, we always look to do better than the plan, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re comfortable with. Right now, the way to think about it is, look, we\u2019re going to have operating leverage to a greater extent in fiscal 2022, obviously, but we\u2019ve also got the investments that we want to continue to make, as Carlos just articulated, in product, in sales and in digital transformation importantly. And we do have some offsets, Carlos mentioned, the sales expense. But we also have things like, Return to Office and ramping up T&E versus what we were -- where we were in fiscal 2021. So kind of all that goes into the mix, net-net, we\u2019ve got this 25 basis points to 50 basis points margin expansion. We\u2019re going to do our best to deliver on that and continue to work our digital transformation and if possible do even more. Carlos Rodriguez : And one -- just one other factor, because if you have any doubts about ADP\u2019s ability to drive margin, just one small thing hasn\u2019t come up yet. But we had this like small little problem this year with interest rates, where it created $110 million headwind to net contribution and 100 -- almost $125 million in topline and bottomline in terms of client funds interest revenue. So our revenue growth would have been almost a point higher and our margin for this year in a pandemic would have been up 70 basis points instead of downside 40 basis points, had we not had that headwind. Now, we did have a headwind. So it\u2019s always hard to say, if we didn\u2019t have this and we didn\u2019t have that. But that\u2019s a pretty easy thing to isolate that has no operational -- nothing to do with operations, we have no control over and we have to just ride that cyclical wave, which hopefully that\u2019s cyclical wave is heading in a very positive direction for us over the next two years to three years. But just want to make sure you understood that, because I think that tells you just how much control we have over our expenses and over our business model and over our long-term value creation objectives. Kathleen Winters : And that perhaps our  interest does continue to be headwind for us in fiscal 2022, very modest headwinds, compared to what we experienced in fiscal 2021, but it doesn\u2019t help us, whereas in your past, it was a significant help to us. Dan Dolev : Got it. Thank you for the detail. Appreciate it. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is now open. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on your comments on retention and you\u2019re prudently planning for retention to increase if the market normalizes whether it does or not we\u2019ll see. But can you describe your toolkit on the sales or technology side that you can use to prevent attrition and I\u2019m sure a lot depends on the underlying sort of reasons for the attrition. But can you be more proactive on that front and sort of stem the tide of it if push comes to shove? Carlos Rodriguez : Absolutely. I think, and again, I -- we probably have a couple of examples we could give of things that we\u2019ve done over the last year. But it\u2019s usually a methodical multiyear approach to making our products like, when we talk about innovation. Innovation is partly about new business bookings, but it\u2019s also about making our solutions easy to use and more intuitive. And you\u2019ve heard in our comments and we shouldn\u2019t gloss over it, like, the UX experienced investments we\u2019ve made in both RUN, but now in some of our other platforms is a significant factor in today\u2019s world of whether or not a client sticks with you or not. So we get that. That\u2019s why, however, many years ago, we kind of got it, and we said, we need to become a technology company in addition to the services company that we are in. So I\u2019d say, number one is, you have to have great products, they have to be easy to use, and they have to have no friction. That will help with retention. I think the other things that I think you can point to are really just around availability. So our business model and our promise is not just technology and software, but it\u2019s to help with compliance and is to help with advice and is to provide expertise. And that really means that we have to have well trained associates, who are there to answer questions, whether it\u2019s chat, whether it\u2019s by phone, it doesn\u2019t matter, however, the client wants to reach us, but the stuff we do is complicated. And being an employer is complicated. And it requires help and you need to get the help from us or you can call an attorney, or you can call a consultant. But most people do not just do this stuff on their own and we happen to package the two things together, great technology with great service. So I say, if we have great technology and we have great service, we\u2019re going to be able to hold on to hopefully a lot of that improvement we\u2019ve had in retention, even if we have a little bit of give back in the down market. Ramsey El-Assal: I see. Just not a question of running analytics at the right time, it\u2019s really more of a longer term kind of blocking and tackling and product innovation approach. Carlos Rodriguez : We run plenty of analytics too. So we have -- for example, we have a lot of data around, like, we track individual clients, how many times they call. We actually can monitor we have voice recognition that tells us, certain, keywords that people use when they\u2019re, because we record all phone calls and that really gives us deep insight into clients that are at risk. And then we have special teams that can follow up with those clients to make sure that whatever problem they had has been resolved. But that\u2019s -- I would call that trench warfare, which -- if you want to get into those details, I can go in the trenches with you. But we have very deep analytical tools that really give us a lot of insight. Like, for example, in our down market, I mean, our clients don\u2019t call that often, because hopefully they don\u2019t have problems very often, because we do a nice job of preventing problems. But one of our small business clients has -- we detect has multiple calls in a month, that requires a reach out to that client or a deeper investigation and a triage to make sure that we don\u2019t lose that client, because that\u2019s usually a sign that there\u2019s something wrong with that client. And we have other techniques and other approaches and other tools to identify what we would call hotspots. We also monitor pricing very carefully when we do our price changes, which I guess is code for price increases. We do that very carefully using a lot of analytical tools to make sure that we do that in the smartest possible way, if you will, to maximize retention. Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. Thanks for that. And a quick follow up for me. How would you characterize the demand environment for off cycle or on-demand payrolls, is it something that that you see getting quite a bit more popular or it will sort of remain kind of a niche service over time? Carlos Rodriguez : No. I mean, it\u2019s clearly popular, because I know a lot of people are talking about it and so that always leads to popularity, right? As soon as someone talks about it, it becomes popular. I think that it\u2019s, again, like, a lot of things we\u2019ve been saying over the last two years or three years, so many things are inevitable are going to happen and we\u2019re preparing for them. So things like real time payroll. In this one that you\u2019re referring to is kind of one that we just heard over the last couple of days. I think that we\u2019ve been thinking about for many, many years and we have solutions, where if someone needs to get paid, like, for example, in California, if someone is terminated from their job, you have to give them their final paycheck like immediately and so that is difficult to do through the normal process. So we have solutions for that we\u2019ve had for quite some time. And so I think the increasing popularity is probably more related to increasing discussion about it, but also to technological advances that allow more options, right in terms of instant payments and/or faster payments. So I would say the answer is, yes. That is an important thing. And for certain sectors, like, if you have a high turnover, hourly workforce, your ability to provide that solution is crucial. But we have that ability to provide that solution. But you can\u2019t, for example, sell a client in California and not be able to provide instant pay upon termination. So it\u2019s -- you have to have that. Ramsey El-Assal: Got it. All right. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Your line is now open. Bryan Bergin : Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Can you talk about how you\u2019re thinking about the cadence of the pays per control projecting, you\u2019ve assumed during fiscal 2022? And what does the 45% build imply in the base relative to pre-pandemic levels? Carlos Rodriguez : We\u2019re digging for that. I think the quarterly -- I mean, again, it\u2019s probably, when you look at the comps, the fourth quarter will have weaker than expected growth. But I don\u2019t know, Dan, if you have the\u2026 Danyal Hussain : Yeah. Bryan, it\u2019s just a mirror image of what we saw effectively last year. And so there\u2019s a stronger Q1 performance PPC that\u2019s baked into our assumptions and it gradually tails off. But we don\u2019t have an explicit guidance for you on what this means for reported unemployment rate, the same way that we gave you that guidance last year at the outset. Carlos Rodriguez : And the average for the year for pays control, I am going to refresh my memory is\u2026 Danyal Hussain : 4% to 5%... Carlos Rodriguez : 4% to 5%. Kathleen Winters : Yeah. Carlos Rodriguez : So you -- I would anticipate, if I were you, I would probably assume that for the fourth quarter is going to be back to, I don\u2019t know, 2%, 3% or somewhere low -- somewhere in the lower range. Danyal Hussain : Absolutely. Carlos Rodriguez : Because we\u2019re growing over the 8% and in the first three quarters, particularly the first quarter it\u2019ll be higher. Bryan Bergin : Okay. And follow up then on M&A. How are you thinking about areas of potential acquisitions for capabilities? And then also, can you comment on how the market has been for book of business acquisitions, curious COVID has changed that dynamic during fiscal 2021 and then to fiscal 2022? Carlos Rodriguez : We\u2019ve had actually pretty good success in terms of client base acquisitions. You -- again, you\u2019re right, that I myself was surprised that there was an opportunity to do that and then we were able to execute on it. But we had one that I think we mentioned last year, in the fourth quarter and kind of spilled a little bit over into the first quarter, but it was mostly I think fourth quarter. We had one the year before that, that was significant also in the fourth quarter. And in this year, we\u2019ve had a number of, what I would call, smaller ones, but they add up. And so I would say that the news there is good and is ongoing and we\u2019ve created a nice ability to do these conversions and make it good for us in terms of growth. And back to the question around cross-sell, we usually have a much broader set of solutions than other people that we are making these acquisitions from, which creates upside opportunity, right, in terms of value creation for us. On the kind of overall M&A comment side, I would say that, we\u2019ve -- where we\u2019ve been most active is looking in some of our international locations in markets, where I think we have very little market share and we still have needs, for example, for add-on products, whereas in the U.S., we\u2019re not really looking to add additional platforms for either benefits or payroll and so forth. So it really has to be things that are adjacent, right, in the HCM space, but not duplicative, because as you know, we\u2019ve been on this kind of simplification push for many, many years and trying to build things organically and invest in technology organically. So that doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t acquire because we have and a couple years -- we haven\u2019t done anything for a couple of years. But we do welcome the opportunity to add additional ancillary benefits as long as they fit into our technology roadmap and they\u2019re not disruptive or add-on and we\u2019re not doing it just to get the quote-unquote revenue pop. But on the international side, we typically don\u2019t have those factors at play as much and that\u2019s a place where we\u2019re still excited and we still see a lot of greenfield opportunity to expand through M&A. Bryan Bergin : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Kartik Mehta : Good morning, Carlos. You talked about the PEO business, obviously, it performed well in the fourth quarter and seems like trends are coming back. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ve seen any secular changes, I know that word maybe you don\u2019t like, but any secular changes in demand for the product, or if you anticipate any changes, because what we\u2019ve gone through with COVID? Carlos Rodriguez : I mean, again, my experience tells me that, because I actually ran a business for many years at ADP and now I\u2019ve been watching it for, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to say this for 25 years. And when you get into this kind of economic environment, it\u2019s usually a positive secular tailwind for, I guess, back to like, sometime I don\u2019t like that word. But I would say that there have been positive secular trends for the PEO for 20 years to 30 years. And then they can get enhanced, I think, by cyclical factors, like, a strong economy. Like, so people sometimes say that the PEO will do well or outsourcing will do well, when there\u2019s a recession, because people are looking to save money and that -- there\u2019s some truth to that. But it\u2019s not what the data supports or shows, right? It\u2019s usually when you have very strong economic growth and strong GDP and people are scrambling for talent and they\u2019re competing for offering the right benefits. That\u2019s when PEOs and outsourcing tend to, I think, do better. So I would say that, based on experience, which you have to discount, because we just went through a pandemic. So most of our experiences, we should park somewhere outside the door, because we may end up being wrong. But all things being equal this kind of economic environment is usually very strong for the PEO. And as for the last 18 months, what we saw there is, it\u2019s a long cycle sale and it\u2019s a high involvement decision. So I think we\u2019ve been clear that, we\u2019ve had good great results there from a booking standpoint, and probably, better than we would have thought was possible, but definitely not as strong as yet in kind of the early stages of the recovery of our bookings. We expect that to reverse and that is our plan in 2022. In other words, we expect very strong bookings and strong recovery on the PEO. And we\u2019re seeing some signs of that in the fourth quarter, because what happened is in this kind of hunkering down mode, we saw very high retention in our PEO, but not as much. It was more difficult to sell new clients, but the existing clients. I mean, it was unbelievable value that we delivered to them and because it was beyond just PPP loans. It was -- how do I downsize my workforce or how do I put people on furlough and what are the rules in this state around benefits. I mean, our people were busy. I mean all of our people or all of ADP were busy this year, while maybe other people were less busy, but our people were busy and in the PEO, they were extra busy. So I think that that bodes well. And those anecdotal stories and that reputation along with kind of some of these cyclical tailwinds, I think, bode well for the PEO here in the next year or two. Kartik Mehta : And just as a follow up on the ES business, have you had to do anything out of the ordinary in terms of price competition or just providing promotions? Carlos Rodriguez : Have we done anything, are you saying or is the market? Kartik Mehta : Yeah. I guess have you had to do anything to come from because of what competition has done? So have you had to do anything out of the ordinary on the ES business? Carlos Rodriguez : No. Kartik Mehta : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is now open. Mark Marcon : Hey. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for squeezing me in. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the strong bookings performance and just unpacking that, in terms of, where you -- I heard the 50-50 mix in terms of upsells versus new logos. But as it relates to new logos, where were you seeing the strongest success, was that down market in terms of the new business formations, was that across the Board and who do you think you were winning the most against? Carlos Rodriguez : Well, we would always squeeze you in Mark. There\u2019s no question about that. A couple of highlights. We think we mentioned in our prepared comments, but our non-PEO HRO solution. So these would be kind of mid-market and upmarket outsourcing solutions that are, what I would call more comprehensive, if you will. Really or probably one of the real highlights and I think that was, again, related probably to people realizing, probably, within months after the pandemic that, like this stuff is hard to do, especially if you have to pivot very quickly, right? You have to make sure your systems are still up like you can\u2019t have a server in a closet somewhere that you\u2019re using to run payroll, because you still do this internally. And then people who go to the office to key in the payroll, like this stuff is just a lot of people all of a sudden woke up and realized, from a business continuity standpoint and from a support standpoint, I need help, there needs to be more than just the software, right, and basic service. So these HRO solutions really were an incredible bright spot. And then, I think, definitely mentioned, our upmarket and our ESI bookings results were also very, very strong. Yes, new business formation helped in the down market and we\u2019re very -- like we\u2019re pleased with all of our results on booking side. It was across the Board very strong performance. But I would say that there were other places that had even stronger. When I talked about GlobalView, our Tax Filing and Compliance business, which does a lot of standalone business, where again, companies realize that having a bunch of people subscale doing this stuff, you don\u2019t even know where they are and if they can get to the office or if they can do it from home, but it\u2019s mission critical, are looking to outsource or did outsource a lot of that stuff to us. And then we did have a couple of, what I would call, volume-based businesses, like, employment verification and screening and a couple of things that, RPO also came back a little bit. But it was really across the Board, honestly, like. So those are a couple of just like\u2026 Kathleen Winters : Yeah. Like a strong across the Board, Carlos said all those right points, in particular SBS really led the way, down market really led the way in recovery during the course of the years. And in fact, and you can correct me if I\u2019m wrong on this, but I believe SBS had their biggest Q4 ever, including the Retirement and Insurance Solutions. Carlos Rodriguez : Yeah. I wrote it down somewhere, but I can\u2019t find it. I think we had records Q4 bookings in a number of different categories. But that\u2019s also probably happens over the years to, where we have so many things were so broad, that there\u2019s always a few bright spots. But honestly, compared to what we would have expected the beginning of this year, really, to be saying we had record bookings in any business line is really good news. Mark Marcon : Okay. That\u2019s fantastic. And just with regards to the new logos, in terms of if there wasn\u2019t moving to an outsourcing solution that was previously done in-house, was there any sort of commonality with regards to competitive takeaways and wins that you ended up seeing as a source? Carlos Rodriguez : I mean, I say that, when I looked -- when I look at the -- we call the balance of trade data. I would say that we -- again, I\u2019d like to think we\u2019re doing a little bit better. We don\u2019t provide a lot of color and disclosure around, because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful and I\u2019m not looking to pick a fight with any specific competitor. But I would say that we\u2019re pleased with our progress, like, we need the combination of stronger retention, which means we lose less to some of those competitors that you\u2019re talking about and our strong bookings performance means we won more against some of those competitors. I think you\u2019d probably paint the picture that there\u2019s probably a few competitors where a balance of trade improved, which it did. And admittedly, in some couple of competitors, it didn\u2019t, right, it stayed. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s really any place where we went backwards, that I\u2019m aware, I\u2019m trying to think back. But I think the balanced trade situation, we\u2019re very focused on this, we\u2019re trying to become more focused on logos and units and more focused on our competitors, because our competitors are focused on us and we\u2019re sick and tired of it. Mark Marcon : Understood. And then, along those lines, you\u2019ve made a number of product enhancements. Can you highlight it, a number of them, including in terms of Workforce Solutions, Workforce Planning, time and attendance? And then, obviously, highlighting Next Gen Payroll, just wondering, which ones do you think are going to have the greatest incremental contribution? I know it\u2019s all leads to sales force productivity, but just, which ones should we look for the greatest benefit from? Carlos Rodriguez : Well, that\u2019s a tough one, because it\u2019s like picking your favorite child. Kathleen Winters : Yeah. I mean, I have a view. I think what we do\u2026 Carlos Rodriguez : Yeah. Kathleen Winters : \u2026 from an investment perspective in ongoing kind of refresh and modernization, and you act on all of our strategic platforms is critical. And we\u2019re doing that all the time and that\u2019s just critical to our ongoing satisfaction with our products, as we talked about earlier and our NPS score. So that constant refresh from a UX perspective is really, really important. But, Carlos, you may have other things you want to just highlight\u2026 Carlos Rodriguez : No. I think that\u2019s well said, because I\u2019m excited about all of them. I think that the Next Gen Payroll is literally could be the biggest mover in the last multiple decades for ADP for us. But it really -- it\u2019s really Workforce Now and Roll and other things that are in front of it that are critical and visible, right, because that\u2019s really just an engine to gross net engine. But the added flexibility that it provides and the process improvement that it provides in the back office could be a step change game changer for ADP in terms of our competitiveness and in terms of our efficiency. But the truth is, stay client focus, I think, Kathleen is right. The most important thing the client sees is what they interact with, right? And I think that is mostly around the UX and our front end solution. So I think that\u2019s probably the right place to focus. Mark Marcon : Great. This Next Gen Payroll, what\u2019s the plan for this year in terms of percentage of Workforce Now that ends up getting converted or that should be on it? Carlos Rodriguez : We\u2019re not really -- we\u2019re probably dabbling in a few conversions, definitely not our number one priority yet. We started kind of in the lower end of our mid-market to begin with. So in call it the 50 to 150 is where we\u2019re really, we call it core major accounts kind of in the lower end of major accounts. And we\u2019re pretty happy as you can tell from our tone and what we\u2019ve talked about in the last couple of quarters with our progress there. And we have a plan. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really great for us to share it, because I think competitors listen to these calls, too. But we have a very methodical plan to eventually get to 100% of our core sales being a Next Gen Payroll, while at the same time, then gradually moving into the other parts of major accounts call it the 150 to 1000 and then selling 100% of those clients on to Next Gen Payroll. And then as we\u2019re going along, we will start some conversions. But it\u2019s not a huge priority for us, and remember Workforce Now is the front end on both of these. And this is all intended to be transparent. This is not one of those migrations that you heard about five years, seven years ago at ADP where we disrupt everything and that the clients are going to see very little change other than some enhancements in terms of self service capabilities. And other things that, obviously, we think are going to be net positives from both a selling and a client retention standpoint. But generally speaking, their experience will not change in a significant way. Mark Marcon : Terrific. Congratulations. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos Rodriguez : Well, thanks. I appreciate everybody joining the call today. I think in the prepared comments we talked about what a year this has been. I\u2019m sure every company has the same view in terms of the challenges that they faced. But I\u2019m just incredibly grateful to our associates for what they did, first and foremost, for our clients. When the chips were down, we really delivered. It started, obviously, in the fourth quarter of last year with all the government regulation changes that needed to be put in place and the huge volume of inquiries we were getting about PPP loans, et cetera. But it really continued into this fiscal year as well. And it was just an incredibly challenging environment, while people have personal challenges, right, including health challenges in their family. And so, again, I\u2019m just -- I look back to, we\u2019re a mission driven company and you can see it in the in the culture and I\u2019m grateful for my predecessors and the culture that was built over all these decades that allowed us to, it wasn\u2019t without incident and it wasn\u2019t easy, but we really got through it. I think we delivered for our clients. We delivered for the economy, because we are a mission critical service in the economy. And I just couldn\u2019t be prouder of our associates including our back office associates to support our frontline associates, as well as our sales force, who, as we talked about a lot today, continue to plow through and allow us to continue to grow our business, despite we\u2019re unprecedented headwinds. So, but first and foremost, I\u2019m just so glad that despite, obviously, we have some short-term challenges here with the new Delta variant and so forth. But I mean, clearly, we\u2019re heading in the right direction and we are very optimistic both for ourselves, for our families, for our associates and for our clients and we look forward to better times ahead here over the next couple of quarters where inevitably we\u2019ll have some ups and downs or some challenges here and there. But it\u2019s great that everything is on the right track at least in the United States and we\u2019re hoping that other parts of the world follow closely behind, given that we have very significant business in Europe, Asia and Latin America as well. And we appreciate your interest in ADP and your support and thank you for tuning in today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Michelle and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's First Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the conference over to Mr. Daniel Hussain, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Danyal Hussain : Thank you Michelle. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to ADP's first quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings calls. Participating today are Carlos Rodriguez, our President and CEO and Don Maguire, our CFO. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call. During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe is useful to investors. And that includes the impact of certain items. A description of these items along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release. Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements, that refer to future events and involve some risks. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results, to differ materially from our current expectations. And with that, let me turn it over to Carlos. Thank you, Danny. And thank you, everyone for joining our call. I'd like to start by welcoming Don Mcguire, our new CFO. Don has been with ADP since 1998, when he joined the ADP Canada Team as a VP of Finance. He's held a series of roles with increasing responsibility, most recently serving as President of our international business, where he's done a phenomenal job of driving growth and profitability in a very complex environment. I know he's looking forward to meeting all of you. Carlos Rodriguez : Now, moving on to the quarter. We're pleased to have delivered a very strong start to the year with 10% revenue growth and 140 basis points of margin expansion, resulting in 17% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. While we did expect our Q1 revenue growth to be above our prior full-year guidance range, this result was still above our initial forecast and underscores the strong position, we are in as we emerge from the pandemic. I'll let Don go through the details after I cover some highlights. Our ES new business bookings results for very strong, representing another record Q1 bookings amount. And we're ahead of our expectations, but our performance driven by continued strength in our HR portfolio, in our international business. With this impressive bookings performance across the enterprise, we're pleased to raise our ES bookings guidance for the year after just one quarter, as we're now feeling even more confident about our sales momentum. Even stronger was our CEO bookings performance, which was also well ahead of our expectations.  And a key reason that we are raising our guidance for average worksite employee growth for the year, as Don will outline for you. As you will recall, we have been sharing our sales productivity trends over the course of the pandemic and I'm pleased to report that in Q1 we were well above pre -pandemic levels. We reached this result several months sooner than we expected, and we expect us to continue as we look ahead. Our ES retention remained incredibly strong as well. As we shared last quarter, we believed it was reasonable to assume a slight step back and retention from the record 92.2% level we experienced last year.  But in Q1, we did not see meaningful deterioration. Instead, we actually saw further improvement in our overall ES retention to a new record Q1 level, despite amongst decline in our small business division, where out of business losses started to trend back to more normal levels compared to the below normal levels last year. We're continuing to assume a slight decline in our retention outlook for the year. But clearly, we are pleased with our performance so far in the upward revision in our retention outlook reflect the strong Q1 performance. Our ESP pays per control was solid with 7% growth in the quarter, about in line with our expectations. We feel that a number of questions these pass over months about what we think might drive workers back until the labor force. While we don't have an answer to that question, what we can tell you is that we continue to see positive trends. Our clients are eager to hire and we are seeing workers returned to the labor force, even if it's gradual. As a result, we expect to benefit from above-normal and above-normal level of pays per control growth over the course of the year. In addition to the very strong ES performance, our PEO delivered another stellar quarter with 15% revenue growth and 15% average worksite - employee growth.  Even better than the high expectations we had coming into the quarter. There were multiple drivers to the outlook performance in the PEO, including the strong level of hiring within the client base, resilient retention, and the improved bookings performance I mentioned earlier. We're very pleased with the momentum we see building in the PEO. And we're raising our full-year guidance accordingly. In addition to the financial highlights, there are a few product highlights I wanted to share with you. First, I'm excited to share that we completed the initial roll out of our new user experience for RUN. As we shared with you last quarter, this represents the most comprehensive refresh we've done since the launch of RUN. And we're very proud that in a matter of a quarter, we were able to seamlessly move hundreds of thousands of clients to a new and better user experience. Early signs indicate the client satisfaction scores to trend even higher than the record levels we already have in our small business division. So it's a really great outcome and represents a very strong execution by the team. I'd like to also share that at the Annual HR Tech Conference a few weeks ago, our innovative diversity, equity and inclusion tool on a DataCloud platform was named a top HR product. This recognition adds to ADP's longstanding history of award wins at the conference, marking an unprecedented seven consecutive year ADP has been honored for its innovative HCM Technology. You can probably talk from the number of times we've highlighted DataCloud that our velocity of innovation has increased significantly there. With this  solution as an example, we've seen over 50% of active users of the solution take action and realized positive impact on their  measures.  I'm proud that we provide solutions that drive real positive change for our clients. The 7 year track record demonstrates that innovation is part of ADP's DNA. And then we have a strong growing agile R&D team committed to delivering solutions in the market that continue to push the boundary of what HCM solutions can do for employers and employees. As I said before, we're very pleased with a fantastic start to the year. We look forward to sharing even more of the ADP story with you at the upcoming Investor Day in November. And now I will turn the call over to Dan for more detail on the quarter and the outlook. Don Mcguire : Thank you, Carlos and everyone on the call good morning. And nice to meet you. Our first quarter represented a strong start to the year with 10% revenue growth on both a reported and organic constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was up a 140 basis points much better than expected, and was supported by higher revenue and overall cost containment. Our tax rate was up slightly in the quarter versus last year. But we also benefited from the elevated pace of share repurchases following our debt issuance in May, combined, those factors contributed to a 17% increase in our adjusted diluted earnings per share. Moving onto the segments, our Employer Services revenue increased 8% on a reported and organic constant currency basis. Our strong Q1, ES bookings guidance performance, and record retention contributed to this performance. Though, as a reminder, we did continue to lap some of the lower revenues we had last year in some of our volume-related businesses, including recruiting and background screening. Our clients finding interest represented only a slight headwind in the quarter, as our 40 point, basis point decline in average yield was offset by fantastic balanced growth of 22%, driven by client growth and planner growth, higher wages and the lapping of the payroll tax deferral last year.  ES margin increased 150 basis points on strong revenue performance and overall cost containment. As Carlos mentioned, our PEO had another terrific quarter. Average worksite employees increased 15% year-over-year to $629,000 in revenues, excluding zero margin pass - throughs from 20%, supported once again, by favorable mix trends within the PEO employee base, as well as improving SUI rates. Total PEO revenue grew 15%, which included a modest drag from lower zero margin pass-through growth and worksite employee growth as expected. PEO margin was up 70 basis points in the quarter driven by operating leverage. Overall, our Q1 results reflect a very strong start to the year and delivered ahead of our expectations on practically all fronts. Let me now turn to our updated outlook for Fiscal 2022 for ES revenues, we now expect growth for 5% to 6% which we're raising 50 basis points at the midpoint. This is driven by several underlying factors.  We're raising our expected range of ES new bookings growth to 12 to 16%. As we mentioned, we had a better-than-expected performance in Q1 and reached pre -pandemic productivity earlier than we had fore - casted. We haven't made significant changes to our rest of year outlook at this point, but if momentum remains as strong as we've seen it then we may see opportunity to deliver additional upside. We're also raising our ES retention and we're now assuming a decline of 50 basis points off of FY21 all-time highs versus our prior outlook of a decline of 75 basis points. As with bookings, this is primarily a function of the strong Q1 performance. Our continued assumption is that as clients continue to re-engage in the marketplace, we may experience a slight decline over the course of the year. We expect to have significantly more clarity once we get through the calendar year-end period. Where we typically see most of the switching activity. For U.S. pays per control. we're making no change to our outlook of 4% to 5% growth. We continue to expect a gradual recovery in the overall labor market, and the 7% growth in Q1 was about in line with our expectations.  And then for our client funds interest revenue, we're raising our outlook by about $15 million to a range of $420 to $430 million, as we're raising our balanced growth assumptions by about 4%, to growth of 12 to 14%. Our outlook for client funds yield meanwhile is unchanged despite the improvement in the yield environment. Primarily, as our stronger balanced performance actually created a temporary mix shift to overnight investments until new securities are gradually purchased. But that said the favorable shift in the yield curve is clearly helpful to us and we'll certainly benefit our multiyear client funds outlook, all else equal.  For ES margin, we now expect an increase of about 75 to 100 basis points, up from our prior range of 50 to 75 basis points. While we did outperform meaningfully on margin in Q1, we're also seeing some additional expenses over the rest of the year, including higher headcount in our outsourcing businesses. Meanwhile, we continue to expect transformation initiative benefits, including our digital transformation to offset a year-over-year increase in facilities, T&E expenses, and other return to office expenses.  Moving onto the PEO, we now expect PEO revenues to grow 11 to 13%. Average worksite employees to grow 11 to 13% and revenues excluding 0 margin pass - throughs to grow 12 to 14%. This 2% point raise across-the-board is a function of both our strong Q1 bookings and overall performance, as well as an expectation from stronger hiring within our PEO base to contribute over the remainder of the year. RPO was very well-positioned to capitalize on growing levels of client demand coming out of the pandemic. And if we continue to drive outside booking performance over the rest of that of the year, that could represent further upside to our outlook. Following our strong start to the year, we now expect a range of flat to down 50 basis points for the year, for an improvement from our prior expectation of down 25 to 75 basis points on our margin. As a reminder, we are growing over a very strong margin results in fiscal 2021 and are also expecting elevated selling expenses this year from strong bookings performance, Turning them all together for our consolidated outlook, we now expect revenue to grow 7% to 8%. Following the strong 10% Q1 performance, we now expect the remaining quarters to grow closer to 7%, which is higher than our prior forecast.  For adjusted EBITDA margin, we now expect an increase of 50 to 75 basis points. As we shared last quarter, we expect our margin improvement to be back-half-weighted. Most specifically, in the Fourth Quarter. Our current expectation is for a slight margin decline in Q2 and Q3. We're making no change to our tax rate assumption. And with these changes, we now expect growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share of 11% to 13%, as I think you've heard us say a couple of times now we are very pleased with our Q1 results and we're happy to be raising our guidance this early in the year. This is still a dynamic environment, and there are a wide range of potential outcomes. And we believe our guidance is appropriately balanced given these conditions. However, should our associates continue to drive better-than-expected sales results, client satisfaction, efficiency, and service and implementation. We would see opportunity to deliver additional upside to our outlook. Before to move in Q&A I wanted to share 2 things. First, I look forward to meeting everyone perhaps virtually for now. But eventually in-person as we get back out on the road to meet our shareholders and the investment community. And second is that we are very much looking forward to our upcoming Investor Day in a couple of weeks on November 15th. Having run one of our largest businesses for years, I can tell you there is always much happening here at ADP on the ground. And although it all tends to roll up to a very stable financial picture, I can tell you there's a lot of excitement among our associates for the things they're working on. We hope to share some of that excitement with you in November. And with that, I will now turn it back over to the Operator for Q&A. Operator :  We'll take our first question from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is open. Samad Samana : Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my questions, congrats on the really strong start to the new fiscal year. So Carlos, maybe I want unpack the drivers to the strength on the new bookings side, I know productivity is clearly one, but how should we think about -- how should we think about the product side and within the product portfolio where that strength was in terms of driving new bookings? Carlos Rodriguez : So we -- even though what we really talked about is ES bookings, just want to start by saying that the PEO Bookings were incredibly strong. I don't know how else to put it. So I call it orders of magnitude in terms of growth rate higher than even the ES bookings growth for the quarter. That was really good to see.  So that's kind of a sign to your question about products that I think the market is really searching for solutions coming out of this pandemic, that helped them with obviously people issues and sort of, but there's also a talent for -- so people are looking to obviously attract and retain people in this environment where every Company, including ADP, is going through some of these challenged in terms of retracting our own internal talent. And then you have another dynamic which is, if there are shortages of labor in various categories there we're hearing that there's also shortages of talent in kind of HCM category in general that should create a little bit of an advantage for the clinical outsourcers, right? So as you know, our model is, we provide great technology and software, but we also do the back-office work and we take accountability for outcomes. And I think when people are struggling to hire people to do the work in their HR department, or their payroll department, or their benefits department, we're here to help.  And so I think those outsourcing solutions are getting a lot of tailwind. We also saw because of the easy comps and I think you've heard it in Dan 's comments. Some of the things like our recruitment process outsourcing business and our screening and selection business, which we're really at very low booking levels last year at the same time, have rebounded off for obvious reasons, incredibly well. But having said that, it was really across the board. We had very strong growth in workforce. Now, we had very strong growth in the up-market. We had strong growth even in a down-market. Although last at the same time, I think we mentioned that we had when we call client-base acquisition which is not technically M&A deal, but we were able to buy and large book of business that we converted, that really some of that flowed through our bookings. So I'd made that comparison a little harder on the SBS side, but if you back that out, it was equally strong on the SBS side as well. I would say that could give you a little bit of color, but it really was across the board.  It just shows how connected we are to the economy and GDP when it comes to bookings, which is something that we've had the theory here for some -- for some years now, and we just have a very strong recovery in a very strong economy. And it's a great environment for our sales force. Samad Samana : That's very helpful. And then, Don Maguire, maybe one for you on the retention side. So obviously it's -- it's really impactful into to raise the outlook one quarter and I think signals the strength that you're seeing. But just help unpack the slight uptick in the SMB side moving a little bit more towards normal in terms of business failure. Should we think that the offset there is even better-than-expected retention in the mid-market, or on the enterprise side? Can you maybe help us think about it across the customer size spectrum? How to balance those different moving parts? Don Mcguire : Yes. Sure. I think it's fair to say and we commented on it that the retention is at an all-time record for our Q1. So that's fantastic and better than we had expected. The expectation as we went into the year was to see particularly in the smaller business statement, to see that slipped back a little. And indeed it has, but it hasn't slipped back nearly to the extent that we had anticipated.  So we're even better there against what we had previously thought. Of course, then that means that we did have and continue to have good retention levels in the mid-market and the upmarket. So we expect that to -- we expect that to continue. However, as you know the cyclicality of our business and the seasonality of our business. We will need to get through the calendar year end, which is when we see most of the switching activity because of the drivers in new starts the year etc. So we are positive and we did take our retention estimate up for the year and we'll see if it holds and perhaps it's better than we expected. Samad Samana : Great, thanks. And I look forward to seeing at the stand person and a few weeks. Don Mcguire : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please proceed. Jason Kupferberg : Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. This is actually may hear about on for Jason. Don, firstly, congratulations on the role. Maybe you can talk a little bit about your priorities in the CFO role and how they could maybe look a little different than on the . And just relatedly, should we expect an update, the multiyear targets at next year's Analyst Day. And then I have a follow-up. Thank you. Don Mcguire : Yes. So I guess what I would say is I've been with ADP for a long time now. And I guess what I observed in the roughly 23 years I've been with this Company is that ADP has always had a very strong financial organization with a strong finance leader. And I want to make sure that we continue that. I am sure we will. I think that the priorities that we have are well set out in our Strat plan previous Investor Days, etc. So we'll probably provide along with an update on those things that when we get together on November the 15th. But let's wait until then and I don't think you're going to see any dramatic changes. We pretty much have a well-discussed, and well-disclosed trajectory, and plan, and we will update you on that on November the 15th. Jason Kupferberg : Understood. Thank you. And then just if I could ask about just sales for spend, just clearly seeing some very strong momentum in the market. So I was wondering if you have any plans for sales force growth in Fiscal 2022? And which part of the market those ads would be concentrated in. Also anything notable to call out in terms of just the mix of new logos versus cross-sells in your bookings for the quarter or in the forecast. Thank you. Carlos Rodriguez : I think in this kind of environment, given the very first comments we made about the economy, and you have both the economy of the tailwind and you have now in the U.S. I think an administration that is kind of more inclined to regulation into, particularly employer regulation. And so you have, I think a very strong backdrop for what I would say is the foreseeable future. In that environment, historically, what ADP would do is we would add as much sales capacity as possible.  That doesn't mean that we indiscriminately hire because we have people to hire and onboard and train and so forth. And we have to make those people effective. But I would say that we have a strong appetite for growing our sales force, but also for growing our investment in marketing. Whether it's digital marketing or more traditional advertising. And that's exactly what we plan to do. Having said that, I would tell you that we've had challenges like everyone else, in terms of hiring, it's a very difficult labor market.  So I hope that we can fulfill those expectations, those dreams, if you will, of growing our sales force as fast as possible. But that's the only thing that I could see getting in the way. We obviously have the capital, we have the I think the desire and we have, I think the experience to be able to execute once we hire those people to get the sales, get the clients implemented, and then hopefully derive the benefits of that revenue for, in many cases 15-20 years, depending on which business unit you're in. And so I guess I would say strong appetite for both headcount growth, but also other investments in sales. Whether it's marketing, digital marketing, sales tools, all across-the-board. Jason Kupferberg : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Tien-jian Huang with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Tien Jian Huang : Thanks so much. Good results here. Just on the PEO side, I'm curious how much of the general improvement there is secular versus cyclical? And I know Carlos, you talked about putting more sales energy there as well. Just curious, what's changed? Carlos Rodriguez : So the risk of -- because we had a strong feeling that the PEO business was going to be strong coming out of the pandemic. Because it's been strong coming out of prior economical recession. and those are the different recession. So I have to be careful about any specific predictions. But we had some challenges, I think coming out of the pandemic with the price that we're selling in the PEO were slightly smaller and just ballpark it around 10% smaller. So let's say that the average, I'm just going to make up the numbers. Let's say the average new clients over in the PEO with 3 worksite employees and all of a sudden, prior to the pandemic and that's been can quote, growing slightly over the years. All of a sudden it came down to like 27, so 10% decline. So even if you sell 10% more units, if the units are at 10% smaller, you basically end up in the same place. So that's a little bit of what we were expecting. We believe that a 100% related to the economy, and to what was happening with the pandemic. Now what we've seen in the recovery is both the unit growth is still strong as it was prior year, and now our unit size has recovered. And so the combination of those 2 things has created really, really strong growth in the first quarter in the PEO.  The only caveat that I would add also is that we did have a transition into a new year, as you know, our fiscal year ended on June 30th. And in some cases, our businesses tend to perform really extremely well in the first quarter when they come out of a year where -- I wouldn't call it under-performance because it was still a good year last year, given the circumstances. But clearly the PEO, we were very, I think, clear that the PEO had been trailing, in terms of recovery when it comes to bookings, what we were seeing in EF. Now, as we expected, the horse race now -- the horse in the lead has changed. So now the PEO is the one leading the race. Tien Jian Huang : Thank you, Carlos. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thank you and congrats on the results and Don Welcome. Hey, I wondered -- could you give us a sense, Carlos, from a sales perspective, despite the tight environment you're still delivering, is there any way to think about the go-to-market strategy this cycle as opposed to last that and how maybe technology and maybe more of a mix down-market helps drive that process. I guess what I'm saying is there more leverage in the sales force today than you've ever had, is there any way to maybe put some parameters around that? Carlos Rodriguez : I think there is definitely more leverage in the sales force than we've ever had because -- I mean, I think maybe what you're alluding to our sales force like a lot of other of our competitors had to go to a 100% virtual for a number of months, and I'm sure every competitor handled differently in terms of how long they were virtual, versus when they went back in the field. But that process which we had been learning about for 20-25 years, like we have almost a third of our sales force already selling what we call insights sales. And so they were able to sell virtually. They had been in a building, but it didn't really matter whether they want the building or in their homes. They were still able to sell very effectively. That was an easy transition for that portion of our sales force, and then we really with the appropriate tools and some training and some learning from our inside sales force we really moved our entire sales force to sell virtually. So I think now we're really in a period where we're going to sell based on, however the client wants to be sold. And so if the client wants a combination of an initial video call on Zoom or WebEx, we'll do that. If the client once an in-person visits we'll do that if they want to close the deal with an in-person, but start with a video, we can do that. So I think there's no question that if Salesforce leverage has increased for us, but admittedly, probably for our competitors as well. Our reach has definitely been extended. There's no question about that in terms of tools, but also philosophically. I think we are now, I think able to sell in a, I mean to use a cliche and omnichannel way. We're also investing heavily in digital marketing. So you mentioned the down-market, I would just add that because of some of the comparisons to the down-market had that was not withdraw the sales results this quarter. It was actually all the other businesses. So but we do see the underlying strength in small business. But because of the difficult comparison, it's not reflected in the percentages. So not trying to minimize the strength in the momentum in the down-market, I'm trying to emphasize the strength everywhere else in the portfolio. And the rest of the portfolio also can benefit from digital tools, digital marketing, but it's not quite as leveraged as it is in the down market. So I think it's a combination of a lot of different things, but the overall, I think comment would be there's no question that there is increased leverage in the Salesforce and you're seeing it in terms of the productivity numbers. I mean it, we are frankly very positively surprised by the rebound in what we call average sales force productivity. So the actual sales rep level, how much are they selling today versus what were they selling in Fiscal year '19. And that is back to, and above that level, which is very pleasing to us. Kevin McVeigh : That's helpful. And then just one real quick one on retention. What was the boost kind of all the Q1 over-performance because I know the Q2 December's big quarter in terms of retention, things like that or is it just more optimism over the balance of the year or a little of both? Is there any way to frame how much of that boost was maybe Q1 over-performance as opposed to how you're feeling over the balance of the year? Don Mcguire : Maybe I will take that. I think our retention, certainly we're very happy with the Q1 record we have, but I think it's also heavily linked to the success we've had over the last few years with our improvements in NPS. And as our NPS continues to go on the right direction and improved, we're seeing general increases in retention to go along with that, I think that's what we would expect and that's what we want to see happen.  So I think there is some relationship there. The -- with no doubt that the retention is very good and we're benefiting still I think from a little bit of some of the concerns coming out of the pandemic that clients may have about switching it during a time of still virtual for many. So we're benefiting from that as well and we acknowledge that. But as I said, we're very happy with the retention and the progress we're making with our products and our service that go along to driving those retention numbers. We will see a little bit of a step back perhaps in the down-market. But as we said so far, it's soft living up better than we expected. Danyal Hussain : And just to clarify, because we did share in our prepared remarks that the raise which primarily a function of the Q1 results, obviously we have the stability in October as well. Kevin McVeigh : That makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open. Ramsey El Assal : Hi, Gentlemen. Thanks for taking my call this morning. I wanted to ask about margins and forgive me if you addressed this in some detail, I missed a bit of the call earlier, but it came in really strongest quarter well above our model, can you speak to the drivers of the beat and also to their sustainability as we move forward. Carlos Rodriguez : Sure, let me start by saying that the margin in the first quarter was a record for us. And it was above last year as we just reported But if you go back to last year -- last year was above the prior year. It's quite impressive that we had margin improvement last year, given that we were one quarter into a pandemic. But it's even more impressive is that impressive that we had margin improvement again, having said that, up the victory lap.  Then the other part of the comment is we had way higher revenue than we had anticipated, which is incredibly gratifying We're very happy about that, and it was really in both ES and PEO. And it was an a bunch of different places. Slightly better pace per control, retention was better. You heard all the comments. We have just a lot of things working in our favor here. The expenses have not caught up to the revenues and so right now, we are trying to add capacity, both for implementation and service, particularly ahead of our year-end period. And so like other companies, the most important thing for us is to be able to execute on our commitments to our clients, and to be able to start a business that we've sold. And so I would say that that's a dynamic that factored into the margin performance, but I don't want to take anything away from the organization or anything away from the operating leverage because it's pretty impressive what the organization was able to accomplish. But had we known where we were going to be in terms of top line and volumes, we would have more headcount today than we have. And there is some catching up to do.  Now to put a fine point on that, don't think of, we have to add hundreds of millions dollars with expense, we're just a little bit behind, and that's why you see in case someone's asked it yet may as well address it head on for the rest of the year. When you look at the EPS and the guidance, we really not raising by much more than what we had in terms of our performance in Q1. And that's because we are going to continue to invest in both sales and distribution, but also in service and implementation.  And that delay in hiring or deferred hiring helped us in terms of the margin in the first quarter, I strongly believe we still would've had a very strong margin performance in the first quarter, even had we hit our headcount numbers for service implementation and volume-related businesses. And I thought I should kind of put that out there because it seems like an obvious question as well. Ramsey El Assal : That's great and I appreciate your candor there. Quick follow-up from me. I was wondering about the human resources and human capital management products. Can you talk about how the cross-selling process into your basic kit of kind of payroll customers is organized? I'm just trying to figure out sort of how you go about that cross-sell process. And I guess how much of a runway do you see for attach rates to those products? Carlos Rodriguez : There really isn't a simple answer to that, to the first part. We'll come back to the -- I think the second question about the attach rates. Let me answer that one first. The attach rates are -- there's a couple of products where we have what I would call good attach rates, acceptable, which is saying as CEO speak for, they could always be higher. Like our benefit admin tools, our time and attendance systems. But most of our products and our worker's compensation tool in a down-market also has a high attach rate. But almost everything else that is quote, unquote, beyond payroll. So HCM in addition to kind of our core payroll solutions, we're way under penetrated in terms of attach rates.  So there is a lot of potential, I think for that to improve as well. So on the first part of your question in terms of how we cross-sell, as I started saying, there isn't a simple answer because there isn't a simple answer. In some of our businesses, we have very distinct organizations like in the down-market, we have a large down-market sales force that works with accountants and other kind of third-party channels and also sell directly. And then we have a sales force that sells our retirement solutions are 401K products. And our insurance services solution, those are distinct sales forces that basically share leaves with each other, and they have incentives to do so. That down-market business also feeds business to our PEO through also incentives. But there is a separate and distinct sales force in the PEO as well. When you get into the up-market and into the mid-market, you start to get some portion of our sales force which is able to sell multiple products or whatever call bundles.  But even then, you still have specialized sales forces in certain circumstances, depending on, I think the specialization or the complexity of the product. But in all cases, we have primary sales. What I would call primary sales people. So the quarterback, if you will, on an account. Now I'm talking about upmarket and mid-market and those quarterbacks are really in charge of making sure that when it's appropriate, and when a client has a need that we bring in our specialized sales people that have specific knowledge about some of our other HCM solutions.  So I wish I could give you a simple answer, but that's actually part of the secret sauce, right? In terms of our ability to grow and outperform some of our competitors is to be able to do that well. And I'd like to say that I invented this, but this is something that goes all the way back to the Frank Wattenberg days and to my predecessors . And this is a well - oiled machine in terms of our sales and distribution. And specifically, you've just described about the cross-sell. And again, to put a fine point on it roughly 50 percent of our bookings come from cross-sell and roughly 50 percent of our bookings come from new logos each year. Ramsey El Assal : Very helpful. Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Kartik Mehta : Carlos, I just wanted to get your thoughts. I know you talk to obviously a lot about new sales and I'm wondering, outside of this wage inflation that you're seeing. Is the cost to acquire clients going down, especially on the SMB side now that there is a new way to sell to them? Or do you think the cost to acquire clients as we move through this pandemic will go back to what it was? Carlos Rodriguez : I wish I had a crystal ball in terms of answering where it's going to go. But I think just from a mathematical or technical standpoint, the cost of sale is definitely pulling down because of this productivity increase. So this is the same leverage that you're seeing in so many industries and so many businesses, including ours, on the revenue happens on the bookings as well. When you get higher volumes it basically indicates higher -- unless you add a lot of expense, by definition you get higher productivity. So you see us being reported in the press all the time about, how worker productivity is up. Well, hardly reason why worker productivity is up is because revenues of recovered, volumes have recovered, and it sustained people. Or you're adding a few more people now. Maybe people aren't focusing on, is that worker productivity went down, right as the pandemic kind of set in and people's revenues went down. So I hate to make it so simplistic, mathematically. But some of that is what's happening now.  So you do have to be careful about jumping to any medium to long-term conclusions because right now our cost of sale compared to last year and the year before is definitely coming down as a result of a very large increase in bookings with how a similar increase in expenses. We still though are not back to where our cost of sale was pre -pandemic. And we hope to get there. But that will require even a little bit more productivity during this year. But that would be our expectation is that whether it's the GDP or interest rates or employment, that, there's regression to the mean here as they very large economy. ADP's large Company, but the economy is massive, and it tends to regress to the mean on a lot of things, and we also tend to regress to the mean s. So I think some of these things will work themselves out. And you have to just get past the base effects, and the comparisons, and so forth to really understand where you are, and we won't know that until we're on the other side unfortunately, I hate to say it. Kartik Mehta : Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. James Faucette : Thank you very much and thanks for all the  this morning. I guess maybe I just want to ask the obvious headline question and just wondering how the reported current tightness in the labor market, as factored into your guidance? And how are you anticipating on that changes through the coming fiscal year? And I guess maybe a product and service-related question tied to that. Are you seeing incremental sales opportunities with some of the tech that you can provide to your clients for hiring, etc. and is that having any impact on how you're thinking about your outlook and forecasts? Thanks. Carlos Rodriguez : Thanks for the question. The second part of your question, I think kind of answers the first part. The answer is yes. Like, I think part -- again, hard to separate how much is just pure GDP growth, new business formation etc. But the last part of your question, there's no question that part of our growth is driven by what you are alluding to, which is everyone now is looking for help in terms of hiring, attracting people, and frankly, also trying to hold onto them. This is a great environment for us. The combination of strong GDP, an administration that is more inclined towards regulation, and then a tight labor market for people who do the things that we do. By that I mean, payroll staff and HR staff at prospects and our clients. That's all a very good backdrop for us. I'm assuming that -- this is not going to resolve itself overnight in terms of the tightness in the labor market. We should anticipate some tailwinds here and some help for some period of time, until that changes. And I hate to use the R word, but some day, at some point in the future, doesn't see m anywhere near future given what's going on with government stimulus and government policy. But someday that might change. But we don't see that on the horizon right now. On the very first part of your question though in terms of the tight labor markets, I would say the overwhelming impact of tight labor markets is positive on AEP. I mentioned one of the challenges we have, which is tight labor market affects our own internal associates in terms of we have to hire service people and implementation people, so it's harder for us like it is harder for anyone else. But that pale in comparison to the upside, like a tight labor market drive new bookings as we just talked about in the last part of your question. But it also could create inflationary pressures, which drives our balanced growth. It should drive interest rates higher, which is one of the most underappreciated stories, I think of ADP is the potential upside in our flow business.  And the reason it's underestimated because it's done nothing for 10 years because they've been here for 10 years and has been nothing for pain and headwind. And just what I thought we were coming out of it, we go into a pandemic, and we get more pain, and race go even lower than they were before. But I'm pretty sure that it those changes any lower now. Although, I think we may have to file an AK after saying that. I'm making a statement on interest rates. But, whatever. Hover around here, go down a little bit there, but it feels pretty certain that the long-term, medium and long-term trend now for interest rates will be at least for gradual increases.  And I'm not suggesting that there's still underlying demographics that may keep us from getting back to the same kind of 10-year rate that we had 15 years ago or ten years ago. But I think everyone knows when you look at real interest rates that there is upside on interest rate. So the tight labor market helps in a number of ways. It creates activity for our sales force. Every time there's activity and there's conversations, we're going to win our fair share. So that's a great backdrop.  It creates opportunities for our balances. I think it creates opportunities for the PEO because some of our billings are actually driven by as a percentage of wages. And whenever you have wage inflation, if you are building on percent of wages, to some extent that will help, that's not So, like an infinite thing because we won't just allow our revenue to go up indefinitely. We'd have to adjust those rates but in the medium-term, we will see, I think, some tailwind from -- in the PEO from higher wages and wage growth, which is inevitable outcome of a tight labor market. James Faucette : That's great color. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Your line is open. Bryan Bergin : Hi, good morning. Thank you. I had to follow-up first on retention. Curious, within the record, 1Q retention performance, can you dig in a little bit more as far as the drivers there between the still lower out of business closures versus essentially better competitive win rates, And anything broadly, you can comment on around -- around clients switching behavior or client re engagement to assess HCM solutions? Carlos Rodriguez : On the first -- on the first part, I'm not sure how much more color we can give you. We have a fair amount of detail in terms of losses and retention around, we call non-controlled the losses which are broadly speaking out of business, bankruptcies, etc. And those have started to trend back up again. They're not back to normal levels, but they started to trend back. I think that's not surprising because there's still a lot of liquidity, and a lot of stimulus if you will, even if it's not new stimulus. So when you have consumer spending doing what it's doing, and you have activity doing what it's doing. It tends to be supportive of small business rather than the normal turnover that you have that's natural in the small business sector.  I guess with hindsight, like if 3 or 6 months ago, when we were putting together our plan, we'd had a crystal ball, we would've probably -- and we had experienced with the pandemic, we probably would have planned the downturn in retention to be slower. So we've been positively surprised by how long it's taking for those losses to regress back to normal. Having said that, we don't know that they're going to regress 100 % backs  because there's other parts of our retention that are controllable. We call controllable. In our controllable losses, we see those going down as well.  And I think Don made a common thing that should not be lost on you, which is that our client satisfaction scores as measured by NPS, are the highest they've ever been. And I give credit to the organization for during the pandemic, being able to get through what was an incredibly difficult time for them personally, in terms of they were trying to help our clients. But we also had a huge increase in volume because of all the government stimulus programs in the PPP loans, etc. And this happened all over the world, it wasn't just in the U.S.. And fortunately, we maintained relative stability in our headcount.  We didn't do mass layoffs and let a bunch of people go. So the combination of maintaining investment and also being able to, to have people -- I don't know how to described it. Make a efforts to help our clients, we were able to maintain those NPS where that actually haven't go up. And there's staying at very strong levels, and we believe that there is a correlation between strong NPS and retention. So we may be able to see new record highs for retention on a permanent basis, but it's way too early to make that prediction. Bryan Bergin : Okay. And then just follow-up on, on next-gen HCM platform. Can you provide an update on new sales there? Maybe the pipeline and sold clients versus lifelines, any metrics or updates you're willing to share? Carlos Rodriguez : Sure. I think we talked about over the last couple of quarters as we kind of entered in the pandemic, we obviously had a couple of particularly large clients that we're in industries that were particularly hard hit. So we've got put on a little bit off course, if you will, in terms of our implementations and our starts. We also, I think, started to focus on implementation tools. I think we had -- I don't know how many set -- how many we said we had sold. And as we started implementing in starting these clients. We recognize that we still have some work to do in terms of implementation tools and making sure that if and when we want to use third-party integrators to help us with that, that we need to build out those tools.  There has been quite a lot of focus on that effort. And we feel good about it. We actually -- I think we also talked about investments in the last quarter that we made to bring in some third-parties to help us with the evaluation. And in some cases, the build of that to make sure that as we now enter a hopefully a period of time where we can really accelerate the implementations and the growth and the starts of those clients. But it's fair to say, and I think we said in the last couple of quarters that our focused turn ed more to, making sure that we have a strong foundation and that we had the right implementation tools to be able to get the business started that we intend to have in the next year or 2, which is hopefully quite -- quite a lot of business. And you'll hear more details about this when we get to our Investor Day on November 15th. Bryan Bergin : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Eugene Simuni with Moffett Nathanson. Your line is open. Eugene Simuni : Hi, thank you very much for taking my questions. I have badge the couple in the PEO, so I'm asking upfront. One is that, if you look broadly at your HRO offerings, so PEO and non-PEO, can you compare and contrast for us a little bit to the PEO Solutions and non-PEO hopefully outsourced solutions, how are you seeing them growing relative to each other the demand? And are you seeing any switch in between clients who might be using that HRO Solutions without benefits switching into the PEO? So that will be the first one and the second, I was just curious. How are you positioning the be-all franchise to really win market share in a post-pandemic environment, given the secular growth seems to be very favorable. But how do you actually make sure that ADP wins share? Carlos Rodriguez : So on the first -- on the first question, I think I said in my early comments that all of the HRO Solutions, the Corporal Outsourcing Solutions, are very, very strong across-the-board, right? Up-market because we have HRO Solutions in the up-market, we have in the mid-market, and we have them in the down-market. And in in the down market -- and in the mid-market, we have PEO, but we also have what you're alluding to, which is a non-core employment. What I would call -- we call it comprehensive services, as the name implies, it provides a kind of broader assortment of services in addition to our traditional software in our traditional tax and other services.  There is to my knowledge a lot of switching from clients that are, what I would call typical clients of ADP that have payroll benefits and I'd then maybe TLM, etc., whether it's in a down-market in the mid-market into these HRO Solutions, there is not a lot to my knowledge of switching across because it typically. Again, if we're doing our job from a sales standpoint, you are really trying to find the right fit for the client. In some cases, the client wants you to do their benefits admin, and provide their benefits, provide the workers comp, and their 401-K.  In other cases, the client wants you to only do the administrative back-office of the payroll department in the HR department which would be the non - PEO solutions. So I think if we do our job well, which I think we do in the sales process, and in the upgrade process, those clients tend to stay on those -- on whatever solution they have chosen. But to be clear, both of them are growing at this point at rates that are multiples of our growth in employer services. And so it's quite impressive in terms of the tailwind and the growth rates that we have in all of the HRO businesses. On the last part of your question, which I think was about positioning PEO in terms of market share and so forth. We have 600 and I think it's 630,000 roughly, we reported worksite employees, average worksite employees this last quarter. That's tripled, what it was 10 years ago in the first quarter of fiscal year 11. And so and that's a higher market share than it was 10 years ago. So I don't know how else to answer that question other than to say that we have a proven track record of execution to continue to drive growth in the PEO that's faster than the markets. So I don't think there's any question about our positioning or our ability to drive market share as evidenced by our ability to execute. Eugene Simuni : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And our last question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open. Mark Marcon : Good morning, Carlos and Don, look forward to working with you. On next-gen payroll can you give us an update in terms of the roll out there, please? Carlos Rodriguez : So next-gen PEO, equally excited as we are about next-gen HCM in terms of what this holds for the future for ADP. The challenge for us in terms of as we communicate and on November 15th, we'll try to figure out a way to address this issue. Like, we have 15 billion in revenue. So as well as next-gen HCM are going and next-gen payroll is going, it just doesn't -- this is a future impact for ADP., so it's not in the next quarter. And I know you're not asking a question that's really about next quarter mark, but I think it was a good opportunity to kind of throw that out there.  That -- what's driving the performance of ADP this quarter, this year, and for the next 2 to 3 years is not going to be that from a financial standpoint. But in terms of positioning the Company for the future, in terms of growth and creating competitive differentiation and the ability to drive new bookings, they're absolutely critical. So I would say that on those measurements we're still happy and excited by the progress we're seeing with both next-gen HCM, as well as next-gen payroll, we have not gone to general availability, so we're selling a lot of next-gen payroll, but we're only selling in what we call the core of major accounts right now of the mid-market, which is kind of 50 to 150 and this is no different in terms of the playbook that we use with our transition from our old platform to run in a down-market.  And some of our more legacy platform in mid-market to then our next-gen Workforce Now version which we're on now. So we're doing the same thing with next-gen payroll and the same thing with next-gen HCM, which is we're doing very carefully that we have a very large installed base. And we are not -- We're going to eventually move some of those clients, and begin to move some of those clients. But we're happy with the business and the cash flow that we have, and the clients satisfaction scores that are record levels on our existing platform.  So we do not have any -- this is not panicking. There's no sense of crisis, and there's no -- we have urgency, but no crisis, because I want to make sure people hear that. Like, I don't want you to think that we all have a sense of urgency because the faster we get these two solutions to scale, the faster we beat the competition. Mark Marcon : I appreciate that, and thanks for the color there. On the PEO growth, can you talk a little bit about two different dimensions? 1 would be, the growth that you're seeing kind of in the established states relative to some of the less mature states and to what extent are you seeing less mature states really catch on? Particularly given the -- the legislative and regulatory backdrop. And then secondly, how should we think about just health insurance costs now that elective surgeries are starting to come back, elective procedures are starting to come back. What impact would that end up having just on the overall pricing? I know that you're not necessarily impacted directly from a margin perspective, but just thinking about the demand environment. Carlos Rodriguez : It's a great question. I think the second part of question, so hopefully you'll forget about first part because we don't have -- we try to prepare for everything and that one, we'll have to follow-up with you on in terms of what regions or what states, we're strongest in terms of our sales. I'm going to suspect that they were all strong because honestly, like the PEO results were off the charts, there can't be any state that wasn't in strong double-digit growth. But we'll follow up on that question. On the healthcare rate question, you're right that we're not directly impacted, but you're also right to imply that we're indirectly impacted because it does matter, right? It matters to our clients what they're paying for healthcare. And I hate to be so simplistic, but I think what the actual regression to the mean and large economies -- the healthcare world and insurance companies are also similar in terms of they regress, right? So losses have an uncanny way of regressing to the mean. That's why I always caution people when all of a sudden someone thinks that they have this big decline in either workers comp costs or healthcare costs. It usually doesn't work that way. There's usually something that explains it and it usually regresses back to the mean.  I think, if I can try to answer -- what I think is the implication of your question, there was a temporary decline in things like elective surgery, and frankly, healthcare in general. People even start to stop going to their primary care physicians and so forth, that decreased healthcare costs temporarily. And I hate to use that word transitory, that is now the favorite word it seems talk about inflation, but it's very clear that that was transitory and that healthcare costs will come back.  And so I think to the extent you had below normal renewals, which would be our situation because we don't take risk on healthcare, so we wouldn't see it in our margins and in our cost structure. But to the extent that we had below normal renewals, we would expect those renewals to go back to normal because we would expect as healthcare costs go back to normal slowly, that those costs would have to be pass-through.  When you look at the healthcare insurance companies, as much criticism as they get, they are largely pass-through entities. They're paying hospitals, and providers, and other healthcare costs, prescription drugs, etc. And it's really not a business where you can say, we can't pass this 10 percent increase in healthcare costs because their margins are even 10 percent. And so that business is very straightforward, which is they try to earn a markup or margin for doing what they do in terms of managing networks etc. But in the end, they have to pass those costs through. We have to also, because we're a passive entity as well. And I think those who take risk on healthcare will probably see those costs go up over some period of time. Mark Marcon : Appreciate the comments. Look forward to seeing you on the 15th. Carlos Rodriguez : Same here. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I'm pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos Rodriguez : There's not much more I can say as we really had terrific results. I want to thank Don for joining and I think you're all going to be very happy to meet him and get the benefit of his experience in ADP more broadly, besides just in the finance organization. Because he has kind of real-world business experience within ADP as well. The -- I just want to end the way I usually end which is thanking our organization and particularly our front line associates because I'm not sure what's going on in other companies. but we would not be able to get our goals accomplished without people going above and beyond.  I think we mentioned the tight labor market and that we're a little bit behind in terms of our hiring, that means our people are working extra hard. An economist said, that an increase in productivity, I'd say that's just people working hard. And we really appreciate it, our clients appreciate it. I think our shareholders appreciate it, and I don't think a lot listen to this call, but you should be aware of that, whether it's here in other companies, there's a lot of people out there that are pushing really hard to deliver. And many of us, whether we're as consumers or buyers of products and businesses and so we're frustrated by what's happening in terms of supply chain and some of these other things. But all I see is a bunch of people working really, really hard to try to fulfill the needs of our clients. And I think that's happening across the whole economy. And I think we'd show a little bit of patience with each other.  Because this will all normalize as these variant now recedes, I mean, you're seeing already and some of the mobility data, things will slowly get back to normal. People will come back into the labor force. And this great economy that we have will function, the way it's supposed to function. But in the meantime, I want to thank our associates for what they've done so far, whether it's this last quarter and what they're going to have to do to get through this year-end, which is going to be very challenging given the volumes we have and the capacity we have. So for that, I thank them, but I also thank all of you for listening and for being supporters of ADP. Thank you. Operator : And this concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Michelle and I\u2019ll be your conference Operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call.  I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question during this time, simply press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. To withdraw your question, press the pound key. Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Danyal Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Danyal Hussain : Thank you Michelle and welcome everyone to ADP\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. Participating today are Carlos Rodriguez, our CEO, and Don McGuire, our CFO. Also joining us for Q&A is Maria Black, President of ADP.  Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC\u2019s website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today\u2019s call.  During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures which we believe to be useful to investors and that excludes the impacts of certain items. A description of these items, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release. Today\u2019s call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. With that, let me turn it over to Carlos. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you Dany, and thank you everyone for joining our call.  We\u2019re pleased to have delivered strong second quarter results, including 9% revenue growth, 20 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion, and a 9% increase in adjusted diluted EPS, all ahead of our expectations. It remains a very dynamic and challenging business environment for our clients and prospects, but we believe the value of working with a trusted ACM partner with more than seven years of expertise is more compelling than ever, and we see evidence of this reflected in our continued sales momentum as well as our very high levels of client satisfaction and retention, which continue to drive upside to our results. As usual, let me start with some highlights from the quarter. Our employers services new business booking results were strong despite the onset of the omicron variant at the end of the quarter. We experienced a record Q2 booking level and like Q1, we were pleased to be ahead of pre-pandemic sales productivity levels. We experienced robust double-digit growth in nearly every one of our ES businesses, and as we saw earlier in the year, we experienced every stronger performance in our PEO segment, where demand is especially robust. As we outlined at our November investor day, the pandemic and the dynamic macroeconomic environment have made running HR more challenging for our clients. Today our clients navigate a tight labor market across their organizations, higher than usual worker turnover, new legislative requirements, and in many cases staffing challenges specifically within their payroll and HR departments. The strong broad-based demand across our ES and PEO segments reflect the fact that clients of all sizes are increasingly looking for greater levels of assistance and expertise to help address their needs, in some cases seeking our intuitive yet comprehensive software offerings while in other cases seeking a more fully outsourced solution. We believe we provide extraordinary value through all business environments, and today\u2019s environment supports a continuation of a positive decades-long secular trend in global HCM. Moving onto employer services retention, we are pleased to have experienced continued strength. Although our retention in the quarter did decline very slightly versus last year\u2019s elevated level, it declined by less than we had anticipated and would have represented a record Q2 if you were to exclude last year\u2019s pandemic impacted retention levels. With overall client satisfaction once again reaching a record level this quarter, this strong retention is not surprising to us. Moreover, early January results look strong, giving us greater confidence for the rest of the year, and we are pleased to be raising our retention guidance once again. Our ES pays per control metric came in slightly better than expected at 6% growth in the quarter. We are very pleased to see the U.S. unemployment rate back below 4%, which reflects the U.S. economy\u2019s ongoing improvement and resulting strong demand for workers. Meanwhile, labor force participation is gradually recovering and as it does, we should continue to benefit from higher than usual pays per control growth. Over the first half of the fiscal year, we\u2019ve tracked ahead of our expectations and are now raising our pays per control outlook for the full year.  In the second quarter, our PEO had stellar performance once again and was well ahead of our expectations with 15% revenue growth and 16% average worksite employee growth, representing acceleration from last quarter despite a slightly harder growth comparison. Across the board strength in our PEO continues to be driven by several factors, including better than expected retention and bookings contributing to client growth, better than expected hiring within the PEO client base, further adding to worksite employee growth, and better than expected wage levels further adding to revenue growth. While some of these tailwinds will normalize over time, we remain very confident in the outlook of our PEO business over the coming years. During our November investor day, we also outlined key aspects of our growth strategy by product and by business unit, and we are confident about sustaining healthy growth in our fast-growing businesses and optimistic about accelerating our growth in our businesses that continue to transition to our most modern offerings. One aspect of our growth strategy that we discussed is an overall greater focus on marketing, which we believe will allow us to better activate our existing scale distribution. We believe at ADP, we can deliver a lot of incremental value from tactical investments, and we look forward to sharing more in the very near future. One key product initiative we talked about during investor day that cuts across our businesses is the development of a new unified user experience, and in the second quarter we were pleased to have made further progress on this effort. As a reminder, we shared last quarter that we moved our Run client base over to the new ADP UX, and now only a quarter in, early indicators suggest that clients are in fact finding it more intuitive, resulting in fewer client service contacts. In Europe, we have been gradually transitioning our client base over to our award-winning IHCM platform, and in Q2 we seamlessly moved those clients over to the new ADP UX. We\u2019re now very excited that just this month, we began our pilot of the new ADP user experience for Workforce Now, which when coupled with our next gen payroll engine makes for an even more differentiated offering for what is already a market-leading HCM solution in this target market. In terms of a few other highlights, I\u2019m pleased to share that we reached a new milestone by running 1 million pay slips for a single client on a single day for the first time. At the other end of the spectrum, our Roll mobile app, which serves the micro segment, continues to outperform our initial expectations. In another milestone in calendar 2021, the ADP mobile app had over 1 billion log-ins, highlighting the growing amount of direct engagement we have with employees and managers around the world. To that point, this month our return to workplace mobile solution, part of the ADP mobile app, was awarded the Business Intelligence Group\u2019s 2022 Big Innovation Award. As a final highlight, just this week we launched our bill pay feature in the Wisely app. Bill pay is free to Wisely users and fully integrated into the app, and has been a top requested feature from our user base. We believe this addition will further drive engagement and retention, and we look forward to continuing to expand the Wisely ecosystem. Overall, Q2 represented a solid outcome on both the financial front as well as with respect to key strategic initiatives. I\u2019d like to thank our associates who continue to deliver these exceptional products and outstanding service to our clients, and I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Don. Don McGuire : Thank you Carlos, and good morning everyone.  In the second quarter, we delivered 9% revenue growth on both a reported and organic constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBIT margin was up 20 basis points, better than planned, and supported by our better than expected revenue growth, offset partially by increased PEO pass-throughs and headcount growth in our implementation and service organizations. I\u2019ll share more on this last point when I discuss our outlook. Our tax rate was up slightly in the quarter versus last year, driven by the lapping of a one-time international tax benefit we experienced last year. When including the benefit from share repurchases, we had a 9% increase in our adjusted diluted earnings per share.  Moving onto the segments, our employer services revenue increased 6% on a reported basis and 7% on an organic constant currency basis. In addition to the strong bookings, retention trends, and pays per control performance Carlos outlined, our client funds interest grew for the first time since the pandemic started as lower average yield was offset by a tremendous 28% balance growth. This growth included some benefit from the lapping of last year\u2019s deferred employer social security taxes and incremental benefit from the repayment of a portion of those employers\u2019 social security taxes, which together contributed several points of growth in addition to the already robust growth from higher client count, employment growth, and higher wages. Our ES margin increased 40 basis points, ahead of our expectations for the quarter and supported by better than expected revenue performance.  Moving on, our PEO continued to deliver exceptional performance with 15% revenue growth in the quarter. Average worksite employees accelerated to 16% year-over-year growth and reached 660,000 for the quarter. Key contributors were strong bookings and retention, as well as very healthy pays per control growth within the PEO client base. Revenues excluding zero-margin pass-throughs grew 18%, which was driven by worksite employee growth as well as higher average wages and higher SUI revenues per worksite employee. PEO margin was down 10 basis points in the quarter. Included in that figure was pressure from workers\u2019 comp and SUI expenses due primarily to worker mix and wages.  Moving on to our updated outlook for the year, for ES revenues we are narrowing our guidance and now expect growth of about 6%, the upper end of our previous guidance range of 5% to 6%. The primary drivers for our higher outlook are the stronger Q2 performance, our higher client funds interest outlook for the year, and higher pays per control growth, partially offset by an expectation from incremental FX headwind in the back half of this year on the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. For our client funds interest revenue, we\u2019re raising our outlook by $20 million to a range of $440 million to $450 million. Like last quarter, we\u2019re raising our balance growth assumption meaningfully to now expect growth of 18% to 20%, whereas our client funds yield expectation is unchanged despite the improvement in interest rates. This is primarily because our stronger than previously expected balance performance creates a temporary lag with greater short term investments before we purchase higher yielding fixed rate securities. For U.S. pays per control, we\u2019re raising our outlook by 1% to now expect 5% to 6% growth. We continue to expect that a gradual ongoing recovery in labor force participation will support job growth, and the first half of the year was a bit ahead of expectations.  In addition to client funds and pays per control, we are raising our retention guidance slightly and now expect it to be down 40 basis points for the year. Although we still anticipate some normalization in client switching activity, trends so far this year have been very positive, and January is looking like a continuation of that same strength. One thing we\u2019re not changing at this time is our ES booking guidance. As Carlos outlined, our Q2 performance was strong, but bookings is one place where the evolving pandemic conditions and the omicron variant has potential to create noise, as we saw at the outset of the pandemic. Although we haven\u2019t seen a material impact at this time, we still think it\u2019s prudent to maintain a wide range of outcomes in our guidance. For our ES margin, we are making no change to our outlook of up 75 to 100 basis points. Although we are raising our revenue guidance and although some of that is coming from high margin revenues, like client funds interest and pays per control, at the same time we are now more fully caught up on implementation and service headcount after running a bit behind earlier this year and late last year. This investment in implementation and service teams is critical both because the current year-end period is important to our clients and their employees, and also as we look to get ahead of the needs of our growing client base. With the continued outperformance in retention, we\u2019re now planning to grow our implementation and service teams slightly more than we had previously planned as we exit this fiscal year. In addition to this growth in personnel, we also took one-time compensation actions across our organization in recognition of broader inflation trends in the market. The incremental expenses associated with those actions are now included in our outlook. Although this tight labor market has created its own set of challenges for most companies, we are very pleased to have been able to grow our organization as much as we did these past few months, and the wage increases we layered in give us confidence regarding our staffing levels at a busy time of year. We are also pleased to have been able to support those changes without detriment to our existing guidance ranges. Moving onto the PEO, following the strong first half trends in both client growth and worksite employee growth, we are now expecting average worksite employees to grow 13% to 15%, and we are likewise raising our guidance for PEO revenues and revenues excluding zero-margin pass-throughs by two percentage points each. Our outlook will continue to be sensitive to employment trends within our PEO client base, as well as bookings and retention performance, so although we are currently contemplating growth to be a bit lower in the back half of the year, we could continue to see upside if the current robust trends persist. For PEO margin, we are making no change to our guidance of flat to down 50 basis points for the year. Although we are raising our revenue guidance, we are at the same time expecting higher SUI and workers\u2019 comp expenses to create offsetting margin pressure. Putting it all together for our consolidated outlook, we now expect revenue to grow 8% to 9%. For adjusted EBIT margin, we continue to expect an increase of 50 to 75 basis points. As we shared earlier this year, we expect our margin improvement to be concentrated in the fourth quarter and expect our margin to be down in Q3, particularly following the recent personnel growth and wage increases. We\u2019re making no change to our tax rate assumption. With these changes, we now expect growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share of 12% to 14%.  Thank you, and I\u2019ll now turn it back to Michelle for Q&A. Operator :  Our first question comes from Bryan Keane with DB. Your line is open. Bryan Keane : Hi guys, congrats on the results.  Just wanted to ask on the impact of omicron, especially in December and January. Is there any noticeable impact in sales or retention, or anything that you\u2019d call out particularly from the rise that we\u2019ve seen from the virus and omicron? Carlos Rodriguez : I think you heard from our prepared comments that the answer was no, but when you think about the way the quarter works, the omicron really started to pick up in, I would say, middle to last December in terms of my recollection. It\u2019s really incredible how fast things have changed with this, because now we\u2019re back on the down slope in the northeast, it appears at least, in the U.S., so it\u2019s pretty fast moving. But I would say that our answer is no, we didn\u2019t see anything in the quarter that we just reported. Obviously we\u2019re now in the next quarter and it\u2019s kind of difficult to start talking about the next quarter, given we\u2019re only, I think, three weeks into it, but you\u2019ve seen probably multiple reports--I saw one this morning in the Journal about, I think it was the IMF or someone kind of lowering global growth and so forth, and some of it is obviously a result of omicron, there\u2019s probably other factors as well.  We do believe that we\u2019re not immune from these kinds of things that ripple through the economy, including omicron, but the truth is we haven\u2019t really seen a big impact yet. But if GDP growth--I think the GDP growth for the full calendar year, most people have kind of kept it in the same range, so I\u2019m guessing that people have lowered their first quarter - talking about calendar quarters now - GDP growth forecasts slightly and probably increased, because I think it\u2019s just a matter of pushing activity forward, because it does look like in a few weeks, things will start to, quote-unquote, normalize in at least a portion of the country, and then I think shortly thereafter economic activity should be robust again, as was, I think, predicted by a bunch of economists. So anyway, that\u2019s a long way of saying not really, not yet, but we\u2019re always careful to not assume that we are somehow insulated completely from what happens in the overall economy. If people are traveling a little bit less, for example our own associate population, we proactively asked--we were already back in the process of getting people back into our offices, and we went back in the other direction for about a month or two. That just lowers economic activity - people aren\u2019t driving as much, they\u2019re not going to lunch in a local area, etc., and those things have a ripple effect through the economy, but no signs of any major decrease in demand or economic activity from our numbers yet. Bryan Keane : Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Just as a follow-up, wanted to ask about the strength in the balance growth - I think it was up 22% last quarter, up 28% this quarter. I don\u2019t know if you guys look at how much inflation could be driving that number as well, and any other call-outs--I know you raised the guide there, but just surprised at the strength there. Don McGuire : Yes, we have had some growth. Certainly wages were a little bit of that, but also as we said in the prepared remarks, the big driver was the lapping from last year with the deferral, so certainly the deferrals represented a few points in the growth of those balances in the quarter, although even the deferrals were only for a few number of days towards the end of the month of December.  Certainly we look at those, but as we said, we do expect the balance growth to continue and we expect it to be firm based on the pays per control and the increase in number of people working for our clients. I think that\u2019s the biggest driver. Carlos Rodriguez : And just in terms of a refresher, by deferrals, I think Don said in his remarks, there\u2019s a social security tax deferral. Not everyone lives day to day like us, but it was a significant stimulus--part of the stimulus package, if you will, and those social security deferrals need to be repaid half--we just went through that, which is what helped us in terms of tailwind on balances, and the other half is next December 31. That\u2019s something maybe to pencil in which would provide some support to our balances next year as well. Bryan Keane : Okay, thanks for taking the questions. Operator : Our next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Togut : Thank you, good morning. Could you unpack demand trends, looking at Run, Workforce Now, and Vantage HCM in the quarter and what\u2019s embedded in your 12% to 16% ES bookings growth outlook?  As a follow-up, if you could comment on your recent announcement that you\u2019re expanding Workforce Now with international functionality, what sort of traction do you expect to see there? Thanks. Maria Black : Yes, good morning, this is Maria. Thanks for the question, David, happy to comment on both. With respect to the overall performance in the quarter, as was stated in the prepared remarks, we had strong double-digit growth that did really go across our scaled offerings, specifically in the down market. We saw the strength in our Run platform, we saw the strength in our retirement solutions, definitely experienced strength in the Workforce Now platform. I\u2019ll cover off on your second question as well as we get to the press release that we just issued. Additionally in the second quarter, we also saw strength in GlobalView, so very happy with our international contribution to the quarter, so that was really the strength across the double-digit growth that we saw in employer services. As it relates to the Workforce Now press release that I think we issued in the last couple days regarding the offer that now is on a global basis, the ability for our U.S.-based and Canadian-based companies to process payroll on the Workforce Now platform across multiple countries, in partnership with our Celergo offering. Very excited to have this offering, as you could imagine. Over the course of the last decade but certainly in the last couple years, the ability for mid-market customers to really be able to support international employees on their end is a growing demand, and we\u2019re pretty excited to be able to satisfy that demand with this new offer. David Togut : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Kevin McVeigh : Great, thanks so much. Carlos, I think you talked about improvement in retention against a still challenging environment overall. Can you maybe reconcile those comments a little bit because, all things equal, I would think tougher environment, maybe you have a little bit more pressure from a client perspective. Can you unpack that a little bit? Carlos Rodriguez : Yes, I think what we\u2019ve been saying for probably a few quarters now, it\u2019s really not--maybe the tougher environment isn\u2019t the right term. It\u2019s tougher comparisons, because our thesis was that we\u2019d gotten some tailwind from the pandemic--there were a lot of tailwinds in a lot of areas, but one of them was in retention. There\u2019s less clients switching, and on top of that, there was also lower bankruptcy rates in down market, where it\u2019s a significant portion of the turnover of our clients is, quote-unquote, out of business, so all the government stimulus and all the low switching, I think really elevated our retention. At the same time, our NPS scores and client satisfaction and all the feedback we\u2019re getting from clients was very, very strong, so frankly it\u2019s difficult to separate the two, so we planned for some moderation in our retention as a result of those tailwinds because those tailwinds are going to go away. I think they\u2019re economically driven, and we\u2019ve seen a little bit of that in our down market. I think we\u2019ve also kind of alluded to that, that despite our continuing strong retention, it\u2019s kind of generally playing out the way we expected, which is our down market SBS is a little--is down a little bit over the previous year, but other parts obviously are holding up well, if not improving, and the net of that is better than we expected and better than we had planned. The question is, are we going to be able to hold onto all of it? Our plan of course is to hold onto all of it, and that is why you saw in Don\u2019s comments that we\u2019re making sure we have the right levels of service, the right levels of implementation, because if we can achieve the forecast we have for retention for the year, which will be ahead of what our plan and our expectations were, that has a meaningful impact on our long term growth and value creation for the company. Kevin McVeigh : That\u2019s very helpful. Then I don\u2019t know if this would be Carlos or Don, but could you remind us the rate sensitivity, 25 basis points, what that means? Then I guess I was surprised to see the boost in the extended investment strategy, just given I thought there was a little bit more of a lag effect on that, so maybe just--because obviously it\u2019s been so long, we\u2019ve been in front of a rate cycle, but just the dynamics of client funds relative to extended investment. Don McGuire : Yes, why don\u2019t I start with the second question first on the rate environment and what that means for us. Generally speaking, as you know, when the fund balances increase rapidly, we have to invest in short term items or short term instruments until we have the opportunity to invest in longer term instruments, and as a result, we don\u2019t see as much pick-up as we would like to see. But I can certainly give you some sensitivity with respect to if we had a 25 basis point improvement in the rates in our short term investments only, that would translate into about $9 million of EBIT on a 12-month basis, so not hugely significant. On the other hand, if we saw that both in the short and the intermediate term, that 25 basis points over a 12-month period would translate into about $23 million of impact before taxes, so certainly that becomes meaningful. As we look to invest those funds longer term and as rates continue to go in what we\u2019d say--I guess what we\u2019d say is a better direction, I think we have some opportunity in the future; but at this point in time, we think that we\u2019re not going to see a huge amount of improvement in the client fund interest over the balance of the second half. What we have talked about is in the forecast today. Carlos Rodriguez : Kevin, could you clarify the question on the extended portion, where specifically you\u2019re focused there? Kevin McVeigh : I guess just the dynamics of the client funds interest revenue versus the extended investment strategy, what the timing difference is on those two in terms of when you\u2019d see it, because obviously you saw a little bit of benefit from extended investment in term of the outlook, not as much on the client fund side, but is there a timing element to the extended versus the client funds. Carlos Rodriguez : Well, if you\u2019re talking about balance growth, the extended strategy balance growth is actually tied more to the volatility of cash flows on a year-to-year basis, so it has to do with our forecast of what our low balance is going to be in the year versus our average balance, which is a little bit different from the client funds forecast.  Long term, yes, the extended balance would grow kind of in line with the client funds balance growth, but on a short term, year-to-year basis, there\u2019s a whole more noise. That is actually driving the difference more so than the lag effect. The lag effect that Don was referring to has more to do with the growth in the client funds balances. When the growth is particularly high, it\u2019s often hard for us to reinvest quickly given the number of opportunities there are in the market and so forth for the type of credit quality that we\u2019re seeking, but we within a couple quarters can catch up, so it\u2019s just a question of how quickly we can deploy those additional funds. I think the short answer is the net impact from our strategy, because there\u2019s also a re-classing issue in terms of how we do it, in terms of accounting and so forth, so I think the right way to look at it is really what\u2019s happening with yields, what\u2019s happening with--overall, what\u2019s happening with balance growth, and then what\u2019s the net impact of our strategy, of our client fund strategy. I think on that front, the short answer is it\u2019s looking pretty good. Just as an example, our Q1 re-investments were at about a 1% yield, so new purchases, and in Q2 they were 1.5%, so it\u2019s been--you see the same thing we\u2019ve seen. The moves in the two-years and the five-years are even more significant than the 10-years and so forth, so for us it\u2019s the--you know, when we talk long, our version of long is three, five, seven, not beyond that, just because of the way we invest our portfolio, and on that front, you could not have a better environment in terms of wage inflation, balance growth and increases in interest rates. I would say we\u2019re not ready to say anything yet about \u201923 and \u201924, but all this--there\u2019s a lot of talk about mechanics in the short term or whatnot, because I know a lot of people are focused on the short term, but we\u2019re more long term oriented and we could be in here for a multi-year tailwind finally from client funds interest in a meaningful way. Kevin McVeigh : You\u2019re going to have a high class margin problem, Carlos. Carlos Rodriguez : Yes, listen - I\u2019ve been waiting 10 years. I had hair when I started as CEO, and I remember telling the treasurer at the time, rates have to go up next year, and then next year I said rates have to go up next year, and here we are. But this time, dammit, I\u2019m right! Kevin McVeigh : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Tien- tsin Huang : Thanks so much guys, good morning. Really good results, better base control, looking at better retention, in-line bookings, raising balance growth, and all that good stuff. I think of all of these as positive forces for margin expansion, right, so you\u2019re keeping the margin the same, so is that just a function of the costs you discussed, or is that some conservatism as well? Just trying to better understand that. Carlos Rodriguez : Well if the question is about conservatism, I\u2019ll let Don handle it. Tien- tsin Huang : Thank you. Thank you Carlos. Don McGuire : Yes, so I think the answer is that we have got a pretty reasonable forecast in front of us, so I think we\u2019re not being terribly conservative. But I think what you should consider, though, is that we raised our revenue by $150 million from the prior--from the prior forecast, and we\u2019ve also raised our expenses by $115 million. If you start to break down those expenses, that $115 million of expense increase, you come pretty quickly to PEO pass-throughs - we had $48 million of that, so $48 million of that expense increase is really having a bit of a drag on our margins. Otherwise, I think our margins clearly would be better, but that\u2019s really what\u2019s preventing us, and that\u2019s the reason we haven\u2019t been able to do more on the margins. But I do think that all in, we\u2019ve done a really good job of baking things into our guidance and firming up the expectations we set. Tien- tsin Huang : No, for sure. It\u2019s very good. Carlos Rodriguez : Just one other thing, I think we should also add to your point in terms of tone, we want to make sure we\u2019re clear here that we\u2019re not insulated from the world. There is no question that there is pressure on costs, particularly around wages, and we are a technology services company so we have costs around R&D and so forth. We also have costs around the service side of our business, and you\u2019ve heard in the prepared comments that Don mentioned that we\u2019ve taken some actions that are what I\u2019d call mid-cycle, so not the typical annual wage increases, because we felt we needed to do something to make sure that we held onto our people and that we were attracting the right kinds of people, so we are doing some things. Now, the good news on the other side of that coin, which I\u2019m assuming will come up later as a question but may as well address it now, like some other industries but not every other industry, we do have a fair amount of, and the industry has shown, demonstrated historically and, I think, there are some recent signs from competitors that pricing is more elastic than in many industries. This is not a commodity business, and there\u2019s a fair amount of room. The problem is you have to exercise that room very carefully because you want to remain competitive, and on and on and on. You\u2019ve heard that story from us for many years too, that we really want to win in the market, we want higher retention rates, so we can\u2019t just go around willy-nilly passing through price increases, but the fact is we can and we will if it\u2019s driven by market forces and cost increases that are experienced across the board. We\u2019re confident that our competitors will do the same thing, and some of them already are. Tien- tsin Huang : You answered my follow-up on pricing. Thank you Carlos. Thank you Don. Operator : Our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is open. Samad Samana : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to maybe circle back to the PEO business and the strength there, it continues to perform really well. I was curious, can you remind us, when we think about the source of new bookings for PEO, how much of it is new to ADP for the first time versus conversions of potential existing customers in the SMB side of the base that you\u2019re up-selling over to PEO? How should we think about the source of new bookings? Carlos Rodriguez : I think it\u2019s been pretty consistent for a long time at around 50%, right? Maria Black : That\u2019s right. Carlos Rodriguez : It\u2019s about half, that we kind of mine our own. It\u2019s a combination of mining our own clients, but we also mine our own sales force. Our sales force is able to bring in obviously new clients straight onto the PEO, but we also have a very large installed base that, as you alluded to, we mine. I think it\u2019s 50/50, if I\u2019m not mistaken. It hasn\u2019t really changed that much over the years. Samad Samana : Great, that\u2019s helpful. Then as I think about the consolidation of the base onto one UI, there\u2019s clear user benefits to that, but how should we think about maybe--is there a tailwind to that on the gross margin side as more and more of the base is on a single UI from, I guess, a service or a maintenance standpoint in terms of spend going forward, and how should we think about that unfolding on the gross margin line? Carlos Rodriguez : I think that\u2019s a fair point - there\u2019s a lot of things that we do that are intended to really, quote-unquote, standardize and to be able to get leverage, and this is clearly one of those where--you know, ADP historically was a little bit more fragmented in terms of our R&D, and we\u2019ve been, starting with my predecessor, I think trying to become more unified, etc., and the user experience is one of those places where there was an obvious opportunity that I think will make us better competitively and allow us to invest our money more efficiently, and there clearly is some back end benefit to that from a margin standpoint. But I would say I\u2019d be--I don\u2019t think it would be true to say that that was the primary driver. There\u2019s got to be some residual help from a margin standpoint and from an efficiency standpoint, but this is really about winning, about having the best products and having the best face to the market in terms of our--the best skin, if you will, on each of our products. It makes a difference, as you know.  We get it, we\u2019re a technology company now, and it matters a lot the experience that our--and it\u2019s not just our clients. It used to be 20, 30 years ago, it was only the clients. Now the employees of our clients are obviously touching and interacting with our products, especially with the mobile app, and this user experience stuff matters a lot in terms of engagement. Samad Samana : Great, helpful. Congratulations on the solid results. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Your line is open. Bryan Bergin : Hi, good morning, thank you. First, I want to follow up on retention. Can you dig in a little bit more about the underlying drivers, so out of business closures versus competitive switching behaviors? When you think about the 40 basis point year-over-year decline you forecasted, how much is due to a pick-up in that closure rate versus competitive losses? Carlos Rodriguez : Almost all of it is in the down market and related to normalization of economic factors, like closure rates. I don\u2019t know that closure rate is the right word, but that\u2019s one of the--that\u2019s in that category, what we call--we track uncontrollable losses and controllable losses. Controllable losses would be around service and product, etc.; uncontrollable is the obvious, like bankruptcies, out of business, etc.  What happened during the pandemic, it wasn\u2019t just that bankruptcies went down. All the categories of uncontrollable losses went down, and there has been some normalization of that, not all the way back to pre-pandemic, but I would say that there\u2019s really nothing that you could read into the numbers to tell you anything other than we have fantastic service, solid NPS scores, but there is some normalization in categories, specifically more down market. Everywhere else, I think our retention rates are good to improving and solid, and in many cases better than prior years. We have less tolerance in those other businesses because they\u2019re not as economically sensitive, so we have less tolerance for the excuse that there\u2019s going to be normalization there, because we now have a taste of what\u2019s possible in retention in the mid-market and in international and in--although international has been strong all along and in the up-market, and we just want to maintain those retention levels. But it would be foolish in the down market to assume that there won\u2019t be some economic factors and normalization - that\u2019s what you see reflected in our forecast. Bryan Bergin : Okay, makes sense. Then just on the PEO strength, so the sequential increase in worksite employees was really notable here. Can you just dig in a little bit more? I heard better units, so better retention, better bookings, but does seem like there\u2019s been a release or a tipping point here around clients converting to this model. Can you just talk about that? Carlos Rodriguez : Yes, I think that--we\u2019re thrilled, just to be clear, but let me just give you a few, back to these comparisons in the pandemic and noise. Part of our headwind in the PEO sales, which by the way we\u2019re positive and we\u2019re good, but not as good as ES last year. I think we shared a little bit of color there that the average client size sold had come down a little bit, wages weren\u2019t growing that much, so all of those things have an impact more on the PEO than they do in ES, particularly in some of the ES units.  Those things have all turned in the other direction now, so the average size client is bigger in terms of clients sold, and that is meaningful, and then you have wage growth which flows through the PEO. It doesn\u2019t flow through ES because the billing is not as a percent of wages, whereas in the PEO it is, and so we do have a number of tailwinds that are also helping. But the most important thing, which is maybe what you\u2019re alluding to, is the average worksite employee growth, which kind of cuts through the inflation and the wage growth and all that, and that\u2019s also robust but that\u2019s getting assistance, like I just mentioned, from average size client being a little bit bigger in terms of new business bookings. Again, that\u2019s great news, but it\u2019s a little bit of a normalization because it\u2019s actually back now, so it went down from where it was pre-pandemic, and now it\u2019s back up about to where it was pre-pandemic, and hopefully, you know, you get 1% to 2% growth going forward, but right now it\u2019s more than just 1% to 2% growth. Bryan Bergin : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi there, thanks for taking my question today. I wanted to ask you about your HCM products and the cross-sell opportunity into your base of payroll customers, sort of an update in terms of where you are there and whether you could potentially accelerate that process. Maria Black : Yes, so happy to comment on our HCM products and how our sellers go to market to drive the combination of new business bookings between new logos as well as add-on business, our HCM products from an attached perspective. As you can imagine, a lot of the investments that we\u2019ve spoken about for several years in existing products, a lot of the investments that we\u2019re making into our existing platforms - we just talked about the new UF and the impact that\u2019s making in our down market and will continue to make, coupled with the investments that we\u2019re making into our next gen products, are all investments that are anchored in a belief that we can continue to expand the offerings to our existing clients as well as new clients. Excited about the execution on each one of these initiatives and the impact that it will make to our bookings and the mix of bookings between new logos and HCM products attached. Carlos Rodriguez : Our attach rates in general are pretty good, particularly in some categories like--we said this before, like our workforce management, we used to call it time and labor, those products tend to have high attach rates, and others have high attach rates, others have low attach rates. I think part of our opportunity for whatever the years to come is to not only sell new logos, which we\u2019re now obsessed about because we want to grow market share, but share of wallet is a huge opportunity for us. The fact is, we have very low-ish penetration still in many of our categories and many of our products. Ramsey El-Assal: Interesting, okay. Thank you for that. A follow-up for me is on M&A and balance sheet deployment here. Obviously a lot of the valuation multiples in the sector have pulled in quite a bit. I don\u2019t know if the environment has created a situation where maybe you had a shopping list, a dream shopping list that maybe now you can go after that you couldn\u2019t before. But maybe an update on whether--you know, on your capital allocation and specifically as it relates to M&A plans would be helpful. Don McGuire : Yes, I think that there\u2019s always things flowing across everybody\u2019s desk and evaluations being done of opportunities, etc. While it\u2019s true that the last few weeks haven\u2019t been kind to some companies, I don\u2019t we\u2019ve really changed our objectives, and our objective is to make sure that anything that we seriously consider and we pursue has to fit the portfolio, so whether it\u2019s--it just has to be either a geography extension of what we currently have or it has to be something that\u2019s filling a product niche, and so we\u2019re going to continue to work by those guidelines, if you will. If things become more affordable and something falls into those categories, certainly we\u2019ll take the opportunity to look more seriously or to look a bit harder than we might have, say, three or four months ago. I don\u2019t know, Carlos, if you want to expand on that? Carlos Rodriguez : No, all I was thinking was that in some cases, if people pay us, we\u2019ll buy their companies. Ramsey El-Assal: All right, fantastic. I appreciate it. Thanks so much. Carlos Rodriguez : And then we can clean them up. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open. Mark Marcon : Good morning everybody, and congratulations on the quarter. I was wondering, could you give us a couple of updates with regards to some of the products? In terms of next generation pay, to what extent has that been further rolled out? What\u2019s the update there? Carlos Rodriguez : I would say we had a really good, I think, first--I would call it year end, because when you get to the midmarket, which is next gen pay, as you know right now is really being sold in a portion of what we call the core part of the midmarket, so call it 50 to 150, and I think we\u2019re at--we\u2019re selling somewhere between 20%, 25% of our clients, of our new businesses coming in on the new platform, and we expect to be GA, I think it\u2019s end of calendar-- Maria Black : This calendar year, that\u2019s right. Carlos Rodriguez : End of calendar year, so that\u2019s kind of what we talked about at investor day. I would say that, call it December-January sales season, because a lot of those clients, they want to start clean on January 1, so it\u2019s a fairly important point of the year in terms of judging where you are in terms of sales results and so forth, and we had a fairly good, I think, number of starts. We were happy, I would say, with the early January, late December, what I would starts results - in other words, those are clients that we sold previously, that we got started and we have up and running.  We try and avoid getting into specifics of how many clients, because then every quarter you guys are going to ask us, but I\u2019d say that that\u2019s going really well and we\u2019re on track for this GA by the end of the calendar quarter, and then we had a good start season for end of December, beginning of January. Mark Marcon : That\u2019s great. Then it sounds like--you know, one of the early comments that you gave, Carlos, was highlighting just the breadth, talking about how Roll is doing on the low end and then also mentioning that at one client, you had a million transactions in a single day, which is obviously impressive. Can you just give us a sense for in terms of Roll, how much is that--now that you\u2019ve had some experience with it, how much more excited are you about that possibility and penetrating that micro part of the market? Then on the flipside, with the capabilities of being able to service companies globally and at huge scale, how does that expand the top end of the market? Carlos Rodriguez : As you know, we\u2019re a little bit different than most in the sense that we\u2019re 100% all-in on HCM, and we cut across multiple segments and also geography, so that makes us a little bit unique, so you have to get excited within segment because--like, Roll is really exciting and we\u2019re excited about that opportunity, but that is in that micro segment because if you take the other extreme example of that other client, like when we process a million--that client obviously has a million employees, and we processed their payroll and we processed a million paychecks on one day. That\u2019s a lot of small Roll clients to make up for that. They\u2019re excited about that, but Roll is excited about its role in the growth of ADP and in the marketplace in terms of our ability to compete and to create opportunities for us. It\u2019s a little hard to compare. I guess it\u2019s like when you have multiple children, you have to love them all and they\u2019re all good looking and smart and so forth, and I think that\u2019s the way I feel about Roll in the down market versus the up market versus GlobalView. They really are all, I think, performing quite well now, and I think we\u2019re excited about the opportunity in each of those market segments.  I\u2019m trying not to give you a non-answer answer, but I think--I\u2019m trying my hardest to give you something concrete, but it\u2019s exciting because these are all--I mean, the growth rate, Dany won\u2019t allow me to say it because as we were preparing for the call, if we were a start-up, we would be quoting growth rates for Roll that would make your eyes roll, but Dany won\u2019t let me say it because it\u2019s really, frankly, insignificant to a $15 billion company today, but it won\u2019t be insignificant in five or 10 years. Mark Marcon : I guess that\u2019s what I was getting at, was on the--for example, in terms of Roll, when you first introduced it, you talked about it in a more modest manner, but it sounds like it\u2019s getting really good traction, so I was just wondering if there was some way to capture how you\u2019re thinking about how big that could eventually be. Carlos Rodriguez : It\u2019s definitely getting good traction. We\u2019re definitely excited about it, but again you shouldn\u2019t over--I\u2019m not trying to over-play it because we have a very large organization, and you guys need to think about how all the pieces fit together, so that it fits into our forecast. Just from a dollar impact, I hate to go back to that, that product and that segment competes against certain competitors. We feel pretty good about what we\u2019re going to be able to do there in terms of market share and growth, etc., but you should not be thinking about this as something that\u2019s going to move ADP\u2019s growth rate by one to two percentage points on the top line in the next year or two. That\u2019s just not the way the math works. I wish it did. All of these things have to work together - next gen payroll, next gen HCM, Roll, GlobalView, Celergo. There are a lot of things - PEO - that have to come together for us to get to the numbers, and we like that. We\u2019re, I think, a portfolio that, as you\u2019ve seen, we manage pretty effectively, and the combination of all of those businesses having good success, some more than others at times, I think leads to the results that we are reporting and forecasting. Mark Marcon : Appreciate that, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Eugene Simuni with MoffetNathanson. Your line is open. Eugene Sumuni : Thank you, good morning. Congrats on another strong quarter, guys. Wanted to ask about Wisely and your general personal finance product strategy. You highlighted the bill pay offering in your prepared remarks. Can you just remind us what are the next big milestones for this overall strategy, and I know it\u2019s a small part of your portfolio, but will you at some point maybe start providing some metrics that can help us track the growth of this area like some businesses like that provide, such as number of cardholders, frequency of transactions, the amount spent, and so on? Thank you. Maria Black : Yes, so happy to comment on the overall Wisely product strategy and where we\u2019re heading with the opportunity - it\u2019s incredibly exciting for us, and then we can talk through what those metrics could be to give some solid basis of growth over time.  As it relates to the overall MyWisely app and the strategy we have within the Wisely portfolio, it is really a strategy that is anchored in financial management. That financial management in the app happens through education, budgeting, savings tools, rewards. What you heard today, which you just mentioned as well, which is the launch of our bill pay feature, we believe is significant. It\u2019s exactly what we all probably use with respect to any type of an online bill pay, where you can scan the check and actually facilitate end-to-end bill processing through a mobile device, so that is all part of the MyWisely app and the overall financial management strategy - think financial wellness, etc. that we\u2019ve employed.  In addition to that, the other thing that\u2019s forthcoming is the launch of our early wage access, our EWA as we refer to it, which is really that ability for our clients\u2019 employees or employees to gain access to wages that they\u2019ve earned as they earn them, so this is also a big piece to the overall equation with respect to the overall Wisely. Things that we\u2019re monitoring actively right now, back to the question around how many cardholders, etc., certainly we\u2019re looking at that. We\u2019re looking at other types of what type of cardholders are using what feature functionality. There is some data that you could look at as it relates to how many reviews we have on the app, the quality of the app certainly supersedes some of the competition in the space. We\u2019re pretty proud of the impact that our financial wellness tool, MyWisely app is creating in the market. I\u2019ll let Dany or Carlos comment on cardholder tracking and when and if we\u2019ll disclose that. Carlos Rodriguez : Yes, I think we\u2019ll--I mean, that\u2019s a takeaway for us. We\u2019ll see if there\u2019s something else that we--I mean, we\u2019re always open to suggestions and trying to be open-minded about disclosure, but again, this is not the same as the conversation about Roll, but as excited as we are about Wisely, we\u2019re equally excited about things like Roll, and Wisely is much bigger than Roll. But again, relative--I hate to be a broken record, relative to the size of ADP, it wouldn\u2019t be at the top of the list of the things that are going to drive the overall results, because again, a portfolio of so many different things that have to go right and that we have to get right in order to get growth on $15 billion. I think that business is probably--I\u2019m trying to do the math in my head, it\u2019s like 2%, 3% or smaller in terms of total--actually smaller than that, even, in terms of revenue. By the way, we want that, and it is growing faster than the line average. All the things you\u2019re asking about are relevant, and those things would all help the overall growth rate of ADP, but it would be misleading--because I think others might have done that, where they make a bigger deal out of it than it really is, and maybe relative to their companies it is a big deal. Relative to us, we have lots of other things that we have to do and that have to go right, and us trying to pretend that--you know, if we tell you this is how much we get per card and then we start giving you math that if 100% of our clients got on the card, this is how much money we would have - I mean, we don\u2019t need to do that, because that\u2019s just distracting and silly, because first of all, it\u2019s not going to happen, we\u2019re not going to get 100 overnight, and it could take some time anyway. But we will take that away and think about what, if anything, we can do to give you a little more substance around progress around Wisely, because it\u2019s exciting and we\u2019re happy about it, but it\u2019s not--there are other parts of our disclosure that would give you more indications like the things we\u2019ve been talking about - pays per control, new business bookings, all those things overall are bigger drivers of our results. Eugene Sumuni : Got it, thank you very much, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. James Faucette : Thank you very much, and good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, but I wanted to talk just a little bit about, or ask about strategy. In the past, you\u2019ve mentioned customer service capabilities being a differentiator related to SaaS players. How should we think about the persistence of differentiated service levels as your own AI capability grows in importance and we look at the future of self service initiatives may cause your own services and service levels to look more like traditional SaaS players? I guess I\u2019m just wondering how we should be thinking about that strategically and what the implications are in the business. I recognize it probably fits well within a few of your most recent comments, like it takes a while to move the needle, but would love to get a sense of where you think you\u2019re going in those areas. Carlos Rodriguez : It\u2019s a great question because we--that\u2019s a topic that comes up not just among the management team, but also from the board, because we clearly see the opportunity there. Again, we have a couple of advantages coming out of the gate, like we obviously have a lot of data, so we have a lot of information that can be used to provide, I think, more automated, if you will, whether it\u2019s AI, machine learning, whatever term you want to use for it. You have to have information to be able to then monetize that or turn it into a value-add for the clients, which then can be monetized.  We spent a fair amount of time on that. We\u2019ve actually recently appointed someone to be our chief data officer, who is kind of overseeing and owning all of our data and then how we can marshal those resources to create the kinds of advantages that you\u2019re talking about, which are really advantages for our clients so that we can be able to hold onto them longer, sell them more things, etc. Everything from the simplest things, like chat bots to real true AI, I think are things that we have already deployed and I think are in the process of growing and scaling, if you will, to take advantage of, and I think some of those you\u2019ve seen around press releases, and we talked about some of them on investor day, but clearly there\u2019s a lot more opportunity in front of us that we\u2019ve already done in that area. I would say that that\u2019s a great question and a substantial opportunity for us, that to the previous point about disclosure, we have to find a better way of giving more guidance or more disclosure around how that\u2019s going and how it\u2019s being leveraged, because it\u2019s going to be meaningful, I think, over the next five to 10 years for ADP. James Faucette : That\u2019s great, appreciate it Carlos. Operator : We have time for one more question. That question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open. Jason Kupferberg : Thanks guys. I just wanted to start with the EPS guidance for fiscal \u201922 - I guess we\u2019re going up 1% at the midpoint, so call it $0.06. Just breaking that down, it looks like the raise in the float income expectations is about $0.04 of that, and presumably the rest  revenue outlook. I just wanted to see if that math is correct. Carlos Rodriguez : That sounds pretty good. I think that the theme--whether that\u2019s exactly right or not, the theme you should hear is--I mean, it\u2019s maybe a bad thing to end the call with, but you should understand that the second--we are investing, and this is not the first time you\u2019ve heard this from ADP. The opportunity in front of us is big, like our bookings are growing, the economy is growing robustly despite the noise in terms of the stock market and so forth. This is a really good environment for us, and so we are preparing ourselves, and you should expect that that is going to lead to long term improvement in, hopefully, our growth rates and in our margins and so forth.  Just don\u2019t get distracted by the short term noise, because I think if the implication is it doesn\u2019t seem like we raised the rest of whatever profit by much, the answer is you\u2019re probably right, but it\u2019s all the things we\u2019ve been talking about during the call, which is we\u2019re making sure that we keep up with the market in terms of wage growth, but we have price levers that we haven\u2019t necessarily hit yet because we\u2019re not a panicky company. We\u2019re not going to tomorrow do an unplanned price increase to our base, but we have times that are natural and normal where we will do that, but we\u2019re not going to wait to take action on wages and hiring and so forth until we get there, because that doesn\u2019t make sense. We\u2019re not some schleppy little company that needs to panic, so we\u2019re going to do the right things and if there\u2019s a timing, missed timing by a quarter or two, so be it.  We think it\u2019s still pretty damn good. When you think about the inflationary pressures we have and the fact that we\u2019re still able to deliver the results that we are delivering and able to grow the way we\u2019re delivering, we\u2019re pretty damn proud of it. But admittedly, we\u2019re feeling more pressure on the expenses now than we definitely felt, call it 18 months ago, right? It\u2019s the opposite, and this is what happens in, quote-unquote comparisons, and when, you quote-unquote lap things and all that stuff that you guys like to look at. The pandemic hit and our expenses went down because we were very careful and very frugal and very stingy in terms of hiring and so forth, and our revenues never came down as much as everyone thought and as we thought, and we now have to go back up and make sure that we\u2019re staffed, and at the same time wages started to increase and we have to now factor that into the picture. But we\u2019re feeling pretty damn good about our execution and how we\u2019re doing, but that is the way the numbers add up, is the way you described it. Jason Kupferberg : Okay, those are all good points. Just last one from me, I wanted to see if you could elaborate a little bit on the competitive landscape, just what you\u2019re seeing down market, midmarket, enterprise-wide. Interested in just any changes in the mix or the aggressiveness of any competitors across the spectrum. Thank you. Carlos Rodriguez : Again, because we compete in so many different segments, there\u2019s not--I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a broad sweep--I mean, some of our competitors only compete with us in one segment, so it\u2019s hard to make a sweeping statement other than I think it\u2019s business as usual. That may not be very exciting, but I don\u2019t see--I don\u2019t know, Maria, if you see any--there\u2019s been no--I mean, I think when we look at our balance of trade, we\u2019re pretty happy about a couple of people that we\u2019ve been more focused on recently than maybe before, which we\u2019re now doing better than before on. But as usual, there\u2019s others that are now gaining ground on us, but I\u2019d say that the general environment is stable and--what is it, the rising tide lifts all boats? It feels like the industry overall has a lot of, I don\u2019t know, growth opportunity and we\u2019re all getting our fair share and trying to steal each other\u2019s share, but it\u2019s a good environment. I don\u2019t know if you have any--? Maria Black : I concur. I would echo the sentiment on the overall HCM space and the environment, and I don\u2019t think anything has materially changed. But we certainly intend to continue to win our fair share and more. Jason Kupferberg : Okay, I appreciate that. Thanks guys. Operator : This concludes our question and answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you. Just back to the general economic conditions and what\u2019s happening in the market and so forth, which is not something that we focus on, on a day-to-day basis, but the some of the things--we did have a little bit of a discussion and some questions on capital allocation, structure and so forth, that I would just--I can\u2019t help but I\u2019m obsessed with the dividend, and I love how no one asked about the dividend. Nobody cares about the dividend, but we may be entering an environment where it might matter again, so maybe someday I\u2019ll get a question about the dividend, because I think we\u2019re in our 47th year of consecutive increases in a dividend, and I think if you go back 10 years and you look at what our cost basis of the stock was and what the dividend yield, given today\u2019s dividend, is on that cost basis five, 10 years ago, 15 years ago, 20 years ago, this company is a money machine, and clearly capital gains are important too but the focus changes, obviously, as the market environment changes. Listen, I\u2019m not wishing a downdraft in the market - it hurts us as much as it hurts anyone else, but I like where ADP is positioned competitively and I like where we\u2019re positioned in terms of our balance sheet, our dividend, and the way we allocate capital. But the most important thing I\u2019m proud of is our associates, because every quarter now as we get further away from--despite omicron and so forth, clearly we\u2019re in a much better place than we were before. We would not be where we are today without our associates, and I mentioned how we were understaffed for sure in the early times of the pandemic, because we felt like we had to be careful on the expense side, and as we were being careful, the workloads were increasing because of all the government regulation issues that were intended to help - and they did, all of the stimulus, and this was across the whole world. That created a ton of work for our people, of which we had fewer people, and I\u2019m incredibly grateful and will forever be indebted for people stepping up and doing whatever it took to get our clients and get us through that difficult period. I\u2019m so glad that we\u2019re able to deliver on all of our commitments, because we were, I think, one important factor besides the Amazon trucks still running and other parts of the economy still functioning. I think we played a role in helping the world economy, I think, get through the pandemic, and our associates deserve all the credit for the role they played. With that, I appreciate you listening to us, and we look forward to catching up with you again in the next quarter. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Michelle, and I'll be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Third Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Danyal Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Danyal Hussain : Thank you, Michelle, and welcome everyone to ADP's third quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. Participating today are Carlos Rodriguez, our CEO; Maria Black, our President; and Don McGuire, our CFO. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call. During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these items along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release. Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. And with that, let me turn it to Carlos. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you, Danny, and thank you everyone for joining our call. We delivered exceptionally strong third quarter results, including revenue that accelerated to 10% growth on a reported basis and 11% growth on an organic constant currency basis, coupled with solid adjusted EBIT margin expansion. The strong outcome on both revenue and margin drove 17% growth in adjusted diluted EPS, well ahead of our expectations. Our clients have had new shortage of challenges in navigating the last 12 months, but through it all not only have they persevere but they have invested in their workforce to better support their employees and continue to grow their businesses. We're proud to support them in these efforts through our leading HCM technology and unrivaled expertise. This quarter, I'll provide high-level commentary on key business drivers, and then Maria will take us through some product and other updates. And as usual, Don will discuss the financials and our updated outlook. Let me start with Employer Services new business bookings. We are very pleased to have delivered another strong quarter of double-digit growth. This was a record level for the third quarter. And as we had hoped when we updated you last quarter, the Omicron variant was not a meaningful factor in our bookings performance, as third quarter growth accelerated from our first half levels towards the high end of our guidance range this quarter. Our clients continue to find tremendous value across our suite of offerings with our PEO and HR outsourcing, international and downmarket businesses, again, leading the way. We're pleased to narrow our ES bookings guidance higher, and we look forward to delivering this double-digit growth for the full year, which should position us well for fiscal 2023. Our employer services retention was also very strong this quarter. As you know, our third quarter is especially important for retention since we typically experience elevated switching with the start of the new calendar year. Accordingly, we were very pleased that rather than decreasing the quarter towards pre-pandemic levels like we anticipated, our retention actually increased further into record territory driven by incredible performance from our mid-market and international businesses, among others. As we've discussed for several quarters, the strong employee and client growth we've experienced have increased the demands on our implementation and service organization. We added to our headcount to keep up with this demand ahead of our busy year-end period. And as a result, we were able to maintain strong overall client satisfaction scores despite ongoing pressure from this elevated demand. With retention having outperformed our expectations so far this year, we believe we are now on pace to hold on to most of last year's retention gains and expect to remain at 92% retention for the year, down very slightly versus last year's record retention level. Moving on to Employer Services pace for control, our clients continue to steadily hire as workers enter or reenter the labor force and our pays per control growth of 7% for the quarter came in better than expected. Clearly, there are a number of factors at play when considering employment growth trends, but strong overall economic activity continues to keep demand for labor high, and we've been pleased to see labor force participation gradually recover over the course of the year. And one last highlight before I turn it over to Maria. Our PEO had another strong quarter with 16% average worksite employee growth and 14% revenue growth. As we've seen all year, growth in our PEO bookings was exceptionally strong as small and midsized businesses increasingly find value in turning over a meaningful portion of their HR function to ADP. And that strong bookings performance, coupled with robust employment growth within the PEO base has driven this very healthy double-digit revenue growth. And now let me turn it over to Maria. Maria Black : Thank you, Carlos. It's great to be joining everyone for the call. Also some updates on a few key initiatives we have underway. One key product initiative is the rollout of our new unified user experience. And we made some great progress on this front. Earlier this year, we moved the RUN, iHCM and Next-Gen HCM client bases over to the new UX. Feedback has been strong with clients, especially upbeat about how easy we've made key HCM workflows. In January, we shared, we started the pilot of the new UX to Workforce Now and since then, we've expanded from a handful of clients to over 1,000, early feedback has also been overwhelmingly positive. In this quarter, we began the rollout of the new UX to the ADP Mobile app. The ADP Mobile app is an incredibly important part of the ADP suite with over 10 million active users. It is one of the top five most downloaded business apps in the Apple App Store and is available in over 20 languages. And we're excited to take our 4.7 star average user experience and make it even more insightful, intuitive, and proactive for our users. As we complete the new UX rollout over the coming months. Moving on, data continues to be one of our key differentiators in this quarter, we expanded our data offerings even further, as we launched pilot clients on our new global insight dashboard powered by DataCloud. This dashboard provides our GlobalView and Celergo clients with advanced analytics for their employee populations around the globe, leveraging the same award-winning analytics platform we have scaled across our U.S. mid and upmarket client bases. Last quarter, we mentioned you would hear a bit more about our marketing efforts here at ADP. At our Investor Day in November, I spoke about how for decades, ADP has reached prospects through our powerful direct sales force and how in more recent years, we have enhanced this direct channel with modern selling tools, a growing partner network, and with increased digital advertising. This quarter, we continued to advance our great momentum and expanded our overall brand investment with additional initiatives, including our first major athletic sponsorships, a group of eight impressive professional golfers featured across the LPGA, the PGA and the European Tour who together constitute team ADP. The ADP brand is a powerful asset and has come to be associated with professionalism, insightful and trustworthy data. And the premier technology and service we pride ourselves on, and we believe there's opportunity to continue investing in our brand while also pushing the frontier in digital marketing efforts to support our world-class sales force. And as a final call out, this quarter, we were pleased to host one of our marquee client events, ADP Meeting of the Minds in California, which was back in-person for the first time since 2019. This was our 37th Meeting of the Minds conference. And we took the opportunity to engage deeply with our enterprise clients on the changing world of work. What I love most about this event is as much as we enjoy sharing our perspective with our clients and showing them our latest HCM innovations, we also make the most of this opportunity by listening to and learning from them and having the event back in-person really makes a big difference. The third quarter was a terrific quarter overall, which you can see in our results and in the progress we made on key initiatives, we were recently named one of Fortune\u2019s Most Admired Companies for the 16th year in a row. And we are proud of this honor because it highlights our culture of continuous improvement, our consistency and our focus on being a true partner to our clients. A big thank you to our associates who make this all happen. Now over to Don. Don McGuire : Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. For our third quarter, we delivered 10% revenue growth on a reported basis and 11% on an organic constant currency basis. This revenue growth in turn supported adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 50 basis points, which was much better than the decline we expected. We achieved that margin expansion despite incremental investments in headcount and compensation we discussed last quarter. Through the combination of this strong adjusted EBIT growth, a slightly lower tax rate and a lower share count, we were able to deliver a 17% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share. Looking more closely at the segment results, our Employer Services revenue increased 8% on a reported basis and 9% on an organic currency basis. ES revenue has been supported all year long by strong retention and pays per control trends. And our double-digit bookings performance has been contributing nicely as well. In Q3, we also started to get a more meaningful contribution from client funds interest through the combination of our 15% client funds balance growth and an average yield that was nearly flat with the prior year. This year-over-year increase in client funds interest contributed about 0.5% to our revenue growth, which is a very nice outcome compared to the last several quarters. ES margin increased 120 basis points, well ahead of our expectations for the quarter and supported primarily by revenue growth. Moving on to the PEO segment. PEO revenue remains very strong and grew 14% in the quarter. Average worksite employee growth is the primary driver to PEO revenue and remained at a very robust 16%, reaching 688,000 average worksite employees for the quarter. We continue to benefit from the strong bookings growth we\u2019ve seen all year long, as well as healthy retention and pays per control growth within the PEO client base. PEO revenue growth is a bit lower than worksite employee growth this quarter, which is fairly atypical, impacting revenue for worksite employee was a mix shift towards WSEs with a slightly lower average wage and lower benefits participation, representing continued normalization back towards a pre-pandemic mix. That said, it\u2019s good to see a recovery in all parts of the workforce in our PEO. PEO margin was flat in the quarter and included higher selling expenses driven by our strong sales momentum. Moving on to our updated outlook for the year. For ES revenues, we are raising our guidance and now expect growth of about 7% up from our previous guidance of about 6%. There are a few drivers behind that increase. We are narrowing our ES bookings guidance higher to a range of 13% to 16% up from 12% to 16% prior. So far this year, we have realized and delivered solid double digit growth. Clearly, there was geopolitical uncertainty in Europe, as well as more general macro uncertainty. But notwithstanding those uncertainties, our outlook contemplates a strong Q4 with growth in the teens and we look forward to delivering a strong finish to the year. We are raising our employer services retention guidance, and now expected to be down only 20 basis points for the year versus our prior expectation of down 40 basis points. Our retention has held up extremely well so far this year, but at a prudence, we are assuming a modest decline in Q4 for the same reasons we\u2019ve outlined all year long. For U.S. pays per control, we\u2019re once again, raising our outlook and now expect 6% to 7% growth versus our prior expectation of 5% to 6% growth driven by the ongoing recovery in the labor force participation combined with steady demand for labor from our clients. We are also raising our client funds interest outlook slightly to a range of $450 million to $455 million up from our prior expectation of $440 million to $450 million. There\u2019s no change to our 18% to 20% balance growth outlook with just a few months remaining in fiscal 2022, the benefit from higher new purchase rates for the recent yield curve shifts is modest. And therefore, we still expect yield to round to 1.4% for the year. Moving on to ES margin. We are raising our outlook to now expect margins to be up 100 to 125 basis points versus up 75 to 100 basis points prior. This increase is mainly driven by the stronger revenue outlook and margin performance in Q3 versus our expectations. Moving on to the PEO. We are narrowing our average worksite employee growth to 14% to 15% versus 13% to 15% prior driven by continued momentum in new business bookings. We are likewise narrowing total PEO revenue to 14% to 15% growth up from 13% to 15% growth prior. And we are raising PEO revenues, excluding zero margin pass-throughs to 15% to 17% growth from 14% to 16% growth prior. For PEO margin, we are raising our guidance to now expect margins to be up 25 to 50 basis points rather than flat to down 50 basis points for the year. That\u2019s driven by an improvement in pass-through expenses, including more favorability from workers compensation compared to our prior outlook. Putting it together for our consolidated outlook, we now expect revenue to grow 9% to 10% up from 8% to 9% prior. For adjusted EBIT margin, we now expect an increase of 75 to 100 basis points, up from 50 to 75 basis points prior. We are making no change to our tax rate assumption. And we now expect growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share of 15% to 17% up from 12% to 14% prior. Before we move on to Q&A, I wanted to quickly touch on fiscal 2023. We\u2019re still going through our planning process. And so we won\u2019t be providing any specifics this time. Clearly, there are going to be some unique puts and takes for fiscal 2023, but overall, we feel very good about the momentum in the business and we will remain focused on our medium-term growth objectives that we laid out at our November Investors Day. We look forward to providing our outlook next quarter. Thank you. And I\u2019ll turn \u2013 now turn it back to the operator for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Peter Christiansen with Citi. Your line is open. Peter Christiansen : Thank you and good morning and congrats on the solid execution this quarter, guys. Carlos, I had a question about for a number of quarters, we talked about ASO, HRO becoming a larger contributor to ES. Just wondering if you had any thoughts on how that\u2019s contributing to the stickiness of retention at this point? And then as a follow-up, given all the UI upgrades you\u2019ve given across the platform, how does that translate to growth to add-on services? I\u2019m thinking even things like pay wisely, those sorts of ancillary value-added products. Thank you. Carlos Rodriguez : Sure. I\u2019ll take the first part and I\u2019ll let Maria takes the second part. On the HRO business within ES, which as you know, is kind of our full outsourcing solutions or without the co-employment, the growth there has been quite robust on bookings, which obviously then is driving really robust growth in revenues. The interesting thing about that business, I mean, you have to \u2013 you almost have to call out. It\u2019s nice to be able to do it publicly, just unbelievable execution because in our business, when you get that kind of growth, that quickly, it\u2019s very, very hard to manage. But somehow they\u2019ve managed to stay ahead into terms of headcount hiring for both implementation and service. And the business is just really performing incredibly well. Retention rates are holding up. Not just holding up, I think they are up versus the prior year, which was already a strong year. And I would say contributing to the overall improvement in retention and stickiness. So I would say that that is probably \u2013 I would get in trouble for saying this, because then I offend all the other businesses, but that\u2019s got to be one of the star performers. Now the PEO obviously isn\u2019t doing incredibly well. Also and you can see that as a separate segment, it\u2019s a little harder to see the HRO business. It\u2019s also getting big. I think if I\u2019m not mistaken, it\u2019s \u2013 probably never publicly disclosed it, but it\u2019s getting close to $1 billion in revenue. So that\u2019s a pretty solid business with again, without \u2013 I\u2019m probably not right to give you too much detail, but revenue growth is strong double digits, very strong double digits with a two in front of it, let\u2019s say. And bookings growth is incredibly robust as well, retention is strong. Just really performing very well. Maria Black : With respect to the new user experience. So I mentioned a bit about it during my prepared remarks, very excited, obviously about the impact of the user experience across the entire portfolio. In terms of what it\u2019s going to do with respect to attach, I think you mentioned wisely and other attach. It\u2019s hard to tease out specifically the impact of the new user experience at this point in the quarter or even for the year as it relates to any material impacts to bookings or to attach. However, we definitely believe in what we\u2019ve developed and the impact that\u2019s going to make. So just to give a tiny bit more color. The new user experience is really based on a research driven design. That research driven design included our clients, as well as our prospects to create a user experience that\u2019s very action-oriented and it\u2019s navigation. What that means specifically is the ability to move through the process payroll, if you will or to your question, the ability to buy and attach in a very action-oriented navigation, which means you don\u2019t really need to know what\u2019s next in order to move through it. It also leverages artificial intelligence as well as machine learning to create a very personalized experience for the buyer or the user, if you will. So that it remembers how the specific individual likes to navigate through the system and serves it up that way in following subsequent sequences of usage. So the other part that we\u2019re very excited I mentioned rolling out the new user experience across the ADP mobile app. The mobile experience, one of the things that will really become a competitive advantage for us is the fact that the mobile experience will be not just for the end user such as that person that would actually purchase wisely, but also for the practitioner. And so a fully web-enabled user experience using the new user interface will certainly lend itself to a better competitive advantage for us in the future. And so as you can tell by my commentary very excited what this is going to do for us both as it relates to our sellers being able to demo and gain volume there, as well as our buyers and clients being able to engage in something a lot more user friendly, so that we can attach more business. Peter Christiansen : Thank you. Thank you, both. Congrats again, on the solid result. Operator : Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open. If your telephone is muted, please unmute. Tien- tsin Huang : Forgive me. I\u2019m sorry about that. Hope you can hear me now. Great results for sure. It looks like you\u2019re taking some share again. On the PEO side, I just want to make sure I understood the PEO revenue growth coming in beneath WSE growth. I know you said it was unusual. Some of it was benefits participation and salary driven. But just trying to understand is that more of a mean reversion change that you\u2019re talking about? Or is there a quality sort of focus that maybe we should honing in? I\u2019m just trying to better understand that trend and if it might persist for some time. Carlos Rodriguez : Listen, I\u2019m glad for the question. And I\u2019m also glad for the answer, right? Because mean reversion is my favorite term in business because when you get into large businesses and large economies, it\u2019s a powerful force in the universe. And that\u2019s exactly what it is. If you remember, this happened with some of the data that was reported by the Fed and by us in terms of employment. That in the initial stages of the pandemic, the jobs that went away the most quickly in terms of quantity were kind of lower wage jobs that in general don\u2019t have high benefits participation rates. Even though our PEO is generally white collar to gray collar, we experienced the same thing there in the PEO. So ironically at that time, it looked like our benefits per employee \u2013 worksite employee were rising, but it was really because of the averages and because of the mix shift. And now we have this mean reversion where even though the white collar jobs are growing and wages are growing, like everything is going exactly as you would want and expect in the PEO. You have this unusual thing because of the pandemic with a lot more jobs coming back that are people who don\u2019t have benefits. So it makes the benefits revenue grow slower than the worksite employee number. But it has nothing to do with any kind of policy change or change in kind of our philosophy or it\u2019s really just a re-normal or a normalization back in my opinion to where we were before. We\u2019re trying to assess kind of how long that takes and it\u2019s probably another quarter or two. There\u2019s a second factor that I think that\u2019s contributing to this, which is that state unemployment rates are coming in a little bit lower than we had expected because some states because of the strong employment market, even though they initially raised unemployment rates, because they thought that were going to have big problems in terms of people filing for unemployment. Obviously now what\u2019s happening, it\u2019s going in the other direction. And a few large states have actually lowered unemployment rates. That\u2019s not a \u2013 it\u2019s a factor. It\u2019s not a huge factor. I think that the mix shift issue is mathematically and this mean reversion is 95% of the explanation. By the way, we don\u2019t necessarily mind it one way or the other, because as you know, we treat benefits revenue as a pass-through. So there\u2019s really no profit and no margin. So it\u2019s really not relevant for us in terms of how we manage the business. Other than we have to explain it to obviously our sales community. Tien- tsin Huang : Yes. Thank you for the complete answer. It\u2019s really helpful. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Your line is open. Bryan Bergin : Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Question around bookings. So you cited an acceleration toward the high end of the range in 3Q and you were tracking below that in the first half of the year. So I\u2019m curious, what were the key drivers of that better performance you saw in 3Q? Was it larger deals that were converting or some improvements in sales force productivity trends? And then just on the outlook for the fiscal year, it sounds like you are confident that momentum here is carrying through as well as, I guess, the removal of potential Omicron conservatism. So I just wanted to clarify if that was fair. Maria Black : Fair enough. We did see strength in the third quarter. As you mentioned, we saw strength that was in line with the higher end of our full year guidance in the third quarter specifically. So an accelerated result. We expected that and we delivered that. We did see strength in our down market businesses. So specifically the RUN platform sales as well as retirement services. We also saw strength in our international business. And then last but not least, I think Carlos mentioned during his prepared remarks, the strength that we saw in PEO booking with the entire HRO portfolio, which is what\u2019s reported in employer services did have specific strengths. So again, that\u2019s the down market, RUN, retirement, international and the employer services, HRO that\u2019s where we saw the strength in terms of how we feel stepping into the fourth quarter. In terms of end quarter, the strength that we saw was actually delivered toward the end of the quarter, if you will, in March. And that really gave us the confidence to narrow our guidance heading into the fourth quarter and feel optimistic as we step into the fourth quarter with respect to the overall macroenvironment. And so you mentioned the Omicron that we noded to last quarter. We didn\u2019t see that materialize. And as we sit here today, the economic tailwinds that we see in the market, the challenges that businesses are facing with the increased complexity of new legislation and the tight labor market. There are a lot of things that are out that are giving us the confidence that we will continue to execute in the fourth quarter. And as such, we felt it right to narrow the guidance range to the 13% to 16% for the full year outlook. Don McGuire : And just as a reminder, when we talk about bookings, I think Maria mentioned it, and I\u2019m sure all of you remember that we really talk about ES bookings. So a couple years ago that we changed our approach to disclosures because we thought that disclosures in the PEO were better in a format where we really talked about growth of worksite employees. It\u2019s very easy to kind of do the math in the PEO when you talk in those terms. But to be crystal clear, if PEO bookings were included in overall bookings, they would have been meaningfully higher for ADP. Bryan Bergin : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And I know you don\u2019t want to quantify fiscal 2023 outlook yet. I\u2019ll give this a shot. What are some of the puts and takes we should be thinking about for next year? Anything you want to call out as it may relate to comps or dynamics from this fiscal year that may not necessarily carry forward? Carlos Rodriguez : Yes. I think that first of all, no specifics for 2023, we\u2019re going to wait until the next earnings call we have before we give more color on 2023. But as I said earlier, we\u2019re very comfortable with the fundamentals and we think we\u2019re in a good spot. We\u2019ve overcome some of the challenges that we referenced last quarter in terms of making sure we\u2019re appropriately staffed for the bigger business that we now have. We did that well going into the busiest quarter of the year. So that\u2019s all in good shape. Certainly, you guys are probably better at the numbers than me on what\u2019s the potential impact from flow balances, et cetera. Certainly, it\u2019s pretty clear that we will have higher client fund interest next year. However, how much, we\u2019re not quite sure yet, even though we\u2019re seeing rates go up, certainly there\u2019s lots of volatility in the rates. There\u2019s certainly lots of things going on. But I\u2019ll come back to the way I ended my prepared remarks and that was that we very much will be mindful of what we share with everybody at the Investor Day in November. And we will make sure that we have those targets in mind, as we prepare when we get ready to release more information on 2023. Don McGuire : And it\u2019s a non-GAAP term, but it\u2019s safe to say that client funds interest will be up a lot. Bryan Bergin : All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Eugene Simuni with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Eugene Simuni : Thank you. Good morning. I\u2019ll start with a macro level question. So ADP obviously has its finger on the pulse with very large slides of the U.S. economist. So it\u2019s always very interesting to hear you guys perspective on kind of real time read of what\u2019s going on across the different pockets of your client base, especially now that we\u2019re experiencing kind of volatile macroenvironment. Would you mind providing us with a little bit of that commentary what do you see in today across your client base markets of strength and weakness? Carlos Rodriguez : Sure. As you know, obviously our commentary is generally focused on the labor markets. Like this morning, I was hearing reports about what\u2019s happening with consumer spending, which is quite robust that obviously ends up having an impact on the labor markets, because people who are in the service sector or people who are serving consumers end up hiring people in order to fulfil that demand. But generally speaking, our comments are really around the labor markets. And as you can see from our pays per control growth, some of which is related to the previous question about comparisons, right? Like the comparisons are easier and they will get harder next year in terms of percentages. But the percentages don\u2019t matter as much as the absolute numbers, right? And the absolute numbers are strong, I think are robust. And I think as we alluded to the labor market is almost fully recovered. We obviously keep an eye also on things like GDP, GDP growth. I mean, absolute GDP dollars have already surpassed pre-pandemic levels. And they\u2019re kind of in line to get back to trend growth or exceed trend growth on a real basis, right? Because you have to factor in obviously the fact that we have some higher inflation now. I mean, our perspective generally is that the economy is very strong, like based on the things that we\u2019re looking at in our business. But we obviously live in the real world that we have to think about the next quarter or two, but also about 12 months from now and 24 months from now. And Finance 101 would tell you that increase in interest rates that are expected from the Fed and that have already been priced in, which are helping our client fund interest on the two year, five year, seven year and 10 years, I think will all slow at some point the economy, which is the intention, I think of the federal reserve to get inflation under control. Having said all that, you have to make your own decisions on whether or not that will be navigated appropriately to a \u201csoft landing\u201d. But we had 10 years from 2011 through or call it 2010 through 2020 before, right before the pandemic of what I would call relatively, historically speaking reasonable growth in GDP call it 2%, 2.5% GDP growth, gradually recovering employment. So, if we go from 3% or 5% GDP growth, the 2.5% or 2%, we like that. And I think we\u2019ve delivered some pretty outstanding results for all stakeholders during that kind of period of time. So we would not like a recession, just like no one else would like a recession. But I think if you believe that the best of is behind us that doesn\u2019t necessarily need that things are not going to be good going forward. Because we \u2013 all the indicators we\u2019re seeing right now are really strong underlying labor markets. And we also have in the U.S. an administration that will be in the seat for another call it three years, despite what happens in the midterms that is, generally more favorable towards employment regulation and \u2013 and that, I think, is a favorable tailwind for our business as well in terms of just on a macro \u2013 on a very macro level. So I think we like the environment. If the best scenario for us, frankly, which would be a homerun is that growth gradually slows not to the point where there's a recession, but where interest rates stay at the rates that they're at, particularly like kind of the three to five and the seven years, and that really is a pretty large tailwind for us from a bottom line standpoint. Eugene Simuni : Got it. Got it. Thank you. Very, very helpful. And then quickly for my follow-up, staying with the macro theme, inflation is obviously running high, so maybe for Don. Can you give us a quick overview of how inflation you think influenced impacted your results this quarter? What were the puts and takes in the P&L from inflation? Don McGuire : Yes. So we've done a couple of things over the last quarter, as we said, we were going to on the last call and we did an off-cycle salary increase to make sure that we kept our associates happy and whole. So that was positive. We also had some bonus programs and some sales conditions, accrued programs that were certainly anticipated and booked in the quarter. So we are \u2013 from a cost side, we were able to do those things and still deliver the improved margins. So we think that was very positive for us to do. The other side of this, of course, is price increases, and the two aspects of the price increases. Certainly, we haven't yet \u2013 although planned, we haven't yet initiated large price increases with our installed base. We will make sure that we do those things accordingly, reflecting inflation and most importantly reflecting to make sure that our clients still get great value from us in a competitive environment. And what we did do though and we signaled this in the last call as well, we have increased the pricing on some of our new offers, our new offer sales we \u2013 sales we had in the last quarter. But that's having a very minimal impact on Q3 and certainly won't have an enormous impact on the full year either. So we are making sure that we're focused on pricing both in the base and with new opportunities, new prospects and making sure that we're adjusting our wage levels to keep our employees and deliver the good service that we've delivered that is contributing to the high retention rate we have. Carlos Rodriguez : And the only other thing that I would add that we may not always directly linked to inflation as I am beating the dead horse here, but the client funds interest, obviously, inflation is what's driving these higher interest rates. It also happens to also drive higher balances. A lot of our balances are driven by our tax business, but wages, some of those taxes capped, but for example federal withholding taxes are not necessarily capped. So the more people get paid, the more taxes we collect and have to remit to various agencies and wages are a portion of our float balances. And clearly, there is an impact from there. Overall wage inflation, forget about our own inflation that Don is referring to, but the inflation in our client base in terms of their own \u2013 the wages of their employees is really driving \u2013 is helping our balance growth for sure. But more importantly, it's obviously driving a belief that interest rates need to rise rather rapidly, which is now being already factored in into \u2013 even though the Fed controls obviously fed funds rate you can all see what's happening with the one year, two year, three year, five year and what the expectation is for and that's all related obviously directly to inflationary expectations. Eugene Simuni : Got it. Got it. Very comprehensive. Thank you very much guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Kartik Mehta : Good morning. I was just hoping maybe to get a little bit more on the pricing comments you made if you look at pricing and compared to what you anticipate getting and compared it to historical levels, what will be a good way to \u2013 are you able to kind of quantify that or maybe just a good way to think about the opportunity ADP has going forward? Carlos Rodriguez : I think the safest thing for us to say right now because, as Don said, we really haven't finalized that yet as we have not finalized our 2023 operating plan. So I think Don was giving you kind of directional color, which is 100% accurate. We've been doing a lot of work, and Maria and the team have been doing a lot of work on what's the appropriate pricing policy, if you will. Don mentioned the fact that on new business, it's relatively easy because that's something that we control timing-wise, whereas price changes to the book of business, we have a cycle that we go through, and we decided not to do anything unnatural or out of cycle. So that that decision is still kind of in front of us. But I think Don used the word competitive, we do not live in a vacuum. And so, we are going to do what's appropriate based on what's happening with inflation, but also with what's happening with competitors. So we're going to be watching very carefully what everyone is doing from the \u2013 obviously from the sidelines since we obviously don't have any direct insight into what our competitors are doing. But you get competitive signaling and you get hearsay here and there. So we're looking at all those things, but it's safe \u2013 I guess the best way to describe it is whatever our price increase had been historically and it was probably consistent for almost 10 years in terms of kind of what we were telling you in terms of what it represented in as a percent of revenue. It's safe to say that that's going to be higher. And you kind of have to draw your own conclusions if inflation was 2% and now it's 4% to 5%, you could infer because our costs not just our wage cost, which Don alluded to, we've already had to kind of build in higher costs for our own associates. We have other costs. We have other services and other things that are being provided to us that are like every other company and we got to cover those costs. I think our philosophy is we would like to be in line with what's happening in the market. Kartik Mehta : And then just, Don, one last question. Just on the float portfolio, any thoughts about changing how you manage it or going shorter or longer, just because of where rates are and the volatility at least in the near-term? Don McGuire : We get this question often. And at the end of the day, we keep coming back to the same thing, and that's the safety diversification and liquidity of what we invest in. And so, it's unlikely we're going to make any major changes to the way we invest funds. I think we want to be \u2013 we want to certainly do well with our portfolio, but we also want to be prudent and so we'll continue to do that. So there's really no impeditive or imperative for us to make any changes to the way we've been managing those funds in the near, mid to long term. Carlos Rodriguez : And I think it's also safe to say that our philosophy is that we run an HCM technology services company. And this is a really nice side benefit that for however long we've been in this business, we have this float income, and it goes up and down based on interest rates and the economy and so forth. And I think compared to ten years ago, it's a much smaller portion of our bottom line. And so, that is both good and bad, right. I would have enjoyed my life and my tenure a lot more had interest rates not been as low as they were for as long as they were. But having said all that, it puts us in a much better position where it's much more clear now that ADP's core earnings are not driven by fluctuations in interest rates. And the reason we ladder our portfolio is primarily because as Don said about safety and security and liquidity, but it's also because philosophically we're not trying to gain the market, we're not trying to time the market, we are running an HCM technology services business, and that's our focus. Kartik Mehta : Thank you very much. I really appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Nice results on margins in the quarter. You guys beat our number pretty handily despite, I think, a headcount increase that \u2013 could you help us think through the puts and takes with that performance in terms of sales productivity or other drivers? And also sort of how you're thinking about those primary levers for margin expansion as we move forward? Don McGuire : Yes. So as I said a few minutes ago, we're very happy with the ability to hire quite a number of service implementation people going into this \u2013 going into the third quarter because that's obviously the busiest time of our year. So we made sure that we got as many people in as we could and we did quite well. And I think the retention rates are suggesting that we've continued to do a good job on behalf of our clients because they're sticking around. So very, very positive. Going forward, I think as we \u2013 once again, you're coming back to the plan a little bit that we're still putting together. But certainly, as we continue to grow, we'll continue to make sure that we staffed accordingly. And really not too much color to add there other than we've been successful at the hiring as we said we would be and it's not going to \u2013 it's not going to change dramatically and have any different impact on our overall margin than what we anticipated. And I don't know the sales continue to go very well, doing very well. We've talked the last time about productivity and things reverting back to means. And I don't know, Maria, if you want to make a comment about sales productivity, we've had good results. Maria Black : Yes, happy to add there. The investments that we're making into the overall sales ecosystem continue to be very balanced. So it's really all about the seller enablement. So as mentioned many times, we have this world-class sales force that's out there directly distributing our products and we enable them with an entire ecosystem of modern seller tools. That's definitely where we spent the last couple of years investing, especially as clients continue to pivot between wanting in-person and virtual. So seeing great productivity there, also seeing investments in brand and marketing and advertising. That's a big piece of the balanced approach that we take. And again, I don't see huge shifts in terms of the balanced approach that we're taking, but it is really an area that we continue to invest. I should mention to in that laundry list, digital advertising. So that's an area that we continue to see significant performance year-on-year in our down market and our mid-market in terms of the execution there. So all of these things are really about continuing the approach that we've had to enable the strong sales execution that we've seen this year and going forward. Don McGuire : One last thing on margins that I would add because I think it's something that we've been for years talking about is just a reminder that the overall ADP margin does get impacted by the mix of PEO and the growth rate of PEO compared to Employer Services. So from a GAAP standpoint, we do include zero margin pass-throughs and we believe that's the right approach and I think the SEC believes that's the right approach. But I think clearly, if you took out zero margin pass-throughs from the PEO, you'd have a very different margin profile of that business and hence you would have a very different margin overall for ADP. I only raised that because it is important to look at those two separately because you do have a mix shift issue that happens that doesn't necessarily tell you what the underlying strength of those businesses are. And that sometimes helps us in terms of our story, sometimes it hurts us, but it's the appropriate thing to guide you to, to look at. Because in this case, for example, the underlying margin is much higher because of the pressure that we're getting from zero margin pass-through as a result of that mix. Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. That's very helpful. And could you comment on or update us on your sort of M&A and/or capital allocation strategy? And just in the context of the current macro backdrop, are you seeing the opportunity, M&A opportunities change? Or how are you framing that up internally in terms of your priority \u2013 prioritization? Don McGuire : Yes. So I'll just start with opportunities. Certainly, as always, there is no shortage of things floating around and things to assess and review, et cetera. So we continue to do that. But as Carlos has said and we've said over a long period of time, if we're ever going to do anything other than a tuck-in here and there, which we had \u2013 we did have one in Q2. But other than tuck-in here and there, we're very disciplined in making sure that we're just not adding additional products where we already have products and making sure that we can keep our portfolio as clean as possible. So we continue to look at opportunities and evaluate things and we will make the right choices when the time \u2013 should the time come. On the \u2013 just in terms of our overall philosophy, I don't think we've changed our philosophy. We continue to be committed to the share buybacks that we've committed to dividends in the 55% to 60% range, although we were a little bit higher. I think we were 61% last year, but we're committed to that 55% to 60% range. the \u2013 even though the markets are off, just back to opportunities for M& a little bit more, even though the markets are off a little bit, and I think that the valuations that are out there are still quite high, the expectations at a number of people, who are looking to do something with their current operations, their expectations really haven't adjusted to or reflected what we're seeing in the market. So it's not any easier yet, but we will watch, we will evaluate. And if we see something or things that make sense, we'll do. It's appropriate. Ramsey El-Assal: Got it very well. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open. Mark Marcon : Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to dig in a little bit on the bookings commentary. Can you talk a little bit about with RUN? You saw strong growth there. How much of that was new businesses versus competitive takeaways? And how would you characterize the competitive takeaways? Are they from your biggest competitor in Rochester? Or are you seeing more from locals and regionals that haven't been able to keep up with the technology changes? Just any sort of depth there? And then can you also talk a little bit about the retirement service solutions that you have and what you're seeing there? And lastly, can you discuss a little bit what you're seeing with regards to Workforce Now and the mid-market? Maria Black : So happy to be the one to start here in terms of the strength in bookings. So specifically to RUN, Mark, I think in terms of the commentary around the competitors in Rochester and others, what I would say there is our continued focus on competitive takeaways has not waned. In terms of the strength of actual RUN sales and bookings performance, it's partially anchored in the amount of new business formations that we've continued to see. And so, there is definitely strength there, but certainly not for a lack of interest in the competitive side of the house. To touch on retirement services for a minute as well since you asked about that, I would say there's definitely tailwinds there in terms of attach specific to our RUN portfolio. And so as you're aware, significant legislative changes that have happened in the retirement environment state by state, and that's yielded a tailwind for us in terms of the offer that we have and certainly that makes an impact in terms of our ability to sell new logos as well as competitive takeaways because the combination of RUN and retirement and that in this type of an environment is an incredibly compelling to compete out there in the market. So I don't know, Carlos, if you have anything else to add to that. Carlos Rodriguez : No, I mean, we try to stay away from obviously any kind of \u2013 making comments about specific competitors, but I would say that specifically in SBS, we do watch this kind of balance of trade very carefully. And I think \u2013 I talk about it every quarter in terms of it's important to me, like one of the most important things for us in terms of long-term sustainability, and durability of our business is market share is really being able to grow units. We also love share of wallet and we love to sell additional business, et cetera, but that's important to us. And at least the figures that we're seeing in terms of our large national competitors, our balance of trade remains positive and improved in the third quarter versus the second quarter. So that to me tells me that I think we're still I think in a good place competitively and that we're doing all the right things, but having said that it's a very competitive market. There's no question about that. And everyone, I think has including some of our national competitors that have good products and good go-to-market strategies. And we are in the trenches every day competing in trench warfare with some of those competitors, we feel pretty good based on the data that we keep track of that we are doing well in terms of balance of trade and also in terms of market share. Don McGuire : And Mark, you asked about Workforce Now bookings. So we shared color on some of this already, but in addition to the HRO business, which is doing really well and uses Workforce Now. And then the PEO business, which also uses Workforce Now, there's just the mid-market HCM solution, we didn't call it out, but that also did very well double-digit growth. Carlos Rodriguez : And I think the other last one you asked about was retirement services. That business, as you probably know has some significant tailwinds because of regulatory changes that are going to get, they're going to become potentially GaelForce wins, in terms of with a new, I think it's called SECURE 2.0 or because I think the first one was the SECURE Act looks like it's going to make its way through Congress with bipartisan support and the first wave and the first version of that has already created some strong demand. In addition to what was already happening at the state level, where several states were requiring small businesses to mandatorily required to provide a retirement plan. So all those things are tailwinds for that business and that would be one of those businesses that I would describe as doing incredibly well, but trying to keep its head above water to meet demand. It's a good problem to have, trust me like I've been around long enough to know these are \u2013 this is a good problem to have. But it's still a problem. And so we're busy adding resources and trying to be appropriately staffed in our RF business, because it's definitely a growth engine. Mark Marcon : Can you size it Carlos, in terms of \u2013 I mean, we're aware of the becoming GaelForce wins. Just wondering how meaningful it's going to end up being to you on the whole? Carlos Rodriguez : I would say just general range. So you have some sense it's smaller than the HRO business, for example. So you shouldn't assume that we have $1 billion business, so you don't start getting too many images of grandeur. But it's a big business, call it maybe somewhere around half-ish of that business. I don't know, Danny, before I get into trouble, hundreds of millions of dollars. But growing, I think also at one of the faster rates, I think in terms of our businesses here and both for bookings and for revenue. Mark Marcon : Great. And then the follow up is just, Carlos, you mentioned your non-GAAP description in terms of interest income on the float for next year, how much of that, when we take a look at the Analyst Day discussion and the margin discussions. We typically look at the margin expansion ex-float, how much of the float would you let flow through? I know you aren\u2019t giving us the 2023 guidance, but just philosophically, how are you thinking about that? Carlos Rodriguez : Well, first of all, philosophically, we don't hide anything. So as you know, there's a nice little schedule that we include that allows everyone to do the math. And so next quarter, I'm sure you're going to do the math. And you'll ask us how come you are or aren't allowing X percent to flow through because the math is actually fairly straightforward. We give you the balances that are maturing in that year, because since we ladder the only relevant issue is really what's maturing as well as new money invested in that year, which is what benefits from the higher rates since we hold to maturity. And you'll know we'll give you a forecast of what our balance growth is going to be. And we'll also give you a forecast of what yields are going to be in the next year. So you'll have all that math and it'll be very easy to do. And then what you'll have to do is quiz us on what the other side of the ledger in terms of what are the other factors in terms of that led to the final reported or in that case guided net income figures or EBIT figures. And I think one of the things that's changed from Investor Day is that there's no question that, interest rates are way up and client funds interests \u2013 our forecast for client funds interest would be much higher because you can do the math, just like we can, the other \u2013 the variable that we want to take another quarter to make sure that we think through and that we finalize our plans before we communicate is that inflation is also way up in multiple ways, including on wages as Don alluded to, right. So when we had Investor Day, we had not yet taken this action of an off-cycle merit increase or wage increase, we had not yet which we are now fully accrued for some of our incentive bonuses, which are driven primarily by performance, but come in handy when you are competing for talent and trying to hold on to talent. And so those are all things that we have to kind of weigh now. And then the last factor being, I think Don talked about price increases, where does that finally land will also have an impact. So, there's a few more moving parts then I think is typical for us. And I think it's important for us to make sure we add it all up and rack it all up. But one thing I can guarantee you is you will have transparency. Mark Marcon : Always appreciate that. Thank you, Carlos. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open. Mihir Bhatia : Good morning. This is Mihir on for Jason. Thank you for taking a question. I wanted to ask about the competitive intensity and pricing actions. Maybe just talk a little bit about the pricing and promotional environment that you're seeing currently. Are we back at pre-pandemic levels in the pre-pandemic trends, any changes, worth calling out in the mix or aggressiveness of competitors and particular segments even, I know you compete across a lot of different segments, so anything you can help us there? Maria Black : Yes. So Carlos alluded to the competitive intensity. I think you called it trench warfare and that's certainly the case. I think in terms of being back to pre-pandemic levels, with respect to pricing and promos, we're definitely seeing the competitive intensity that would be reflective of prior years, both as it relates to the trench warfare as well as the pricing element of it. So I think it's fair to assume that it's still very competitive. I think that's part of the reason that as we think about our price increases whether it's on the new business side or on the existing client base, we're being incredibly thoughtful market-by-market, call it country-by-country, segment-by-segment, product-by-product to ensure that we continue to remain thoughtful in terms of the overall price value equation that does keep us remaining in a competitive pricing environment. So I would say that the intensity has not waned. It continues and very formidable competitors out there, and we're confident that we continue to win in the market and that we continue to take a balanced approach on the price value equation. Mihir Bhatia : Great. Thank you. And then just maybe turning to the growth in average worksite employees, can you talk about what is driving the strength you're seeing there? Is it in particular verticals? Is it broad based, any additional color you can provide there? Thank you. Carlos Rodriguez : I mean, I think probably the biggest picture, the answer is no, there's no specific verticals or whatnot. We're too big and too diversified to really \u2013 it's not geographic or verticals or all that. It's basically very strong bookings with very good retention and also growth of the client base. This pays per control that we talk about in Employer Services, you have the same phenomenon in the PEO where the clients themselves are recovering, right and hiring at a faster rate than they would have been because they had either shrunk or hadn't hired during the pandemic. And so that is a tailwind also for the PEO, but the biggest factors are sales minus losses. And then what's happening with the base, which is obviously strong. Mihir Bhatia : Thank you. Operator : We have time for one last question and it comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. James Faucette : Great. Thank you so much. I wanted to follow up on a question and it has to do with the competitive intensity, but I guess, previously you talked about, you had some expectation for slight retention deterioration, but that isn't playing out. And in fact, it seems like your outlook is improving. You mentioned mid-market and international are main contributors, but are you seeing anything also in terms of business closures in the down market that's performing better, or any other contributors that are helping out there? Carlos Rodriguez : I think the best way to describe it, that by the way, was all accurate like we're really happy with international, but also in particular, the mid-market, I think we kind of underestimated as usual, there are multiple moving parts. So you had the pandemic at work. And so we were looking at kind of a historical trends and thoughts, there would be some normalization within the mid-market, but we also had forgotten that right before the pandemic, not right before but 12 to 18 months before the pandemic, we completed our migrations onto one single platform, which is our modern Workforce Now platform, huge process improvement initiatives that were led by John Ayala and the team there that really improved the underlying strength of that business, right. So then you get into the pandemic and you get that noise. Now you come out of the pandemic and there's no scientific way to pull all that apart, but it does feel like our mid-market business has a new floor, if you will, or a nut floor is not the right way to describe it, but a new level of retention that's higher than it was before, that's at least right now, the way it looks in our hope going forward, so that's really good news. The other item on the out of business that you're mentioning, which is really more of a down market question, we again our big subscribers to the school of common sense, and it's playing out kind of the way we expected, because if you look at the reported level of bankruptcies from government figures, they're pretty flat, but that really is not the way the small business market works that, everyone declares bankruptcy, like some people get into business and they stop their business and they never declare bankruptcy. So that is a good proxy and it's one indication, but it's not the only one. And so we have seen some normalization in that down market business because of what we call non-controllable losses, right, which would include out of business bankruptcies, all of the above. It's a big enough factor in that segment that it's impossible to believe that it wouldn't normalize, which is why we planned the way we did. The good news is that it hasn't normalized as fast as we thought. And the other part of our business, the controllable losses have performed better than we expected. And so net-net, we are in better shape than we thought, but just because you have the second best retention you've ever had, doesn't mean that it isn't down from the previous year. And so I just wanted to be crystal clear on that because others may have a different perspective on which would defy. I think finance one-one-one theories and so forth because the number of \u2013 the percentage of losses related to the economy and so forth are just significant in the down market. And so when you have this unbelievable tailwind, when you think about the amount of stimulus that was put in with PPP loans and so forth and stimulus checks, remember some of these small businesses are just like consumers, they're one person companies, or five person companies. And when they get a stimulus check, that's like a stimulus check going to their company, that stuff is all coming out of the system and interest rates are going up. It will normalize unfortunately, but you see the outcome net-net for us, which is still incredibly gratifying and way above what we would've expected. Don McGuire : Just to clarify that, that second best comment James was with respect the down market only. Overall, it was an all-time high. James Faucette : Yes, thanks for that. And then so does that \u2013 so should we interpret it then to mean like, as far as that we should still expect some deterioration particularly as that down market normalizes, because that hasn't happened maybe as fast as you thought, but the drivers are still there, whereas on the mid-market you're feeling better that your new platform can actually help prevent or improve that retention versus what you thought. So you kind of have one thing that's permanent and one that's still to happen and net-net, there may be still some deterioration, but not as much as you thought, is that a fair assessment? Carlos Rodriguez : I think that is a fair assessment that you should stand by for further details next quarter for next calendar \u2013 next fiscal year, because I think we gave you enough color. What you just described is exactly what we expect to happen for the fourth quarter and you see the outcome in terms of our overall guidance for retention. But I think what's more important for you guys is I hope is not just next quarter, but the next year. And I think we'll have another several months of information by then. And we have some other businesses, I talked about the HRO business, our SBS business, I mean, there's other business that are frankly outperforming outside of kind of the economic factors and the mid-market business that are outperforming. So it's really not appropriate yet to jump to any conclusions, but I think your general thesis is exactly correct. James Faucette : That's great. Thank you very much, everybody. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I\u2019m pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos Rodriguez : Well, thanks for all of you for joining us today. I hate to end on a down note here, but I think it's important for us to acknowledge, what's happening in Ukraine and express our sympathies for the folks that are in the midst of that conflict. We obviously like everyone else would like to see the violence end. We have very small exposure from a revenue and business standpoint in Russia and Ukraine, but we do have quite a number of associates and a decent sized business in Eastern Europe. And so we would love to see this violence end and certainly not to spread, we've been doing our part along with some of our colleagues and other companies in the humanitarian efforts to provide relief to the people in Ukraine. But what's really been most gratifying to me is not just what been able to do through our foundation and through ADP, but what our associates have done globally kind of reaching into their own pocketbooks to help their fellow global citizens. We increased our match, our matching contribution amounts for associates who wanted to provide to various relief agencies. And we had the largest \u2013 I think reaction we've ever had to any global crisis. And it's obvious why, because when you see the pictures of what's going on and it's truly horrifying. And I mean, for me personally, to see people leaving everything behind and children and families having to flee is personally very painful. So our hearts go out to those folks and we pray that all of the leaders involved can come to some sort of resolution and end of violence. But with that, I will thank you once again for participating with us today. And we look forward to giving you all the information you're looking for fiscal year 2023 on the next earnings call. Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Michelle and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be your conference Operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fourth quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call.  I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. After the speakers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 presentation, we will conduct a question and answer session. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Danyal Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Danyal Hussain : Thank you Michelle, and apologies to everyone for the brief delay. Welcome everyone to ADP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fourth quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call and webcast. Participating today are Carlos Rodriguez, our CEO, Maria Black, our President, and Don McGuire, our CFO.  Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call.  During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these items along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release. Today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.  With that, let me turn it over to Carlos. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you Dany, and thank you everyone for joining our call. We finished our fiscal 2022 with a strong fourth quarter that featured 10% revenue growth and 12% organic constant currency revenue growth. We also delivered 170 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion which helped drive 25% adjusted EPS growth, and for the full fiscal year 2022 we ended up with 10% revenue growth, 90 basis points of margin expansion, 16% adjusted EPS growth, and importantly we achieved record bookings and near record level retention, reflecting our strong position in the HCM market. Let me cover some highlights from the quarter and year before turning it over to Maria and Don for their perspectives. Starting with employer services new business bookings, we had a fantastic Q4 with growth accelerating from the prior quarter, resulting in our largest new business bookings quarter ever. With this strong finish, we were very pleased to have delivered 15 ES bookings growth for the year. Despite several sources of global uncertainty, including the ongoing effect of the pandemic, the conflict in Ukraine, inflation and concerns about global recession, our compelling site of HCM offerings has continued to resonate throughout the market. In total, we sold over $1.7 billion in ES new business bookings in fiscal 2022 and well over $2 billion when including the PEO, marking the first time we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve exceed $2 billion in bookings. Maria will talk more about the growth opportunities ahead, but clearly we are incredibly pleased with what is the best performance by our sales force that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in my 20 years with ADP. Moving on, our full year ES retention of 92.1% was nearly flat versus last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record level of 92.2% as we once again exceeded our expectations in the fourth quarter. Client retention is driven by several factors, including product and service quality, business mix, and macroeconomic factors, and our expectation at the start of fiscal 2022 called for macroeconomic factors like SMB out-of-business rates to drive some normalization in retention towards pre-pandemic levels. We did see some of that play out, but clearly less than anticipated. More importantly, our product and service teams have continued to deliver a best-in-class experience for our clients and particularly so on our modern and scaled platforms. We achieved record client satisfaction levels for the year and we once again set new record levels for retention in several of our businesses, including our midmarket, so although you will hear from Don that we are once again making an assumption for a modest amount of macroeconomic-related normalization and retention in fiscal 2023, we are excited to have delivered such a strong performance in fiscal 2022 and look forward to maintaining our retention rates at these historically high levels. Moving onto the employment picture, our pays per control growth metric was 7% for the quarter and 7% for the year, reflecting a persistently strong demand environment for labor among our clients that has continued to exceed our expectations. This growth has served as a testament to the resilience of our clients, and although we expect pays per control growth will naturally slow in coming quarters, employment conditions today remain strong with our client data suggesting that near term demand for labor remains healthy. Finally, our PEO business delivered another great quarter as it wrapped up a strong year. We had average worksite employee growth of 14% in Q4 and 15% for the year, and we were thrilled to have crossed the 700,000 worksite employee mark this quarter. As you know, I joined ADP two decades ago when ADP entered the PEO market through an acquisition, and as bullish as I was about the PEO industry back then, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure I could have anticipated we would be here 20 years later still growing at this combination of pace and scale, but the ADP TotalSource team continues to deliver a great platform, great service and a great benefit experience for our PEO clients and there is plenty of opportunity for us in the years ahead to serve even more businesses. Taking a step back, fiscal 2022 was unique in a number of ways. We experienced strong demand with over $2 billion in worldwide new business bookings and near record level retention which together drove us to surpass 990,000 clients at year end, putting us on track to exceed a million clients any day now. At the same time, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had to manage this growth and volume with prudent headcount growth, given tight labor conditions. The way we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been able to do is through efficiencies, of course, but also through plain hard work by our associates, and for that, I thank them for their efforts and for coming through for our clients once again. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll now turn it over to Maria. Maria Black : Thank you Carlos. With fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922 behind us, I want to take this opportunity to review where we stand on some key initiatives and provide an update on where we are heading in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923. At the core of our client experience is their interaction with our platform, and one product initiative we had talked about throughout fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922 is our new unified user experience, which was designed to be more action-oriented and contextual and to move us from transaction-oriented applications to experience-oriented applications; in other words, more intuitive, better looking, faster, and more consistent across our solution. To achieve this, we have applied a research-driven approach informed by the data and insights we have gained in working with our nearly 1 million clients. Our focus has been to listen to our clients, learn from them, and utilize their input to design the best experience. In fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922, we moved hundreds of thousands of clients over to this new user experience, including our clients on RUN, IHCM and next-gen HCM, as well as over 20,000 Workforce Now clients. We also moved the ADP mobile app over to the new UX. Feedback so far has been extremely positive and in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923, we plan to expand this rollout further to remaining Workforce Now clients as well as to additional modules and experiences within our key platforms. Workforce Now in particular has been exciting for us for a few reasons beyond user experience. First is its growing traction in the U.S. enterprise market. Just this quarter, ADP was rated for the first time an overall customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choice provider in Gardner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s annual Voice of the Customer Study. This was the highest tier possible and was based on perspectives from end users with 1,000 or more employees and is a reflection of our continued momentum in selling Workforce Now to the lower end of the U.S. up market these past few years. This momentum builds on the already strong presence and traction Workforce Now has had in the U.S. midmarket in the HRO space and in Canada, all places where it is highly differentiated. Second is the continued roll-out of our next-gen payroll engine to a growing portion of our new Workforce Now clients. Our next-gen payroll engine not only benefits from having a global native and public cloud architecture but also empowers our platforms, like Workforce Now, to offer a better product experience and enables us to offer better service. We are incredibly excited for our payroll engine to continue to scale up to larger and more complex Workforce Now clients over the coming quarters. Finally, with talent and engagement an increasingly important aspect of the HCM suite, we continue to focus on our ability to help employers better connect with their employees. This quarter, we will launch a new offering that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re calling Voice of the Employee, a robust employee survey and listening tool which leverages survey instruments from the ADP Research Institute to offer clients a way to seamlessly capture employee sentiment across the employee life cycle. One of the things I love about this solution is that it was born out of elevated client employee engagement our return to work workplace solutions have been able to drive, and it reflects the ability of our global product team to quickly identify an opportunity and develop a solution to meet a need in the market. Moving on, we made some exciting enhancements to the Wisely program this quarter. Most notably, we now offer Wisely self enrollment with full digital wallet capabilities for Apple and Google Pay, thereby allowing employees to instantly receive and start using their Wisely account without support from their employer and without having to wait for a physical card. We also expanded our earned wage access solution by offering a seamless one app solution for Wisely members through a deeper integration with one of our key partners. The offering enables employees to receive a portion of their earned wages prior to payday, and most importantly is free for employees who use Wisely.  With these enhancements and more on the horizon, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re incredibly excited about the growth prospects for Wisely and look forward to taking it from over 1.5 million active members today to an even larger portion of our U.S. payroll base over the coming years. During fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922, we also highlighted the strength of our retirement services business, a key component of our HCM suite. We offer record keeping services, provide unbiased independent advisory services, and give our clients, their employees and financial advisors access to over 10,000 investment options from over 300 investment managers seamlessly integrated with our key platform and with the ADP mobile app. With over 125,000 retirement plan clients leveraging solutions, including 401-K, SIMPLE and SEP plans, we are proud of our scale today but even more excited about the significant opportunity in the market as we look to expand our market share within and beyond our payroll base of clients. Fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922 was an incredibly strong year for our retirement services business and we are looking forward to another strong year.  Finally, our next-gen HCM solution is getting closer to a broader rollout as we continue building on the implementation capacity for our pipeline of sold clients, as we shared at last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investor day. While we are excited about all of these product enhancements and others too, products only drive growth when our sales and marketing organization can match it to a buyer and translate it into new business bookings, and to that end, we are excited about our sales and marketing momentum and the continued investments we have planned to drive growth this year. First, the product improvements I just mentioned, as well as many others, are all intended to drive higher win rates, an expanded breadth of offerings or higher price realization, and we fully expect our sales force to continue capitalizing on these opportunities. Second, we are making continued investment in both digital and traditional marketing into our brands and into our broad and growing partnership network. Third, we are excited to have invested at year end in sales headcount and are stepping into the new year with hundreds of additional quota carriers, and we expect to be able to grow our average sales headcount in the mid single digit range over fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923. Continued execution on our product and our sales and marketing strategy is ultimately designed to drive sustainable growth, and for fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923 we expect to drive ES bookings growth of 6% to 9% bracketing around our medium term target of 7% to 8% from investor day. Growth is a priority for us, and we look forward to continuing to update you on our progress. Now over to Don. Don McGuire : Thank you Maria, and good morning everyone.  Our Q4 represented a strong close to the year with 10% revenue growth on a reported basis and 12% growth on an organic constant currency basis, ahead of our expectations despite higher than expected FX headwinds from a strengthening dollar. Our adjusted EBIT margin was up 170 basis points, about in line with our expectations as leverage from strong revenue growth overcame higher selling expenses, PEO pass throughs, and growth investments like the sales headcount growth Maria just mentioned, and our robust revenue and margin performance drove 25% adjusted EPS growth for the quarter, supported by our ongoing return of cash to our investors via share repurchases. For the full year, revenue landed at 10% growth. We delivered 90 basis points of margin expansion, offsetting a few different sources of incremental expense over the course of the year, and adjusted EPS grew to $7.01, up about 16%.  For our employer services segment, revenues in the quarter increased 8% on a reported basis and 9% on an organic constant currency basis. The stronger than expected revenue growth was a function of continued outperformance on key metrics like retention and pays per control, and our ES margin increase of 140 basis points was a bit lower than previously planned as a result of growing headcount faster than previously anticipated. For the full year, our ES revenues grew 8% on a reported basis and our ES margin increased 110 basis points. For our PEO, revenue in the quarter grew 16%, accelerating slightly from Q3. Average worksite employees increased 14% on a year-over-year basis to 704,000 as bookings, retention, and same store pays all continued to perform well. PEO margin was up 260 basis points in the quarter due in large part to favorable workers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 compensation reserve adjustments. For the full year, our PEO revenues and average worksite employees both grew 15%, at the high end of our guidance ranges, and our margin expanded 80 basis points.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll now turn to our outlook for fiscal 2023, beginning with some overall remarks. We have on the one hand an inflationary environment that is creating upward pressure on our expense base, and at the same time we recognize there is clearly concern about a potential upcoming global recession, or that we perhaps are already in one. On the other hand, our momentum entering fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923 is strong and there are no obvious signs of near term strength, and if the market\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forecast of higher interest rates holds, we are positioned to benefit from a continued rebound in interest income. Our focus for now will be to continue executing on our strategy, and to that end, we have been and will continue to be making investments in headcount where we perhaps didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get a chance to last year in a tight labor market, and we also expect to deliver growth that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at or above our medium term annual objectives shared at the November \u00e2\u0080\u009921 investor day. Onto the numbers, beginning with ES segment revenues, we expect growth of 6% to 8% driven by the following key assumptions. First, we expect our ES new business bookings growth to be 6% to 9%, which Maria covered. For ES retention, we finished the year at 92.1%, a touch below last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record level, and we believe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prudent to anticipate some further normalization of business levels in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923 even while we maintain record retention levels in some of our other business units. Our initial assumption is for a decline of 25 to 50 basis points in ES retention for the year. For pays per control, with employment back near pre-pandemic levels, we anticipate a return to a more typical 2% to 3% growth range. We normally talk about price as contributing 50 basis points to our ES growth rate, but we expect that benefit to be around 100 to 150 basis points this year.  For client funds interest revenue, we expect higher overnight interest rates and higher repurchase rates on maturing securities should combine with our continued balance growth to drive interest income up nicely. Our short funds portfolio, which is invested in overnight securities, will benefit assuming the Federal Open Market Committee increases the Fed funds rate over the course of this fiscal year, and our client extended and long portfolios will benefit as we reinvest maturing securities at an expected rate of about 3.3%. Between those two drivers, we expect average yield to increase from 1.4% in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922 to 2.2% in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923.  We expect our client funds balances to grow 4% to 6%, supported by growth in clients, pays per control, and wages, and this is on top of a very robust 19% growth we experienced last year. Putting those together, we expect our client funds interest revenue to increase from $452 million in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922 to a range of $720 million to $740 million in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923.  Meanwhile, the net impact from our client fund strategy will increase by a bit less, from $475 million in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922 to a range of $675 million to $695 million in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923, and as a reminder, this is the number that impacts our adjusted EBIT. The slightly lower growth here is due to the expected increase in short term borrowing costs which track the Feds fund rate. This borrowing enables us to ladder our portfolio and invest further out on the yield curve than we otherwise would. As we gradually reinvest our maturing securities, this gap between client funds revenue and the net impact from our client fund strategy should reverse and again become positive. Back to the ES revenue outlook, one more factor to consider is FX headwinds. Clearly with the year-over-year parity the dollar with a weaker pound and with about 20% of our ES segment revenue being generated outside the U.S., we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re factoring in a fair amount of FX headwind for fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923 of well over 1%. For our ES margin, we expect an increase of 175 to 200 basis points.  This coming year, our expense base will be increasing more than it does in a typical year, in part due to inflationary pressure on our overall wages and in part due to headcount growth, some of which we did late in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922 and some of which we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re planning for fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923, but because our margins are benefiting from strong revenue growth outlook, including growth in client funds interest revenue, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pleased to be able to guide to this strong ES margin outlook. Moving onto the PEO segment, we expect PEO revenues and PEO revenues excluding zero margin pass through to grow 10% to 12%. The primary driver for our PEO revenue growth is our outlook for average worksite employee growth of 8% to 10%. That would represent a bit of a deceleration from last year, but of course we are contemplating much less contribution from same store pays per control in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923 compared to fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922. This 8% to 10% growth compares to the high single digit target that we outlined at the investor day in November. We expect our PEO margin to be down 25 to up 25 basis points in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923 compared to a strong margin result in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922. Adding it all up, our consolidated revenue outlook is for 7% to 9% growth in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923 and our adjusted EBIT margin outlook is for expansion of 100 to 125 basis points. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923 to increase slightly to about 23%, and we expect adjusted EPS growth of 13% to 16% supported by buybacks.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make one comment on cadence - because we expect year-over-year headcount growth to be more significant early in the year and because the benefit from client funds interest will build as the year progresses, we expect adjusted EBIT margins to be down about 50 basis points in Q1 but then build steadily over the rest of the year. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll now turn it back to Michelle for Q&A. Operator :  Our first question comes from Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Your line is open. Bryan Bergin : Hi, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to start with a demand question. Can you just talk about what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen across client size as it relates to demand environment? I heard the continued optimism in the mid market. Can you talk a bit more about up market, down market, international, and then just give us a sense of booking cadence. It sounds like it accelerated through 4Q. Have you seen any change in pace as you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gone through the first couple weeks here in July? Maria Black : Yes, absolutely Bryan. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m happy to comment on both pieces. With respect to the overall strength that we saw in new business bookings both for the full year fiscal - very, very proud of the remarkable results, but for full year as well as the fourth quarter, and the strength was really broad-based. There was solid performance across each one of our markets. I think a few callouts that I would give, you highlighted the mid market. The mid market does continue to perform. We saw strength in our HRO offerings even beyond the PEO. The HRO was a strength for us. I know I mentioned it in the prepared remarks, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be remiss if I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mention retirement services again. We also saw results in Canada, which was fantastic to see as Canada definitely was impacted a bit more with the longer lockdowns from a pandemic perspective, and then I continue to highlight quarter after quarter the strength that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing in our down market and our RUN offer, so felt very pleased with the RUN. Then last but not least, on the international front, our international business had a tremendous year, so very confident in the results, very proud of the work of the sales organization. As we think about the demand environment right now, you asked about how did it progress throughout the quarter and how do we feel sitting here a few weeks into July. I suppose I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily comment on in quarter, but what I can comment on is we did see the results accelerate throughout the quarter, so while there was some macroeconomic things happening in the world, our demand actually accelerated as we closed out the quarter, so we saw significant strength specifically in the month of June - in fact, June was a record month for us ever, as was the quarter and as was the year, as mentioned.  We feel good about the demand environment and the acceleration we saw throughout the quarter, and thank you for the questions. Bryan Bergin : Okay, and then just a follow-up on margins. If things do slow down, can you just talk about the levers you have to insulate EBIT margins? It sounds like they have taken a healthy amount of resource additions. Can you talk about where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making those across the organization and then where you might have some discretion to throttle investment, should things slow down? Don McGuire : Yes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very good question, so thank you for the question. I think as I mentioned in the remarks and the materials that we distributed, we were able to get our sales organization a little bit more than fully staffed going into the fourth quarter, and that makes us feel really good about the opportunity to step off into \u00e2\u0080\u009923 with a fully staffed team, which is something that, as we mentioned in prior quarters, was a little bit more difficult to do during \u00e2\u0080\u009922, so I think we feel really good about where we are with staffing particularly on the sales side. I would also say that, just following the business model that we have, if you look at the record sales we had particularly late in the fourth quarter, we need to make sure that we have fully staffed implementation resources to get those bookings generating revenue as quickly as they can, so we will be focused on that, and then of course just following through to the year-end process, need to make sure we can service all those additional clients as that time comes upon us in late December-January-February. We can do all those things.  On the other hand, as I referenced and as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing in the media and elsewhere, everywhere is talk about a recession potentially coming, are we in one, etc. We still do have flexibility of course, and we can certainly temper the addition of headcount and temper our costs more generally should we think that that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s necessary, if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as a result of changes in the macro environment, so I think we still have lots of levers and I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve shown historically that we are able to navigate those waters pretty adeptly should that kind of situation arise. Bryan Bergin : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Kevin McVeigh : Great, thanks so much, and congratulations on the results. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if this will be for Carlos or whomever, but it feels like the retention step-up is clearly a little more structural, just given the recent trends in \u00e2\u0080\u009922 into \u00e2\u0080\u009923. Is that a function of the next-gen payroll engine or just where are you seeing that success, because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clearly been a super, super outcome post COVID. I think part of our focus is whether or not that starts to normalize or not, but it feels like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at a structurally higher level. Carlos Rodriguez : There probably are some structural factors just because we can see, obviously, where the retention is stronger, and I think as we mentioned, some of the macroeconomic readjustment that we expected in a down market, we saw some of it, just not as much as we expected. But if talk of recession is correct and  business and bankruptcies and so forth probably will come back to some kind of normal level, which is why, as Don mentioned in his remarks, we once again plan for a slight decrease in retention in \u00e2\u0080\u009923, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really mainly in a down market in terms of the mix that it represents--the total represents of the mix, because everywhere else we really see some reasonable, what appear to be structural improvements. I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really next-gen payroll because you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really going to see that, the impact of that on sales and market share and so forth in the next couple of years because the majority of our clients are still not enjoying, I think, the benefits, even though over time they will of next-gen payroll, so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really not--I just want to make I was clear on that, that that is not what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s causing the retention improvements.  But one thing I would point out is--I know this is a broken record, but we made this big transition from multiple platforms onto one in a down market 10 years ago, or a little bit more than that, and then more recently we went through a multi-year effort, which was painful to do that in the mid market. We have other things going on, like new UX and next-gen payroll, that those migrations and those consolidations in and of themselves have created some real structural tailwinds, I think, in terms of service, NPS, and ultimately on the retention standpoint. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a much more--an easier environment for our own folks to operate in, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easier for us to invest in less platforms versus more platforms. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a much better environment. As you know, we still have work to do in the up market, so there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still opportunity there, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still some opportunity in employer services international as well, but we think these structural tailwinds that first helped us in the down market despite the macro, right, because the macro is really a cyclical issue, but overall excluding cycles, our retention in a down market is up--I said this before, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hundreds of basis points higher than it was 10 to 15 years ago, and now the mid market is at record levels and the NPS scores continue to be at record levels, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think we anticipate that going back down. If anything, we see more opportunity there in the mid market, and our plan would be to continue to do that throughout other parts of ADP to add more structural tailwinds to our retention. Kevin McVeigh : Super helpful. Then maybe this is for Don, it looks like the margin guidance, like 100, 125 basis points up from 90, given the leverage and float in pricing, it seems like really nice outcome on the pricing side. Is the offset kind of the cost inflation, and where is the cost inflation in the model in \u00e2\u0080\u009923 relative to where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been historically? Don McGuire : Yes, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good observation. I think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a few things driving it. Of course, we talked about more price than we historically have been able to take, and of course we do have the tailwinds, if you will, from the client fund interest, so. Certainly we need to remember that the reason we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting our interest rates is that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in a higher inflationary environment, so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s driving more cost base in wages. The other aspect is that we have called out, and we typically haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t called out FX in the past, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve certainly seen, I think what we would refer to as pretty dramatic changes in FX headwinds in the fourth quarter compared to what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in typical years, and so we thought that was important to call out. With 20% of our ES revenue being outside of the U.S. and denominated in Canadian dollars, euros, sterling, Australian dollars for that matter, I think all the currencies are essentially down. When you put all that stuff together, it certainly results in a little bit less at the top line dropping through to margins, so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been our focus. The other thing I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say is that we do have a little bit of conservatism as we look to the back half. We have to take into account all the things we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re reading about and seeing and making sure that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking hard about how to prepare should something happen in the back half of the year, so I think those are the primary drivers, to answer your question. Carlos Rodriguez : And if I could add one thing, because you mentioned also price, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a big topic. I know for a lot of companies, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of questions about it, and I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important for you to understand strategically at a very high level, regardless of how it flows into the numbers and so forth, our view on price, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said it for a couple of quarters now, is to kind of keep up with inflation, so I want to make sure it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very clear that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not achieving our margin improvements for doing anything that would be unusual, because I think there might be some companies that are trying to make up revenue gaps or margin gaps with price because there is, quote-unquote, cover out there to do that. But I think when you do that, and I think Don has mentioned this before, that we operate in a competitive environment and we look at what competitors are doing and we look at what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in the world, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re long term thinkers here, so you should assume that our price increases were in line with what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening with inflationary costs and not anything more than that, and not materially less than that. Kevin McVeigh : You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been very consistent on that. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Bryan Keane : Hi guys, good morning, and congrats on the numbers. I guess my question is looking at the midterm outlook for employer services back in November, I think we talked about a 6% growth rate, and you guys are going to be trending above that, 6% to 8%. With the strength in bookings growing over 15%, I just wonder if maybe the midterm outlook was a little low compared to what structurally is going on in the business model, that potentially the growth rate is faster than the 6% outlook that you gave over midterm. Carlos Rodriguez : Well, I hope so. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll let Don comment in a moment, but again, just because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been doing this for a long time, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get it out of my mind. The way the recurring revenue model kind of works is we love the 15%, and what you just described really comes through in the numbers. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the difference between our bookings and our losses--our strong retention and our strong bookings, that the net of that contributed more to employer services revenue than ever seen in my tenure as CEO, and that is what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s led to the deceleration you just described in ES revenue, so that net new business growth is really the way to grow the top line. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other factors in there, like pays per control, client funds interest, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the core of the business and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really happy with that. The challenge, of course, is that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not forecasting 15% bookings growth again next year, so I would just caution you, too. Now, the good news is that that increase in net new business is in our run rate now, and so we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to grow by as much the next year in terms of that net new business to further accelerate our revenue growth, but I would just caution you in terms of if you do that kind of math, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to accelerate the revenue growth rate of this company. We just did it and it takes a combination of better retention and higher starts, higher sales and new business starting in the upcoming year, and that 15% really makes it huge difference. But you can see from our guidance that that is not our expectation next year in terms of bookings, and so you will experience hopefully additional acceleration of revenue growth in ES, but not by as much as you had from \u00e2\u0080\u009922 to \u00e2\u0080\u009923. Notwithstanding the fact that, remember, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other things in there, moving parts like pays per control, client funds interest and so forth, some of which will give us tailwinds, some of which may be headwinds. Don McGuire : Yes, so Carlos covered off all the main drivers there. Of course, I think just once again I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d go back and mention the FX headwinds we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re experiencing. I think when you add that into the mix, I think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d probably get to a place where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re landing and what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re anticipating guiding to for \u00e2\u0080\u009923. Bryan Keane : Got it, got it. Then let me ask you another popular question that everybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s getting, is just how the model might be different now versus previous recessions, just thinking about the resilience potential in the ADP model. Carlos Rodriguez : I mean, Don again has, I think, a couple points he could probably make, but I would say as usual, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably some puts and takes. I mean, obviously I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be a CEO if I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say I think our model is better now than it was before, even though I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been through a couple cycles here myself, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m criticizing anything other than myself if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m saying that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better than it was before. But we just talked about the structural retention level, so even if we have a little bit of a drag in the down market, and by the way, the down market is a larger percent of our overall business than it was 10, 20 years ago, but still it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s structurally higher by several hundred basis points in and of itself, so even if it goes down a little bit and is a little bit bigger part of our mix, I think our retention is just going to hold up better, I would predict, in terms of--you know, depending obviously on the severity of the recession, so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a huge help because the bigger--obviously the portion of the revenues that you retain each year, the less dependency you have on bookings in a recession, which tends to be the most sensitive.  Historically when you look at GDP growth and all of our metrics besides pays per control, bookings is something that can be challenging in a severe recession, which to reiterate, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see. We read the same things everyone else reads and we know that Fed tightening will lead to a slower economic growth, but we really can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see it in our numbers. Our pays per control number in the fourth quarter was as strong as it was the whole year. When you look at the monthly initial unemployment claims, you look at the room that still is there in labor force participation, you look at the number of job openings in comparison to where it was historically, I just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see it. There clearly are pockets that are happening. I think as part of readjustments because of COVID that are kind of confusing the landscape and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clearly some kind of slowdown underway because it just happens when you have Fed tightening, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not happening in the labor market, at least not yet. Bryan Keane : Great, thanks for the color. Operator : Our next question comes from Tien-tsing Huang with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Tien- tsing Huang : Thank you so much. Really strong sales. I was just trying to think about attribution, the strength and how you would rank the factors there between better product set that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more relevant or better just productivity, expanded sales force, the cycle, or particular things around outsourcing taking over versus software. Any interesting observations on your side, Carlos or Maria? Maria Black : Yes, thank you. Definitely tremendous strength that we saw. I think I called out a few areas. Definitely the strength that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing in our up market continues to excite us for the future. I think you asked about the attribution of strength, and I think it really was broad-based across the business, but I think from an execution standpoint, it really comes down to the execution of our sales organization and how they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been able to go to market, candidly, really over the last two years as it relates to navigating this evolving environment, but more specifically providing value to our clients in a more meaningful way, and we really have seen that evolve over this past year as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been really across each one of the segments, helping our clients navigate, as I mentioned, the evolving environment inclusive all the legislative changes. I think there is value we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re bringing. I think the strong execution in general across the sales organization and leveraging the entire ecosystem to bring that strength, right, which is everything from our marketing investments, our brand investments, I spoke earlier to the headcount investments, and so all of this together, I think has lent itself to tremendous execution and strength as it relates to the overall performance. Carlos Rodriguez : The only thing I would add to that is Maria and I have been talking for the last 18 months about how--you know, one of the most important things for our sales organization was really to get productivity at the quota carrier level back to and then exceed from a trend line standpoint where it was, right, so when you think about whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s GDP trend or price trends or anything like that, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to get back to where you were and then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to get back on that same trend line, otherwise you leave a lot of money on the table, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the economy or ADP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revenue and bookings growth.  From an attribution standpoint, again this--I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important for you to understand this color. We had unbelievable productivity growth, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why I said that this is the best performance I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen by our sales force. Clearly some of it is because we were in recovery mode, but sales forces naturally generally have--not that I know, because I was never a sales person, but I guess I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been around long enough to be hopefully an honorary member, but when you tell a sales force, okay, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to grow--we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to grow our headcount by a few percentage points and then we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to grow our productivity two or three percentage points, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in a typical year, right, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard in a typical year. When you tell a sales force, you have to grow your productivity close to 20%, even though it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because it went down 20%, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s freaking hard to do, very hard to do psychologically. Anybody who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in sales, I think understands that, and so these percentage growth numbers that we have and the productivity growth numbers that we have, honestly, are incredibly just gratifying, because I really thought this was going to be hard. I was, of course, keeping my poker face on and just telling everybody, we have to do it, we have to do it, and we did it, so most of this growth came from productivity and not from headcount because, as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked about, we actually had some challenges up until the fourth quarter in terms of achieving our headcount objectives, not by lack of trying, by the way, and not because we were trying to save money, because we were doing everything we could and it was just a difficult labor market. The good news is in the fourth quarter, as Maria has mentioned, we really did quite well and are in a great position headcount-wise now, but the \u00e2\u0080\u009922 story is all about productivity, and that is an unbelievable accomplishment for our sales force, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s across the board. Maria Black : It is, and just to provide some actual numbers to that, so we reported $1.7 billion in employer services bookings - that is a record, as mentioned, and it does exceed the other record which was pre-pandemic in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009919 at $1.6 billion, and so that really in the end speaks to some of this additional productivity , if you will. But Carlos is spot on - we did initially tell the sales force people, we will add headcount and you have to grow faster, but in the end we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t add the headcount and they grew that much faster, which is why I am very bullish and excited as we step into the fiscal year with more sellers, more active quota carriers to really couple this strength that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had in productivity with now finally more sellers to go get after it. Tien- tsing Huang : That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great. It must be gratifying for sure. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll stop there with that question. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Your line is open. Dan Dolev : Hey guys. Really nice results. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m very happy to see the strength in the enterprise that you called out . Can you maybe tell us, like--I know you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t parse out the growth between--in ES, but if you did, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love to hear it in terms of the different sub-verticals. But on the bigger picture, can you tell us what types of firms--basically, are you now regaining share in some of those lower end of the large enterprise and sort of what size of firm it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming from and all these conversations . Thank you. Carlos Rodriguez : Yes, I think you mentioned--we were having a little trouble catching the entire question, so maybe I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try to give a little bit of color and maybe you can repeat again, or ask us--ask the question again. But I think you said something about the lower end of the enterprise space and where the strength in sales was coming from, etc. I think just to repeat what Maria said, I think it is across the board, but that is one--the reason I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m picking up on it, this is a really good news story for us, so our Workforce Now platform--you know, we made the strategic decision two or three years ago, it makes sense because it fits well in the lower end of the enterprise space, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really been a home run for us there. Against certain competitors, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really very, very effective, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re selling a lot of units in that lower end of the up market space for us. As we continue with the rollout of next-gen HCM, which is really intended for further up market and eventually for global, in the meantime we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really having a lot of success in the lower end of the up market with our Workforce Now platform. If you want to maybe repeat your question one more time, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give it another try. Dan Dolev : No, I think that sort of answered the question. I wanted to know, and I apologize you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hear me before, I wanted to know how the conversations are--you know, how the conversations are different today when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re with those clients versus, say, three years ago, because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure there has been a tremendous change given the results. Maria Black : There has been a tremendous--it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good observation, there has been tremendous change. I think Carlos hit the nail on the head - in the lower end of the up market, one of the reasons we cited the award and recognition we recently received from Gardner because the conversation around our offering, our Workforce Now in that lower end, is definitely resonating for several reasons. One is it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a best-in-class product, as Gardner even acknowledges and the users that were surveyed for that award, but moreover, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also the speed by which we can execute and really take these enterprise customers and turn them into active clients, and so meeting a lot of different needs from a product perspective, from a timeline perspective. I think in the upper end of the market, certainly the conversation over the last three years has evolved. A big piece of that conversation is the global discussion and our ability to talk to much larger U.S. enterprise customers and other enterprise customers across the globe around our multi-country offerings and how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking about--how they are thinking about their strategic direction on HCM on the global front. I think the conversation continues to evolve on both ends of the spectrum of the up market, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re certainly in a position to have very formidable conversations and transformation discussions with our clients in that space. Dan Dolev : Great, thank you, and excellent results as always. Maria Black : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open. Mark Marcon : Hey, good morning Carlos, Maria and Don. Great to see all of the years of hard work really pay off here this year, so congratulations on the results. Wondering with regards to the new bookings - I mean, $2 billion in total, $1.7 billion in ES, how much of that is split between new logos relative to up-sells, and how would you characterize your expectations on that front for the coming year? Maria Black : Thanks Mark, and thank you for acknowledging the strong performance in bookings. There is really no news to report here. I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve cited it for years - really, the split between new logos and client business really remains at that 50%, kind of 50/50 going forward, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really what we expect heading into fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923. Mark Marcon : Great, and then with regards to the forecast, Don, you gave us a bit of a cadence sense for margin. How would you characterize it for revenue, and specifically what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m interested in is you did mention the interest on client funds is going to be back end loaded, but at the same time, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got pays per control being modeled up 2% to 3%, even though people are starting to call for a potential recession and potentially a decline in employment, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m wondering how are you thinking about that part of the model and are there any things that you would call out with regards to just revenue trends as we build out the models for the coming year? Don McGuire : Yes, so Mark, just going back to the first part of your question, you mentioned the deceleration of margin that I mentioned, and of course we talked about the increase in sales headcount specifically because it is meaningful in quarter one of this year, in quarter one of \u00e2\u0080\u009922, so we do think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to have a bit of a drag. There are, of course, some other factors - general inflation, general etc., and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken price--Carlos described and took you through our price thinking, which is pretty consistent to what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve discussed over the last number of quarters, so we do expect to see a little bit of deterioration in margin percentage through the first quarter, and I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s understood. Then as interest rates continue to--or as interest rates go higher and as we have the opportunity, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to see higher client fund interest for the last three quarters of the year, but overall we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re kind of looking at pretty even top line revenue quarter by quarter through the balance of the year. No big changes at all in terms of growth rates quarter by quarter through \u00e2\u0080\u009923 compared to \u00e2\u0080\u009922, so if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re modeling growth, you can feel be comfortable to model consistent growth across the top lines quarter by quarter. Carlos Rodriguez : And that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that you should model, or that we modeled everything consistently throughout the quarter, so--because I do have to make a comment on your point that it sounded like you thought we were being aggressive, which would not be typical of us to model 2% to 3% pays per control when everyone is thinking there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be a recession. I would tell you that the fourth quarter, you saw what our pays per control growth was, and I can tell you that we have visibility into July and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to believe that for the whole year, it would be less than 2% to 3%, but then you can assume that if, for example, the first couple of months at least, since we have some visibility of that already, are in the 6% to 7% range, because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re kind of exiting, and you can do the math, right, so you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re probably--this is just to give you color in terms of what some of our assumptions are in our operating plan, because I think Don mentioned maybe a bit of conservatism on the back half. We probably have reasonable continuation of trends, because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the way trends go, on pays per control in the first half, and then you would probably expect the second half of the year to have little to no pays per control growth, or somewhere in that neighborhood.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also hard for us to model a big negative growth on pays per control just because of all the factors we mentioned in the labor market. That doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen in \u00e2\u0080\u009924 or late in \u00e2\u0080\u009923, or at some point in history, but it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem likely over the course of our fiscal year. But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re clearly expecting some slowdown in the second half. Mark Marcon : Carlos, you read my mind in terms of just the way I was thinking about the characterization and then thinking, okay, this is probably what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking in terms of the way it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to unfold, so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s directly in line. Can I just ask one more question? On Workforce Now, would you expect next-gen payroll, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the expectation in terms of the number of clients that would have next-gen payroll within the Workforce Now contingent by the end of the year? Carlos Rodriguez : In terms of new business bookings, because obviously--we just want to make sure we answer the question correctly. It will only affect--obviously we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not even talking about migrations yet, even though at some point that will happen-- Mark Marcon : That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I was asking. Are we going to do any migrations over the course of this year? Carlos Rodriguez : No. Mark Marcon : Okay, great. Thank you and congrats again. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi there. Thanks for taking my question today. I wanted to ask if you are seeing or expect to see any divergence in the kind of hiring or macro--hiring environment or macro impact between the U.S. and Europe. I guess the broader question is, does your guidance assume a tougher environment in Europe relative to the U.S. or something similar? Carlos Rodriguez : Don probably has the details, but I can give you some high level color. Pays per control growth--I know you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not asking about historical, but as we gather the data, I just want to tell you that pays per control growth is very strong in employer services international as well, and part of that, of course, is because of what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re coming off of, right, which were these lockdowns and these high unemployment rates across the globe. I would say international has performed similarly, but it is safe to assume that we see probably challenges given what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in the macro environment with energy costs and the war and so forth in our international business. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, Don, if you have-- Don McGuire : No Carlos, I think those points are valid. Certainly what happens with energy on the continent in particular is going to have some impacts on the results, but beyond that--this is a little bit of the conundrum that we talked about earlier, about where we are versus what people are talking about. So as much as everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s predicting a recession, etc., unemployment rates in the euro zone are at 6.1%, which is an all-time low. Unemployment rates in Canada are as low as they were even before I started working, in 1974. Unemployment rates in Australia are at a 50-year low, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got this situation where there seems to be a lot of employment yet all this risk and worry about recession.  To come back to your question, are we a little bit more concerned about what could happen in EMEA in particular as a result of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on with current prices, etc.? A little bit more concerned, yes. Did we think about that when we put our plans together? To some extent, yes. Carlos Rodriguez : Don, you should point out that you started working in 1974 when you were 12 years old. Don McGuire : Well, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say . Ramsey El-Assal: That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very helpful. A follow-up question, just update us on M&A, capital allocation. Are you shifting your approach at all? Are you seeing incremental opportunity out there given the turmoil with valuations in the marketplace, potential acquisition targets, or is it just sort of steady as she goes in terms of no change? Don McGuire : Yes, I think for now, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty much steady as she goes. I mean, certainly you can see the valuations have dropped across the board. Things that were really expensive in January are still just expensive. Things are still expensive, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come down off of historic highs, so there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not exactly what I would call a bunch of bargains out there. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also not a lot of people who are coming forward looking to sell their properties because prices are down, so I would say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s steady as she goes and we will continue to do what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done and look for things that work for us strategically, look for adjacencies that make sense should they arise. But really, steady as she goes, really no change to our overall policy. Ramsey El-Assal: Great, thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Togut : Thank you, good morning. Don, you called out a 260 basis point margin increase in PEO year-over-year, in part driven by a favorable workers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 compensation reserve adjustment. How much was that adjustment, and how should we think about this item for fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923? Don McGuire : I guess the short answer is we get adjustments on a regular basis, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been favorable for us. We look at the workers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 compensation experience over a number of years and we get external third parties to do an assessment as to whether or not it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appropriate to book any of those adjustments, and this year we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been fortunate. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t typically forecast those numbers in any great detail simply because we do have to rely on the experience rating that the insurance companies bring to us, and so without trying to disclose exactly what the numbers were, I would say they were favorable and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to wait as the months go by to see what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to happen in \u00e2\u0080\u009923. Carlos Rodriguez : We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re disclosing it in our 10-K, so we can-- Danyal Hussain : Yes, it was $40 million for the quarter, David, in the K, and that compares to last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about $5 million. Most of that was as we headed into the quarter in the forecast and guidance, so it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a big departure from what we had expected. Carlos Rodriguez : But I think what Don was trying to say, though, about \u00e2\u0080\u009923 is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clearly a headwind, right, so as we--as you do your modeling and you think about margins, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a headwind not because there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an operating performance issue or whatnot, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just because we had a big benefit in \u00e2\u0080\u009922 and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not planning for a big benefit in \u00e2\u0080\u009923, although we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re always hopeful that we will get some benefit. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historically been our experience, is that we do get some critical reserve release. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably not as big in \u00e2\u0080\u009923 as in \u00e2\u0080\u009922, but it might not be as big a headwind as it appears now, just because of the numbers. David Togut : Appreciate that. Just as a quick follow-up, Don, in the guidance you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve given for extended investment strategy, client fund interest to be up about $200 million to $220 million year-over-year in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923, how should we think about the incremental margin on that additional revenue? Are you applying additional expenses against it or should we think about it flowing through at some set margin? Don McGuire : Yes, so I think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other things going on, of course. We mentioned the inflationary environment, which is why have the higher interest rates. We mentioned the FX headwinds we have, so all things in, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still expecting--we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still very happy and very proud of the operating margin improvements we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting and we think we still have good opportunity for margin improvements ex-client fund interest going forward. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say that right now, our expectations are for a pretty balanced incremental margin from both of those factors, so we are of course, as we mentioned--you know, we are spending some more money, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re investing in sales headcount, we have higher costs as a result of inflation, some of it is offset by price, but we are letting a substantial amount fall to the bottom line but we are obviously in this for the long term, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take the opportunity to invest in the business and make sure that we have the right balance between margin growth and preparing ourselves for continued success in the future years. Carlos Rodriguez : But I think that stream of revenue, we would generally see it as 100% margin, just to be completely clear. If that  your question, do we apply expenses against those revenues, the answer is I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve--it felt like a trick question because you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve known us for a long time and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been clear for a long--like, on the way down, we always say it 100% hurts us, right, because there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really no expenses that go away when that interest income goes away, so likewise we would want to be transparent and acknowledge that on the way up, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 100% margin. But I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sure if it was a trick question or--it sounds like it was. David Togut : No, it was just trying to understand how much of that incremental revenue would flow through to the bottom line since Don had talked a lot about investment initiatives, and you had underscored growth in sales force headcount. But thank you so much, very responsive. I appreciate it. Danyal Hussain : David, I would just add one clarification. You said incremental revenue. We did make the point in the prepared remarks that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the net impact of the portfolio that would be 100% incremental margin, so there is a cost offset and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the short term borrowing cost associated with the portfolio strategy. David Togut : Much appreciated, thank you. Operator : We have time for one more question, and that question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is open. Samad Samana : Hi, great. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just wanted to maybe circle back on the price increases. I know that inflation is a big driver of the maybe more than normal amount. Can you just maybe help us understand, would that put the company back on track if I think about deposit increases in maybe fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009921 during COVID, would it be linear from pre-COVID levels if we just thought about the price increases compounding or would it put you ahead of that because of inflation? Carlos, can you just remind us, do those price increases tend to stick if inflation starts to roll over? Carlos Rodriguez : Yes, I think again strategically, and maybe Dany and Don can get more specific on the numbers, but I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t characterize what we did as being out of step with the market. There was a pause for a few months, but our price increases--our intention was that our price increases during COVID were reflective of the inflation environment at that time as well. We did pause for a few months because, timing-wise, we just thought particularly in 2020 that it was inappropriate to be giving clients price increases one or two months into a global pandemic, but we eventually did some price increases but we did very modest price increases, because inflation was near zero for some period of time. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t if that answers it. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m trying to be responsive, but I think in general, we are always trying to remain in step with the market and still be competitive, because our number one goal is to gain market share. The trap that is easy to fall into when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a large company like ours is you can take price and take it higher than maybe you should be. You can usually do that multiple times and you can do that for a while, but it just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work forever because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just the law of economics and large numbers, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because of competition. So our intention, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important for you to understand that strategically is we want to grow and we want to gain market share, and to do that, we have to be competitive in terms of our products, our service, and also our price, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s--so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important when we do pricing actions, either on new business or on our existing book of business, that we remain in line with what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in the general market and with our competitors. Samad Samana : Great, I appreciate that, and good to see the strong results. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question and answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you. I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve--we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very happy with the quarter, as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure what else I could say, other than what I said about our sales performance, which I think is definitely the best I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in a long time. We talked a lot about our retention and some of the structural issues that are happening there, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to be more pleased about that. But I do want to reiterate again how happy we are with our organization and our team. First, we started with COVID and all the uncertainty that that created, everybody having to work from home, then we have all these regulatory changes, some of them very positive like the PPP loans, the ERPC that happened across the world, and while we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re then in the middle of that pandemic, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re telling our associates that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to work weekends and nights because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to keep up with all these regulatory changes and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to help our clients. Then as soon as that starts to abate a little bit, we get this great reshuffling and we start having challenges, which we overcame in terms of being able to add to staffing and so forth, so we asked our associates to once again work harder, put in the extra effort, and every time we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve asked, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come through for us, so--and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come through, more importantly, for our clients. We really do provide critical services across the world to our clients, and it was very, very important for our organization to come through for our clients, and I just want to again thank our associates for making it through so many ups and downs, where we just keep asking for a little bit more and they keep delivering, so I want to thank them once again.  Once again, thank you for your attention and your interest and the great questions, and we look forward to talking again in the next quarter. Thank you. Operator : This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Michelle, and I'll be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]  I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Danyal Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Danyal Hussain : Thank you, Michelle, and welcome, everyone to ADP's first quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. Participating today are Carlos Rodriguez, our CEO; Maria Black, our President; and Don McGuire, our CFO. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call.  During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these items, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measures, can be found in our earnings release. Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. And with that, let me turn it over to Carlos. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you, Danny, and thanks, everybody, for joining the call. As you saw this morning in the news, we have a little bit more excitement than normal, but I promise you that 1.5 hours from now, we'll go back to our boring cells because we do have a business to run.  But before I talk about the quarter, I thought it was appropriate to just share a few thoughts given the transition from me to Maria as our new CEO. As you know, I'm going to continue as Exec Chair, but obviously, that's going to be a role primarily to supporting Maria and also helping the Board and not really involved in day-to-day operations. So it's definitely going to be my last earnings call, which is hard to say because it\u2019s been 44 earnings calls for me. But it's really been an incredible ride.  Obviously, I could thank a lot of people. One person in particular that I do want to call out is John Jones, who is going to remain our Lead Independent Director. And the combination of John and Les Brun before him were incredible mentors to me, incredibly helpful in providing advice and guidance on behalf of the Board. And also, I'm proud to call them friends. And I also want to thank Gary Butler and Art Weinbach, my predecessors who gave me the opportunity to be here today and also help me a lot in terms of making me the person I am and the leader that I am today. I'm proud of a couple of things. I'll just mention a few. One of them is I'm proud of our growth. We doubled our revenues over the last 10 or 11 years. And today, as you know, we reached an important milestone of 1 million clients. So I appreciate -- I wish I could say that it was anything other than a coincidence. But however it happened. It's a great thing to have happened here on my last earnings call. We made it through a lot of challenges, economic. We went through, what I would call financial repression in terms of interest rates, which fortunately now we have a little bit of the opposite situation, which we'll talk about today. So there's many QEs. I think there were three QEs over my tenure. And then the final straw that almost broke the camel\u2019s back was interest rates. Even on the 10-year going, I think it was like under 0.5% in the pandemic, which was really kind of incredible to see happen. We also made it through a pandemic that hopefully only happens every 100 years, and we had some dissident shareholders that also had some opinions about how to run ADP that we had to deal with. I'm also proud of our associates. I'm proud they've always said about their commitment to our clients and to ADP. There's something that my predecessors and the culture have around our client centricity, which is really remarkable, and our associates always step up to the plate and deliver in a business that, again, we don't get a lot of credit, and I know that we're not quite up there in terms of the list of first responders and people who save lives. But we do keep the economy going, and we do, I think, make sure that commerce worldwide operates smoothly. So our associates are the ones who get that done, and I'm proud of them. The person I'm most proud of is Maria. She's now been tested. She's prepared. She's been through a very thoughtful and long succession process, and she's going to be the -- what is only the seventh CEO of ADP. And I know that she's the right person starting from the ground up. I wish I could have said that because that's what makes this special, this place special. We love to bring in talent from the outside but we have some incredible people that grow up and know this place, understand this place and know how to make it continue to hum the way it's been humming for more than 70 years. Most importantly, she not only knows our industry, but she knows our clients' needs deeply and takes great interest in that. And that is going to serve us well, as well as for growth orientation, which I think is going to be very important for ADP's future. Last thing I'll say is that I recently told our team at a senior meeting that I tried -- I strive to be what I learned about many, many years ago, something called a servant leader. And I tried to be that way to my team and to my organization here at ADP. But I want all of you to know that I tried to be that also to all of you and to our shareholders, as much as I tried to be that way for our clients and our associates. It's been truly an honor of a lifetime to serve ADP\u2019s CEO. And we are kind of a company that likes to fly under the radar. We kind of like it that way. So I know that nobody is going to write any books about us or they may not be even writing articles about us today, but this is one of the most successful commercial enterprises in history. All I have to do is go back and look at the track record. Most people don't do that. They don't go back and look at the 10-year to 20-year and, in our case, the 50 year. The company went public in 1961. I encourage you to look at our history, our results and our TSR and compare it to some of the greatest investors and investments of all time. And I think you'll see that ADP ranks right up at the top. Anybody who knows me knows how much I love sports and how -- what a sports -- I am. So I was trying to think of an analogy. And I feel like not only did I join the championship team, but I won the Super Bowl being here at ADP. It's really been an incredible ride. But right now, it's time to pass the torch. It's always great to have change, especially in a company like ADP because I know you can rely on our consistent, predictable results, but we also have to continue to grow for decades to come. And the only way to do that is to bring in fresh thinking and to have change. And that's exactly what we're doing with Maria. So before I talk about the quarter and the results, I'm going to turn it over to Maria and let her say a few things. Maria Black : Thank you, Carlos. You mentioned servant leadership, and I have to say that you are truly the embodiment of servant leadership. You have always kept our North Star true, which is putting our clients and our associates first. And I know I speak on behalf of all of our stakeholders, our associates, our shareholders, the communities we serve and the 1 million clients now we have the honor of serving and thanking you for everything that you've done over the decade that you served as our CEO. So my sincere thank you to you, Carlos.  I'm truly humbled and grateful for this opportunity and certainly for the confidence, Carlos that you've given me and that the Board has given me and entrusted me with this role. I am genuinely thrilled to lead ADP. You mentioned it, and it's true. I did start from the ground up. I started with this company 26 years ago, selling ADP's products and offering store-to-door. This ability to really see our clients from the front line has given me a vision and a true understanding of the client centricity that you mentioned that we embody as a company. And since selling 26 years ago door to door, I've served in roles all across ADP in sales and service, implementation, operations, including our PEO and SBS. I'm really, really proud of the role that we play in our clients' lives and how they trust us to really help them succeed in their HCM journey. For the last 73 years, we've had an amazing legacy and a culture. And that culture is really anchored in innovation and it's anchored in developing and providing technology and solutions that help address our clients' needs but also help address the needs of their workers. And I'm incredibly proud to be a part of that journey as we continue the modernization that we've been undergoing over the last few years. Of course, as you mentioned, none of this is possible without the 60,000 dedicated associates that we have that are at the center of absolutely everything that we deliver. I am committed to continuing to empower their great talent, which time and time again has reshaped the HCM industry through a relentless focus on again, solving our clients' needs and predicting their future needs. I'm also grounded by our history and our own beginning as a small business out of Paterson, New Jersey, founded by Henry Taub, a man who simply wanted to help local businesses. Then and now, I know and I feel deeply that this core value continues to define us as a company. So with that, thank you again, Carlos, and thank you to the Board. And now I will thank you in advance to all of our stakeholders in your confidence as we continue to build on ADP's incredibly strong results-oriented foundation. We continue to drive product innovation, leading technology. And more than anything, we continue deliver the consistent value creation that we're known for as the leader in the HCM industry.  So with that, I think it's appropriate to turn it over to the results this quarter. Carlos Rodriguez : Thanks, Maria. Speaking of consistent value creation, let me start talking a little bit about the results here so we can get to the questions. We got off to a really strong start in fiscal 2023, with strong results that reflected the momentum we've been building for several quarters now. In Q1, we delivered 10% revenue growth, 11% on an organic constant currency basis, and this was driven by strength in a number of our businesses. And on top of that, we delivered 30 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion as our revenue outperformance helped us overcome elevated expense grow over from last year's first quarter as well as continued investments in the business, which we anticipated and communicated to you last quarter.  We delivered 13% adjusted EPS growth in the quarter, and we remain well positioned as we move ahead for the rest of the year. I'll cover a few highlights for the quarter before I turn it back over to Maria. Our new business bookings, we showed continued momentum through Q1 with demand strongest in our downmarket offering like RUN and our retirement services businesses, and we also continue to see strong traction in our PEO solution. At the same time, bookings growth in our international business started a bit softer than we had hoped. We're continuing to watch the demand environment in international markets as clients and prospects there are dealing with a number of uncertainties, as you know. We are keeping an eye on the macroeconomic environment as well, but overall demand remains strong, and our pipeline looks solid. We'll share further updates on what we're seeing with bookings as we progress through the year. Our ES retention was very strong with a new overall Q1 record level led by great performance in our mid-market. We accomplished this year-over-year improvement despite further normalization in small business out of business rates in the quarter. We assume we will continue to experience normalization in out-of-business rates towards prepandemic levels as the year progresses, and we are clearly very pleased with the Q1 results and -- that were better than expected. Our pays to control metric was 6% for the quarter, in line with our expectations as strong hiring that our clients have conducted these past few quarters has carried through to strong pays per control growth this quarter. We continue to expect deceleration in pays per control growth later this year, and we've seen sequential employment growth begin to slow both in the National Employment Report and in public data. But that said, job postings and other leading indicators within our client base suggest that, at the very least in the short term, demand for labor will remain solid. And moving on to our PEO. We saw a modest deceleration in average worksite employee growth in the average worksite employee growth rate, which was anticipated, but the 12% growth was slightly ahead of our expectations for the quarter, and we're very pleased with that growth. Demand for both our PEO and our ES HRO offerings remains high as the value proposition for a fully outsourced model continues to resonate in the market. And in fact, our HRO businesses combine now to serve over 3 million worksite employees out of the 40 million total workers paid by ADP. Q1 not only provided a strong start to fiscal 2023 but also represented a major milestone in our company's history. As we -- as I mentioned earlier, we crossed the 1 million client mark during the quarter. What an incredible accomplishment. We accomplished this by driving improvement and growth on a consistent basis through decades of different employment cycles, business environments and technology shifts. It's a proud moment that was made possible only because of our relentless focus on meeting the needs of our clients, as Maria mentioned, both by delivering exceptional service and providing leading HCM technology. underpinning all of this is the dedication of our associates who ultimately make ADP a company it is today. As we look ahead, we recognize the need to remain agile in this unique and dynamic economic environment. And it is certainly our hope that inflation normalizes soon without significant harm to the global economy. But if macroeconomic conditions instead prove more challenging than we'd all like, we believe our stable business model should allow us to maintain our focus on innovation and our steady approach to investment, positioning us to continue driving long-term sustainable growth for many years to come. And it's for that reason that while I am incredibly excited to have reached 1 million clients, I'm even more excited about the opportunities ahead for ADP. And I'll now turn it over to our new CEO, Maria. Maria Black : Thank you, Carlos. As I mentioned earlier, I am also proud of the collective efforts of our associates who made this achievement possible. One of the beauties of having 1 million clients and directly serving 3 million worksite employees in our HRO businesses is that we have unparalleled insight into the needs of the HR department, and we are putting that insight to work. I'm proud to share that, in September, we won the top HR product at annual HR Tech Conference for the eighth year in a row, this time for a new offering we're calling Intelligent Self-Service. HR departments today devote a significant amount of time to addressing questions from their workers to help better manage this volume of worker and practitioner interaction. Intelligent Self-Service uses predictive analytics to help proactively address common issues before workers need to contact or HR leaders. Not only does this solution ultimately improve the experience for the worker, but it further enables the practitioner to focus on more strategic items, which is a key objective for our clients. There are a few different components to Intelligent Self-Service. The first is something we're calling action cards, which you can think of as proactive nudges in the ADP mobile app that appear in the flow of work so that workers are alerted and encouraged to act when there's something they need to address such as a missed time punch or time card approval. Another component of the offering is our virtual assistant chatbot, which was previously available to our clients' HR practitioners but is now, for the first time, being expanded to workers as well in order to address their requests or questions. And the third piece is case management, which helps with more complex problems that require HR systems. This feature presents a streamlined way to create, manage and track workers' interactions with our HR experts and quickly get to the right experts based on the workers made. Intelligent Self-Service is designed to create a better HR experience and reduce work, and we believe we are designing a solution that can reduce our clients' case volume by 30% or more, which, of course, would be an incredibly value-add win for everyone. We have already rolled out some of these components and are in pilot for others, but the feedback so far has been very positive. I also want to give a quick Q1 update on our new user experience. As a reminder, our new user experience represents a significant enhancement we've been making to our scaled strategic platforms using new design principles to make them even more intuitive and more personal so our users can easily leverage our solutions to the fullest. Last year, we moved clients on RUN, iHCM and Next Gen HCM as well as the ADP Mobile app over to the new user experience. And later in the year, we also moved 20,000 Workforce Now clients to the new UX. Enhancing Workforce Now is especially important given how integral the platform is to so many of our businesses, and I'm pleased to now share we've taken that 20,000 clients last year to over 80,000 through the end of Q1 with essentially all of Workforce Now clients on this new enhanced experience. Among other user experience initiatives, we relaunched the ADP RUN mobile app with our new UX with managers and HR practitioners of small businesses running payroll and HR while on the go. This app is a powerful tool for them, and the relaunch has been a resounding success. You can see the app and the reviews for yourself, but it's doing phenomenally well with 4.9 stars on several thousand reviews representing meaningful improvement from the experience it is replacing. These are exactly the types of outcomes we had hoped to achieve with this user experience work, and we are very excited about continuing to roll out to more solutions within our key platforms. From our voice of employee offering, we mentioned last quarter to our new Intelligent Self-Service capability to our UX deployment into our ongoing Next Gen rollout, our product teams are busy and our clients are excited about the continued innovation at ADP and our overall modernization journey. We look forward to continuing to develop ways to provide more value to our clients and prospects in this dynamic HCM and economic environment and to ultimately deliver on our bookings growth goals for this year and beyond.  And with that, over to Don. Don McGuire : Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter represented a strong start to the year with 10% revenue growth on a reported basis and 11% growth on an organic constant currency basis. Our EBIT margin was up 30 basis points, coming in above our expectations as strong overall revenue growth and growing clients fund interest revenue contribution as well as favorable workers' compensation reserve adjustments in our PEO overcame inflation-related cost pressures and higher-than-typical year-over-year headcount growth. Our robust revenue and margin performance combined to drive 13% adjusted EPS growth for the quarter supported by our ongoing return of cash to our investors via share repurchases. In our Employer Services segment, increased 9% on a reported and 11% on an organic constant currency basis. Key drivers to this growth were strong bookings and retention performance we delivered in recent quarters as well as solid contributions from price and pays per control. And of course, client funds interest, which mostly benefits the ES segment, grew nicely in Q1 with 39% growth driven by a healthy 9% balance growth and 40 basis point improvement in average yield. Partially offsetting that was FX, which was a slightly bigger headwind than we had anticipated. Our ES margin increase of 50 basis points was higher than planned primarily as a result of that strong revenue growth. For our PEO, revenue in the quarter grew 13%. Average worksite employees increased 12% on a year-over-year basis to $704,000 as bookings and same-store pays both continue to perform well, though the same-store pays contributed less than it did in recent quarters as we expected. PEO margin increased 80 basis points in the quarter due primarily to revenue growth and favorable workers' compensation reserve adjustments. Let me now turn to our updated outlook for fiscal '23. I think, overall, you'll find a very steady outlook compared to our prior guidance with upside due in part to higher interest rates.  Beginning with the ES segment revenues, we now expect growth of 7% to 8% and driven by the following key assumptions. First, we continue to expect ES new business bookings to grow between 6% and 9%. And as Carlos covered, we see a stable overall demand environment at this time, but it's still early in the year. And with a wide range of outcomes and we will continue to watch for impact from a potentially slowing global economy as we progress from here. For ES retention, we were happy to deliver another strong quarter, but we believe it's prudent to anticipate further normalization of small business out of business rates as we move through fiscal '23. As such, at this time, we're leaving our outlook unchanged at down 25 basis points to 50 basis points. Meanwhile, we will look to maintain our strong retention levels in our other business units. For pays per control, we had healthy 6% growth in Q1, in line with expectations, and we continue to anticipate a return to a more typical 2% to 3% growth rate for the full year as employment growth moderates. As we discussed last quarter, our pays per control growth outlook assumes a deceleration in growth in Q2 and very little growth in the second half of fiscal '23. This could, of course, prove to be either too conservative or bullish depending on how macroeconomic factors develop, but it still feels like a reasonable assumption to make at this point. Last quarter, we spoke a bit about price, and there is no change to our expectation for price to contribute about 100 basis points to 150 basis points to our ES revenue growth in fiscal '23. Our clients understand these price increases and recognize that they reflect our own cost pressures. And for client funds interest revenue, we now expect higher average rates compared to our prior outlook. Our client funds short portfolio will continue to benefit as the Federal funds rate increases over the balance of the fiscal year, and our new investments in our client extended and loan portfolios are now expected to yield about 4.3%. Between those two drivers, we now expect the average yield on our client funds portfolio to be 2.4% in fiscal '23, which is about 20 basis points higher than our prior outlook. We continue to expect our client funds balances to grow 4% to 6%. And putting those together, we now expect our client funds interest revenue to increase to a range of $790 million to $810 million in fiscal '23, up $70 million from our prior outlook. Partially offsetting this revenue upside is higher short-term borrowing costs associated with our client funds extended strategy. With higher expected commercial paper and reverse repo rates over the rest of the year, we now expect the net impact from our client fund's extended strategy to be $720 million to $740 million in fiscal '23, up $45 million from our prior outlook. One last factor to consider is our ES -- in our ES revenue outlook is FX headwind, which has unfortunately become a more meaningful drag over the last three months. We're now factoring in an FX headwind closer to 2% for fiscal '23 ES revenue, up slightly from our prior assumption. For ES margin, we now expect an increase of 200 basis points to 225 basis points, up 25 basis points from our prior outlook. We continue to expect our margins to benefit from our strong revenue growth outlook, including growth in client funds interest revenue, and we're pleased to be able to increase our outlook accordingly. Moving on to the PEO segment, where we're making very few changes. We continue to expect PEO revenue and PEO revenue excluding zero margin pass-throughs to grow 10% to 12%. The primary driver for our PEO growth is our outlook for average worksite employee growth of 8% to 10%. We now expect PEO margin to be flat to up 25 basis points in fiscal '23, narrowing our prior range higher due in part to the strong Q1 margin performance. Adding it all up, we now expect consolidated revenue growth of 8% to 9% in fiscal '23 and adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 125 basis points to 150 basis points. We still expect our effective tax rate for fiscal '23 to be about 23%, and we now expect adjusted EPS growth of 15% to 17% supported by our steady share repurchases. And now I'll turn it back to the operator for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Pete Christiansen with Citi. Peter Christiansen : First, congrats to Maria. Looking forward to seeing your touch on strategic vision here and certainly to Carlos for such a successful tenure as CEO, particularly through some volatile events in the last couple of years, for sure. I just had a question as it relates to bookings trends certainly see that the outlook is held steady. And I know that we're kind of early in the selling season. But if there's any -- just wondering if you could put any color on any differentiating trends you're seeing at this point of the year, maybe perhaps versus the last year or two, maybe attach rates or on ancillary modules or even going to more outsourced models, seeing any changes in behavior there? And then as it relates to the pricing discussion that we just had, do you feel like you have any more room? It seems like your clients are responding well and things look good. But do you still -- do you think that there's potential upside to the pricing strategy? Sorry. Maria Black : Thank you, Pete, and thank you for the well wishes. I certainly appreciate them. And as you mentioned, look forward to connecting with many of you around strategic vision going forward. With respect to bookings and really thinking through year-on-year changes in behavior, I'll comment on that, and then I'll turn it over to Don that can talk about whether or not we have more room on price. . But again, just to kind of confirm the overall outlook at 6% to 9%, we do feel confident in this outlook. When I think about how we planned for the year, and we were generally pleased with the results that we saw in the first quarter, in fact, they were actually technically a record from a year-on-year perspective. But the thing that makes us not necessarily call that out in that way and really speaking to the continued momentum, to your question, it's really about in the context of the records that we've had, in the past few quarters, it's really been broad-based across every bit of the portfolio. And as you heard in the prepared remarks this morning, we had significant strength in our downmarket offerings. Really pleased to see that across our RUN portfolio, the small business segment inclusive of our insurance offerings, retirement offerings. We also continue to have significant strength in our HRO offerings, inclusive of the PEO. So in terms of changing behavior, I see that as constant behavior as it relates to -- those are businesses that have had continued strength over several quarters and the value proposition, both downmarket and certainly into the HRO space has been good. I think the area, again, that we called out a little bit that we're keeping an eye on is really our international business. Now the good news with our international business is that it's a small contributor to our overall bookings. But when we look at what really happened with the international space, specifically for this quarter, we don't still actually see a macro impact. We see more of an impact of the strength that we had coming into or coming off of a record Q4. And so when you think about our upmarket business, specifically our international business, there are times that it's a bit lumpy as we pull deals forward to accelerate through the fourth quarter. And candidly, who wouldn't want to have an incredible finish and an incredible quarter? But as it has for several decades, I would say that does sometimes lend itself to some of those businesses needing -- continue to rebuild the pipeline. So that's really what we think is happening. But at the same time, we're very -- we're keeping an eye on specifically in Europe, what's happening in the Ukraine, what's happening with the energy crisis. Those are watch items for us. But just kind of reiterate, we don't see any macro overall trends. We don't see changes in behavior. We see the strength continuing in the downmarket and into our HRO and PEO offerings, and we were very, very pleased with the results this quarter, and they are record results in that respect. Don McGuire : Yes. And with respect to the pricing, we've been very happy with our ability to execute the price increase in the way we did. And as we've said on prior calls, we're mindful of the fact that these are incremental costs for our clients as well, and we need to be competitive. So we made sure that we've price increased and passed on the costs we have in a way that keeps our customers with us for a very, very long time. Having said that, we said 100 basis points to 150 basis points. And I would tell you that, currently, we're pushing towards the upper end of that range in the price increase. So we've done very well against expectations and executed, as I said, well across the business. Of course, is there more available? Good question. If we look at our client base, particularly with the large clients, we do have contractual obligations that come due from time to time. And a number of those are tied to various price indices, et cetera. So that limits the ability to do anything beyond some of the pricing indices that drive or undermine or underlay, if you will, the price that we have. But I guess I would say we've been very happy with where we are now, and we'll always look to see if there's an opportunity. But I think that we want to make sure -- we will continue to make sure that we do what's best for ADP in the long term as opposed to being too overzealous, if you will, with short-term price increases. Operator : Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Tien-Tsin Huang : Great. Carlos, I want to say, again, again, grateful to have worked with you and share the time and learn from you from, I guess, over 40 earnings calls and meetings and stuff. So I appreciate that. And of course, congrats to Maria. I want to just ask, if you don't mind, 100% agree from the release, Carlos led the transition from payroll to HCM. So I know you can't tell us everything in terms of what's next here, but is it fair to think the focus might be more so on the employee now in addition to the employer, in addition to modernization, maybe data? Just maybe some thoughts there would be great. Love to hear it. Carlos Rodriguez : I think that was for you, Maria, given that I'll be sitting on the beach. Maria Black : Fair enough. Thank you for the chance to comment a little bit. Obviously, early days as it relates to -- I mean essentially starting as early days as it relates to having conversations around long-term strategy. I think the first thing I'd like to reiterate, I know I talked about my 26 years here. I have spent eight of those as part of the incredible management team that Carlos alluded to earlier, and that's been a part of the journey that we've been on as it relates to the overall modernization journey. So I think you mentioned the transition from payroll to HCM. That is a piece of that modernization. But in my mind, it's more broad-based than that. It's really been about the decisions we've made, everything from our strategic locations to early days of platform migrations to configuring our organization to really create a technology organization. We've been actively modernizing our service organization. You hear me speak about that all the time in terms of continuing the modernization of tools but also making sure that we're taking the work out for our clients. We've been making a transition to the public cloud. And then one of my favorite topics is the modern selling approach that we've been embarking upon that really, as we go on for many years as we found it inside sales, if you will, 20 years ago to the most recent during the pandemic, really focused on digital selling and meeting the buyers in a different way. So I think all of that is really about our modernization journey. And I think as I look forward into the next decade, if you will, in the next chapter, it is really about continuing the great work and the foundation that you mentioned that Carlos laid. I have a lot of passion around our clients. I have a lot of passion around the 40 million workers that they pay and how we can create value for each one of those stakeholders, both the workers as you mentioned, the clients' employees as well as our clients. And my ultimate goal, Carlos touched on it, I think I mentioned it as well upfront, when I think about client centricity and really solving meaningful things for our clients, I think the last decade in this modernization journey has really been about setting us up to be able to deliver value in a very different way for our clients. My goal would be to continue that journey and, in the end, make sure that our clients are in love with our products and in love with the experience that they have with ADP and the true evangelists of what it is that we bring. And I feel confident in how we've been set up to embark on that journey, and I look forward to sharing more with you on it as we move forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : Great. And my congratulations all around as well. Carlos, I guess, why is now the right time? I mean you've done an amazing job, you're still incredibly young. Just any thoughts as to why transition now? Carlos Rodriguez : Actually, it's a good question because, honestly, it's something that we started -- we were joking about it yesterday, that I started talking about this about 12 months after I became CEO. Not that I was trying to leave 12 months after I became CEO. But in case people haven't noticed, I'm like a business junky, right? So I just love business. I also love kind of the whole idea of like a successful commercial enterprise, and you have this kind of tension in this area of succession where the longer you are around, the more you know. There's some studies out there that show that beyond a certain amount of time is really when CEOs hit their stride. But then there's an equal amount of research that shows you move beyond a certain time, you become stale. You don't have any new ideas. You become enamored with your own ideas and thoughts. And so I have not written the book on this, but I read a lot of books on this. And my sense was that kind of beyond seven years was -- there was diminishing returns based on my \"research.\" And you can see that I made it past that. And some of that was -- circumstances, I think, made it such because I didn't have any specific goal. Like I'm not trying to run out the door. My -- the only thing I want to do is the best thing for ADP, and the best thing in this case now for Maria and for our Board. And so this is a collective decision over -- I know it's hard to believe but really over a decade as to what the right timing was, who the right person was and how to position them for success and how to position the company for success. By the way, that also involves -- we had a very meaningful refreshment of our Board that, I think, is something that has to be taken into context because it's all a package, right? It's the right CEO, the right Board, the right Board leadership. And so I think that bringing the Board along, I think, required a little bit more time than I had expected. So that's a long way of saying I don't have any magic answers to what the right time is. What I know for sure is not the right way to do it. There's nothing to do with my age and whether I'm young or I'm old or whatnot. It has to be done when it's the right time and it's the best thing for ADP, and I think that's what we just did. Kevin McVeigh : That makes a lot of sense. The numbers speak for themselves. So I'll leave it there. Congrats again. Carlos Rodriguez : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Carlos, just -- or Maria, just your thoughts on the economy. Obviously, I look at your results and things look good. I know you said maybe the second half, you're just being a little bit more cautious. But as you look at kind of the numbers now and you talk to your customers, just your thoughts on how the economy looks now and just kind of the outlook over the next six to nine months? Carlos Rodriguez : So we obviously don't have the market cornered on economic forecast. We do have a reasonable amount of data, particularly on what I would call the near-term next few quarters, I would say. But when you look at the last two, three, five years, 10 years, really, as long as I've been doing this, you have to be really careful about taking economic forecasts at face value. So you have to be careful. You have to be prepared for all eventualities. And that's why we like to call ourselves an all-weather business model because I think we actually perform, I think, through a variety -- obviously, better in some than others. But I guess that's the way of saying we're not obsessed with economic forecast because if I had taken economic forecast at face value over the last three or four years, we would have made numerous mistakes. And I think all I have to do is go back. I know nobody does this because otherwise there wouldn't be -- economists wouldn't exist. But if you look at what economists forecast 12 months prior and then what actually happened or 20 months prior to what actually happened, that's not really the right way to run a business. But it doesn't inform our decisions right, and our planning.  And as you mentioned, what happened this year in terms of our fiscal year planning is we thought -- kind of common sense told us that some of these things were going to happen like normalization of downmarket retention, right, towards hopefully still above pre-pandemic levels but not at the kind of levels they were when the government was providing so much support for small businesses that you could just see it in the data in terms of the drop in bankruptcies and out of business and so forth. So we expected some normalization there. Likewise, pays per control, it's not -- you just don't make numbers up. Like we -- if you assume that you reach kind of \"full employment\", and that the population and employment [Audio Gap] employable people is growing at a certain rate, you can kind of back into kind of a normalized pays per control rate, and then you sprinkle in a little bit -- maybe there's going to be some economic weakness in the back half. And I think what we signaled and what we have in our plan is, I think, kind of flattish pays per control growth, which to me personally is feeling conservative right now based on the -- we feel like we have this kind of continued strength into this quarter, and that typically doesn't fall off the cliff right away. But maybe that happens in the first quarter of '24 that it becomes flattish. I don't know. But I know that right now, there are definitely still -- we got back to what employment was pre pandemic, but the population also grew and the employable number of people grew. So labor force participation is still below where it was before. So there is definitely still room for some employment growth there. So this could be a very strange slowdown, right, or if you want to call it a recession, where it's, I think Danny calls it a labor full recession where it doesn't feel like employment, at least the stuff that we look at background checks, job postings, et cetera. I mean if you look at the jokes, you look at everything, there's still a lot of -- we had 260,000 jobs created -- and that wasn't 500,000, it wasn't 1 million, but in any other environment, that would be like an incredibly strong number, but it's clearly is clearly slowing, but everything we see is that the labor markets remain, again, in the time horizon that we have visibility to pretty strong or certainly not as strong as a year ago or when we were in the middle of the recovery from the pandemic, but that's really more of the comparisons than kind of anything underlying. So I think we're just heading back to kind of more normal rates, but in an unusual way where the labor market doesn't appear to be the leading the leader in the slowdown. It appears to be people spending less on stuff that they spent a lot of during the pandemic, if I can be bold. That might be like exercise bicycles. It might be things like grills, like -- and maybe even, unfortunately, for a company that's close to my heart, software, right, and some things that are -- that you have these kind of, unfortunately, fluctuations of demand that we've never seen before. And so the now how do you predict and forecast how that all kind of lands in the medium to longer term. It's very, very hard for any company to do. But specifically for us, labor is still strong. As long as labor is strong, our clients are still looking for tools to employ, to hire and to manage that labor. And we have this other little weird thing happening to us, which is really fantastic, which is interest rates are rising. And they\u2019re rising in the face -- I mean, typically, when interest rates are rising, the economy is slowing, and that's exactly obviously what the intent of the Fed is. But right now, you're kind of at this point where we're getting this big tailwind from interest rates, and it doesn't feel like that's going to change again in the near term. It doesn't mean that rates won't stop increasing, but if rates stop increasing, like, for example, like in the spring of '23, and they stay there, home run for ADP. All of you and everybody internally here at ADP make fun of me when I used to talk about how our balances in 2008 were like $15 billion and they had grown to $30 billion, but our client funds interest had been cut almost by 2/3 because of interest rates. And I used to say, \"Can you imagine if interest rates go back to where they -- near back to where they were back then, but our balance is now are $33 million and growing, I think it was 9.5% this quarter, wouldn't that be amazing?\" And that's exactly what's happening. So I'm leaving a little bit of gas in the tank for Maria. Well, actually, I can't take credit for that. I appreciate Chairman Powell helped with that. But we -- I think we have some gas in the tank here with interest rates as well, which again, is a little unusual, but I don't know if you want to call it a hedge to our business model, but -- it's definitely welcome because we are -- as you know, we always carefully watch our expenses and everything in ADP, but it's a much better place to be from an ability to invest and an ability to weather when you have this significant tailwind, which is not a secret. I mean I think Don laid out the numbers, and you can do the math. It's a pretty big tailwind. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Jason Kupferberg : Congrats Maria. Congrats to Carlos as well. I had two questions. The first one, just, Maria, picking up on your comments around some of the Intelligent Self-Service offerings. I think you made mention of the potential for customer service cases to be cut by 30%. I was just curious to get a little more color around that, what might be the time line for achieving that goal. And is that any kind of rough proxy for how much your customer service costs could be reduced over time if this is successful? Maria Black : Thank you, Jason, for the well wishes. And I'm actually -- I'm glad you asked this question because I wanted to make sure there's clarity around that 30%. And that 30%, just so we're all on the same page, it's really about our clients being able to save that time. So this is really about serving up, leveraging intelligence, artificial intelligence, machine learning. It's really serving us the most frequent interactions that can be either performed in a self-service capacity or really performed again through this case management and really taking the work out than necessarily, call it, taking the work out of our system. It's really about giving that 30% to our clients.  In fairness, it is early days as we measure this. And when I say that, I'd say that lightly in that we did study this across our 3 million HR worksite employees, if I may call them that, that in terms of the most frequent cases that get served up and what that would yield in terms of a return to our clients. And that's where that 30% comes from. But as we launch this product and more and more adoption happens, we will be keeping a keen eye on that outcome to ensure that, that number remains true, and our hope is to continue to make progress and take more work out of our -- out of the system for our clients as they navigate the relationship between them and the practitioners and the workers. Jason Kupferberg : Just one quick follow-up. Just if nothing had changed in the rate environment since the time of the last earnings call, would you guys have raised revenue or margin guidance for fiscal '23? Don McGuire : I think it's -- certainly, the rates helped us. But just a couple of things to comment on. Certainly, we still we're performing well against our internal expectations on margin improvement. So we're still very focused on spend and efficiency of spend, et cetera. But I don't think that we would have been as -- we wouldn't have been as eager to raise expectations in the absence of interest rates, especially given it's still Q1, and we need a little bit of time to see how things progress over the next couple of quarters. Carlos Rodriguez : Well, that's fair. But I'm pretty happy with the results because we -- Don, this is just the way our culture is. So everybody is talking about all the positives that we have, like interest income and so forth. But we had some headwinds as well. Like our T&E is up significantly. Remember, last -- it's hard to remember that last year, this quarter, I think we were still in the whole Omicron thing. It was just starting and we really hadn't opened up most of our buildings. I think our salespeople were for sure in the field but not traveling and spending the way they are now. By the way, we were very grateful that we have them back in the field. . So like there are a couple of things like T&E is the smallest of them. The biggest one is when you look at our headcount numbers, it hasn't come up yet, but our sales force is I think, more than fully staffed. And as you probably heard from our comments six to nine months ago, it was difficult to get there back then. Now not only are we fully staffed but our turnover is coming down across the board not just in sales but also across the rest of the organization. So all of a sudden, if you look at our headcount growth for this quarter, it is what I would call a peak and the highest I have ever seen since I've been here at ADP. That was necessary because there was some catch-up, which is why we -- I called it a grow-over issue from last year's first quarter, where we were definitely understaffed, didn't have enough people. And then all of a sudden, our revenues actually were outperforming. The number of clients is outperforming, and you know how important retention is to us. So we set to basically stop up across the Board implementation, service and sales. And that's when you had that whole great resignation thing happening at the same time. And it was -- I mean, again, I don't think most companies go around talking about this, but we were trying to hire as fast and as many people as we could at that point. The good news is we were successful. I think the better news is that puts us in, I think, in a good position in terms of staffing and sales, but also in terms of our service and implementation organizations. And now with declining turnover again, from a plan standpoint, besides planning for patient for control to be \"flattish\" in the second half, our headcount growth declines -- the growth of headcount declines every quarter for the next 4 quarters. And I think that, I think, should help us feel good about this quarter and also about the fiscal year. So I think technically, Don is correct. By the way, if you go back to ADP's 10-year history, this has been a weird two or three years like us not raising as we hadn't raised in the quarter, again, I don't know what you would have thought of that or what it would have meant, but I think that's pretty -- any maybe can confirm or tell me I'm wrong, but like we weren't in the habit of changing a lot in the first quarter because this is -- how can we say this is a predictable, stable business that we know what we're doing and then changing set every quarter. It doesn't make sense. Now we have a pandemic, that's a different story. Like we struggled like everyone else to kind of keep a handle on what things were happening -- how things were happening on the way down and also on the way back up. But this is going to be a much more stable environment. I would hope some of you would welcome that. But with 10%, 11% growth organic and our headwinds from expenses abating here a little bit, I think we're in a pretty good position. Danyal Hussain : Jason, the only other thing I would point out is that in addition to interest becoming more favorable and contributing to most of the raise as you can calculate on your own, FX obviously also got worse. So in this parallel universe without a higher interest rate, we would perhaps be absorbing that higher FX and not changing the outlook. Operator : Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Bryan Bergin : First congrats, Carlos, on your success; and Maria, on the promotion. I wanted to just start with a more specific follow-up on the bookings trends in the pipeline. Can you just give more color on what you're seeing in those forward sales indicators, lead volumes, sales cycles in recent weeks? And really just any discernible changes you've noticed there? Carlos Rodriguez : Yes. I think Maria can talk about -- I think she's actually been looking into a lot of the details around pipeline disorder. The only thing that I would add is color commentary. I was trying to defer to Maria on kind of the big picture in terms of bookings. But since I've been doing this for a long time, 44 quarters and then many years kind of watching from, I guess, a year before that as not quite a year, but as President, and before that, I really paid close attention to all this stuff. And Maria mentioned it, but the problem with the crystal ball right now is that when we have the kind of finish we had, you saw how enthusiastic we were and how bullish we were in terms of our finish and whatnot. And almost predictably, when we have that kind of finish, about half of our business, we count the bookings when we sign a contract. And the other half, we only count the bookings once the client starts. And that portion of the business that -- like, by the way, that's the way most companies that sell to larger clients book their bookings, which is when you sign a contract. That's why it's called bookings. That has always been an issue when we have this very strong quarter and very strong finish, the pull-forward stuff has been driving me crazy forever because we have very strong incentives and what we call accelerators in terms of commissions and so forth that drive, and we want that because we want to get the revenue as quickly as possible, but that sometimes leads to kind of a weaker start. The problem here is that on top of that, now you have a macroeconomic challenge potentially, we definitely have a macroeconomic challenge in Europe. Luckily, it's not a huge part our bookings. So it's hard to differentiate. But what I would tell you, again, back to color, the businesses that we count the bookings when they start are mostly the downmarket businesses. So that would be SBS, PEO, et cetera. We had double-digit bookings growth in those businesses. That makes me think that it's unlikely that, all of a sudden, we have an economic whatever challenge or disaster because why would those businesses still be performing the way they are. But I would just -- a forward-looking statement, I would say I don't know for sure that that there isn't a problem in terms of demand or the economy or whatnot, but it doesn't feel from the first quarter like we could put our finger on something that says, holy cow, we have to put the kind of the red flag or the yellow warning flag up just yet. And I don't know, Maria, if you have comments in terms of a little bit more tangible\u2026 Maria Black : Yes. Thank you, Carlos. He's right. Carlos is right. I've been studying deeply the pipeline specifically of these businesses that recognize bookings potentially have some of the pull forward into the fourth quarter. And that's primarily in the larger size type of organizations. And so in studying the pipeline kind of segment by segment, country by country, if you will, and deeply, it does appear that the pipelines are there, the pipelines are continuing to build when I think about deal cycle time, right? So you think about all the data points we are analyzing on a daily basis to really understand the question you're asking, Bryan, which is, is this an economic and macro, is this -- what is this. And the answer is, from a pipeline perspective, the pipelines are healthy. From a deal cycle time, let's go back to Carlos' commentary. It does appear that we did have a lot of pull forward, and there were potentially not enough days to pull things into the first quarter. And we have -- again, what does that really mean in the macro? It's really returning to more pre-pandemic levels. So these are not concerning deal cycle times. These are actually more normal deal cycle times, the ones that we saw pre-pandemic. What I'm referring to there is really there used to be a time that it did take a lot of time to move larger deals through the system because so many individuals are involved, whether that's on the contracting side, the legal side. During the pandemic, there was a deal acceleration that happened, and a lot of that has to do with us being stationary. That's no longer the case. We see that every day in terms of the world is back at work. And companies are reporting in the news, we are seeing incredible strength amongst our client base. We're seeing demand for HCM. There is 6% pays per control growth. So as Carlos mentioned earlier, the jobs are there. Our clients are growing. Our products and offerings fit right into that sweet spot that everybody is still trying to solve for, and our pipelines are healthy. So at this juncture, there really isn't a macro broad-based trend that we can see besides the watch areas we've called out. I think the only other comment I would make, I alluded to it earlier, and is please remember that when a quarter ago, we gave the guidance for the 6% to 9%. The way that we thought about the year, first and foremost, the first quarter is the lightest quarter for us from a pure dollar perspective. So it's the smaller contributor from a dollar perspective on the full year. The way that we planned the year, which we talked about on the 6% to 9% bookings guidance that we gave a quarter ago was really assuming some elements of a slowdown in the back half, specifically in the fourth quarter. So it's really about this quarter, i.e., the current one that we're in, which is the second quarter and the third quarter, and so in looking at where we stand today, we feel confident in the 6% to 9% in terms of how we plan for it. We didn't assume massive and severe recession, but we definitely have assumptions in there that we feel confident at this point that we can execute against. Carlos Rodriguez : And one of the -- if I can just add like one of the beauties of our business model is that bookings are, for sure, an incredibly important thing, especially kind of over the longer term. But I mean, I hope it's obvious that, from a revenue standpoint, again, with visibility only for the next two, three quarters, we have -- it's really about converting prior sales, which were incredibly strong in prior bookings. I mean you saw what our bookings results were for the fourth quarter and for the year. So that's the stuff that now turns into revenue in those businesses where we recognize the booking at the time we sign a contract. So that -- it's just -- I know it's obvious but just a reminder because this business doesn't -- we're not selling widgets, where if you stop selling widgets, like all of a sudden you're back to zero next quarter, like the -- I think we have a solid revenue plan that I think reflects, as Maria said, what I think was already a pretty conservative number in terms of bookings growth, particularly in the back half of the year. So we may have other issues like FX on the negative side, clients fund interest may help even more or may help less, but I don't think the bookings issue is a fiscal '23 focus item in terms of impact on revenue. Bryan Bergin : Okay. All right. A follow-up on retention then. It seems like it's fair to say you beat your plan in 1Q. But what do you attribute that 1Q success to? Was it more a function of a slower rate of SMB out-of-business losses? Or do you think it also did better on the controllable factors as well? Carlos Rodriguez : It's really -- I think it's -- the controllable factors, I think, are the most satisfying part of the whole story because the story is kind of playing out a little bit the way we expected, which is small business is kind of in the process of kind of normalizing. But the really -- by the way, positive ironically in our international business, which might not be so ironic because the challenges economically, there are probably getting -- convincing people that they stay put. I don't want to say that it's not all great execution because we have a great leader in international, and we have the former great leader of international here, which is Don McGuire. So there's a lot of great things that have happened in that business that are probably powering some underlying improvement in retention. So some of it is probably inertia as a result of what's happening in the economic environment there. But the most satisfying part of the whole story here is what's happening in the mid-market, where I think some fundamental improvements that we made pre-pandemic, you remember all the pain in terms of the migrations and then the improvements in product, the UX experience improvements, all those things, it just seems like it's ratcheted up the \"potential\", the maximum potential retention, if you will, for our mid-market business, which was a record this quarter as well. Clearly, the down market -- the pace of normalization of the down market has some impact. But the big story, I think, this quarter was really the mid-market, and our international business has helped a lot on the retention side. Danyal Hussain : Bryan, I'll just confirm the down market didn't really contribute to the outperformance versus our expectations. So the mid-market was clearly the bigger piece. Operator : Our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Samad Samana : I'll congrats that is given so far as well. Maybe just a question. When I think about the transitioning of the Workforce Now base to the new UX and the progress there and -- market, how should we think about maybe that were going to translate into monetary benefits? Is that more of a benefit in gross margin for a lower cost to serve or just less back-end work or higher retention, all of the above? Just help us maybe map what the kind of economic outcome is from moving over to the new UX for ADP. Maria Black : I have a lot of time for our new UX. I can't boast about it enough. And the majority of that reason is all of the above. We expect this to impact our clients' satisfaction, their retention, our ability to demo more, sell more. In terms of teasing out the specific results difficult, but the answer to your question is all of the above. Samad Samana : Got you. And then maybe one for Don, any thoughts on locking in or changing duration with rates where they are? Just as I think if I look back historically at the presentation, yields currently are higher than they've been at kind of any time for even what the long end of the portfolio looks like. Any -- any view on changing duration? I know you guys get what the mix is, but I'm curious if it were locking it in for a longer duration. Don McGuire : Yes, I'm going to start on this, but something tells me Carlos won't be able to resist following up on whatever I have to say here. So I guess I would say that the laddering strategy that was implemented a number of years ago has delivered great returns. And while I think everyone can see the temptation of changing the duration and trying to benefit more from short-term rates, rates will either normalize or they may even come down again at some point in the future. So this laddering strategy that's been deployed over the number of years has served us very well, and we expect it will continue to serve us well. And not to say that this question doesn't come up from time to time if we discuss it. But every time that we look at it, we -- you really either -- you're making a bet for today as opposed to for down the road. And given the positive experience we've had, it doesn't really behoove us to make any substantial changes to a policy and a program that has been doing very, very well. Carlos, I'm sure... Carlos Rodriguez : I have nothing to add other than -- I obviously picked the right time to retire. Very well said. And because I think that encapsulates lots of other things where we focus more on the longer-term in the medium term rather than because, again, if rates do normalize, as you said, we're going to be very grateful that we -- that our extended portfolio that we took advantage of these \"higher rates\" that will help us for two, three, in some cases, five years down the road. So it's the right -- we're not a financial services company. We're not a bank, and that's not the kind of best that we're trying to make here. This is just -- happens to be a nice little windfall as a result of a business model that we have that allows us to kind of manage float income at a very, very large scale. And anyway, well said. Samad Samana : I think we all appreciate the institutional continuity as the transition occurs. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Mark Marcon : Carlos, congratulations on a great tenure not just as CEO but everything that you did prior to that. And Maria, look forward to working with you and getting to know you even more over the coming years. I'm wondering, can you talk a little bit about how you're set up for this current fall selling season? Certainly, you've got a number of big product improvements. Which ones could we end up seeing like being incremental in terms of PEPM? And just how strong do you think the sales momentum could be? How are you thinking about your marketing efforts, particularly with all the improvements that you've got in place? Maria Black : Yes. Thanks, Mark. And similarly, I look forward to spending more time together, and I've appreciated the time thus far that we spent together getting to know each other. So in terms of selling season, we do feel -- I think Carlos mentioned, I think the first call-out I would make, I know you asked specifically about products and contributions PEPM, but I think it's important to go back to the discussion that Carlos had around headcount. So I've been -- I spent some of last year and last fiscal year speaking about a flattish headcount growth as it related to sales. We committed to a -- business growth heading into the quarter, and I'm pleased to report, as Carlos alluded to, that we are ahead of those plans. And so what that means is that we have more quota carriers in the system as we head into selling season, significantly more than we expected but significantly more than last selling season. And that, in and of itself, is the biggest contributor that we have to our overall results as we think about the productivity of more people in the system and, as Carlos also mentioned, with tenure of those associates picking up the increase in productivity of our sellers as they lap the 10-year band. So I think that's the biggest variable I see. We do have a lot of amazing things as it relates to products in the system. Certainly, the new user experience being broad-based across all of the products gives the sellers an extra step in their momentum as they head into the end of the year as it relates to demos due to that nature. I mentioned some of the other products such as the voice of the employee and our Intelligent Self-Service, which both serve us up through our mid-market. So that mid-market value proposition is continuing to grow. The other is the strength that we are seeing in that PEO and the HRO are comprehensive and managed services business -- businesses as it relates to customers that are continuing to face the complexity. By the way, whether they are up market, in the mid-market or even down market needing more of those tools to navigate the complexity of being an employer, and so we see tremendous strength there. And so we're making good progress on our Next Gen. Very pleased to see specifically on our Next Gen Payroll how that's resonating in the mid-market with Workforce Now. And as we continue to increase the addressable area that we are able to target with those offerings undoubtedly will yield, as you suggested, greater sales, greater PEPM as well some of these enhanced features and products that are served up through our existing platforms that I've mentioned before. Mark Marcon : That's great. And then with regards to Next Gen Payroll, can you give us an update in terms of what percentage of the new Workforce Now clients are now getting Next Gen Payroll? Maria Black : Yes. So we are -- we committed to -- and I've been talking about kind of that 50% of our overall mid-market and Workforce Now clients, and we continue to make progress on that. So we're not entirely -- at the entire market that work with an outsource today. But each and every day, actually, in every release, we continue to clear the path for more and more opportunities to be able to participate in that Next Gen offering, which is truly the game changer for ADP as it relates to the innovation there. Mark Marcon : That's terrific. And Carlos, in terms of sports analogy, maybe Don Shula might be appropriate, great track record. Congrats. Carlos Rodriguez : Yes, listen, I appreciate that because I joke around with people that I used to actually watch TV and sports a long time ago, but there was like about a 20-year period where I have no idea what's going on. But I do know Don Shula and I know the goose egg defense, I think they were called to say, whatever the hell they were. Mark Marcon : It was the no-name defense. Carlos Rodriguez : So no-name defense. There you go there. I screwed it up. It was trying to prove that I actually knew something about sports and I blew it so. But I appreciate that. That's greatly appreciated. You're a class act yourself, Mark. Thank you. Operator : We have time for one more question, and it comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. David Togut : Good morning, and congratulations, Carlos and Maria, Carlos, all the best for you in the next chapter. Don, a question for you on pays per control growth. 6%, clearly well above the 2% to 3% guide. But as you noted, contemplated, can you walk us through the sequencing of kind of pays per control in terms of what's embedded in the quarterly thought process as we go through FY '23? Don McGuire : Yes. So I think we were happy with 6% growth in the first quarter. And once again, back to Carlos' earlier comments, if you had believed all the economic forecasts, you might not have been expecting to see that stronger growth in pays per control. But we do continue to see the pays per control growth moderating down in the first half of this year. And as we shared -- as I shared in the prior -- the prepared comments, we have virtually zero pays per control growth in the back half of the year. So we do expect that we should -- given the strength of the first quarter, the first half should be a little bit better. I think we've reflected that in some of our guidance here already. And as we go through the next few months, we will be in a position to better decide whether we think we're going to be bullish or bearish on what's going to happen in the back half. And quite frankly, I think we'd all like to be very bullish about what's going to happen based on the first quarter's results, but I think if we did that, we'd kind of look a little bit foolish given all the predictions and all the storm clouds that people are talking about. So 6% first quarter slowing for the first half and then essentially very little growth if any, in the back half is what we're looking at. Carlos Rodriguez : Yes. And I think the simple math is, again, rather than getting into individual quarters because that talk about trying to like -- it's very hard to pin down that exact number. But I think ballpark, 6 for the first half, zero for the second half, gets you to 2 to 3 that you have for the full year. I mean that's probably the right -- obviously, the way we laid it out is slightly different than that but that's close enough, I think, for what you're trying to accomplish, I think. David Togut : Appreciate that insight. Just as a quick follow-up. Looking at Slide [Audio Gap] zero, the 25 basis point increase for the full year. Can you walk us through how big the workers' compensation reserve adjustment was in the September quarter and how you expect that to trend through the year? Don McGuire : Sure. I mean, I can give you the specific numbers, you'll see them later in the Q anyway. So the -- we had a $14 million positive adjustment in the first quarter, and that compares to a $10 million positive adjustment in the first quarter of last year. So not that significant, $4 million, give or take. So that's the -- those are the raw numbers. We do not expect to see as good a reserve release in this fiscal year as we saw last year. There's still several quarters to go through, and the actuarials let us know what those numbers are, but we are contemplating the same level of reserve adjustment or recovery as we did in FY '22. Carlos Rodriguez : The only -- the other color commentary that I would add is, I think the PEO -- again, if you look at last year, it's obviously, we've seen, as expected, some deceleration, but I would call 12% employee growth is still pretty strong. That obviously requires investment, right, in terms of service, implementation expense, et cetera. And so I would say that the PEO is one of those places where we were really adding a lot in terms of expense and resources from a place where we were not where we needed to be, call it, last year's first quarter. So that's the poster child, I think, for this kind of grow-over expense situation that we have. But the good news is, I think, is we are -- we're staffed. Again, turnover is improving across the board in terms of all parts of ADP. And I'm talking to other CEOs, I think this is happening kind of across. Things are just kind of settling down. That helps a lot because improvements in tenure help a lot in terms of productivity and just getting the work done. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos Rodriguez : Well, what can I say? Another disappointing quarter where no one asked about the dividend. So let me just say that if the Board -- obviously I don't want to get ahead of the Board, but if the Board approves a dividend increase in November, this will be our 48th year of increasing dividends, which I think is a pretty elite group out there. And if you look at our payout ratio and you assume the Board will want to stay in the same payout ratio, you can do the math in terms of what's going to happen with our dividend. I think people really way underestimate. I hope this doesn't become an environment where for the next 10 years people are very focused on dividends because that has its own negative implications. But if you look at over 50 years or 70 years or 100 years, dividends matter, right? And compounding growth of dividends matters a lot. If you look at ADP's return, I'm doing a little math since we went public, which is why I was bragging about this being one of the most successful commercial enterprises in history. And again, and all of you have the same HP 12C calculators, you do that math, it's a pretty important driver of overall returns. So I'm incredibly proud of that. Maria gets to be the person who will preside over the celebration, again, forward-looking statements assuming we get there, of reaching 50 years, which will make us a dividend king. And I think there's only like less than 15 companies that have accomplished that, and some pretty incredible names. So that's the only thing I want to talk about was the dividend and the one last comment I have is what I've always said, and I'll say it again, I'm incredibly grateful. I'm grateful to my team. I'm grateful to Maria. I'm grateful to the Board. But the people who really get all the work done are the people on the front lines here at ADP, the 60,000 associates that make everything happen for us. There's something that Henry Taub put in the water that has created this culture, a can-do culture of delivering consistent results, not just from a financial standpoint before our clients. I think it's just fundamental to what we do to our DNA. And I'm so proud of our associates in terms of what I've seen them do throughout my career here at ADP, but particularly over the last three years, which were unbelievably challenging. And I know many other companies and many other employees of other companies stepped up to the plate. So I know that we're not unique, but I don't know what I know, and I only know the people I know, and they're great people doing great things every day for our clients. And that -- doing that is what has delivered the results that you guys enjoy as investors. So never forget that it all starts with our associates. I thank you for listening. This is my last earnings call after 44 of them. And like I said, I won the Super Bowl, and I like the analogy to the Dolphins. I'm not sure that I had a perfect season ever. I made plenty of mistakes, I learned from them and made myself and ADP a better and stronger company, but I definitely feel like I have one of those Super Bowl rings on. So I may have to go buy something a little bit bigger in terms of jewelry, so I can brag about it. But thanks again for listening to me all these years, putting up with me. And as I said, to our leaders and to our associates that I remain their servant leader, I remain your servant leader now moving on to becoming a shareholder and also to a Director. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Michelle and I'll be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Second Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. After the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Danyal Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Danyal Hussain : Thank you, Michelle, and welcome everyone to ADP's Second Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. Participating today are Maria Black, our President and CEO; and Don McGuire, our CFO. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call. During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these items, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release. Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. I'll turn it over now to Maria. Maria Black : Thank you, Danny, and thank you, everyone for joining us. ADP delivered strong Q2 results headlined by 10% organic constant currency revenue growth; 120 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion; and 19% adjusted EPS growth. We continue to deliver exceptional value in the HCM market as we invest in ourselves and innovate to continuously meet and exceed the changing needs of our more than 1 million diverse global clients. I'll start with some highlights from the quarter. In Q2, we drove very strong ES new business bookings growth, which included an incredible finish in December. We have continued to see robust demand across our downmarket portfolio and our ES HRO offerings and our international sales performance, especially our GlobalView platform was much stronger in Q2 after a softer Q1. Overall, we are pleased with our sales results for the first half of the year, and although clients are still dealing with a number of uncertainties, our pipelines are healthy, and we feel well staffed, and well positioned to deliver solid bookings growth for the remainder of the year. Our ES retention was once again a source of outperformance with modest year-on-year improvement in Q2 overall despite continued normalization in down market out of business rates. This strong result was just shy of the record retention set during the pandemic and was led by our mid-market, our upmarket, and international businesses. And we're pleased to be taking our full year guidance up slightly. Our pays per control metric was 5% for the quarter, decelerating slightly from Q1 as we had anticipated. Job growth in the U.S. labor market has been slowing, but clearly remains solid, which you see reflected in our client base. Despite recent headlines noting job cuts by number of companies, we have yet to see broad-based softening in the labor market. Last, on our PEO, our growth in average worksite employees was solid at 8%. While we have been expecting growth to decelerate over the course of this year, the pace was a bit faster than we previously assumed and we're adjusting our outlook accordingly. With that said, demand for the PEO solution remains healthy. The secular growth opportunity is unchanged, and we are well positioned to reaccelerate our worksite employee growth. Stepping back from the quarter, I want to provide a quick update on our broader strategy. Over the last several years, you've heard us talk a lot about the modernization of our products. Our simpler user experience enhances ease of use for our key platforms like RUN and Workforce Now, and enables a more seamless integration to complementary solutions like insurance, retirement and payments. Our Next Gen Payroll engine is a prime example of how we're modernizing the back-end of our solutions, and we continue to offer it to a broader set of new mid-market clients. And brand new solutions like Roll in our Next Gen HCM platform position us to address certain HCM opportunities more fully than before. These product enhancements are designed to drive win rates and retention even higher, and we have tremendous opportunity in front of us. But our strategy has always been about much more than just offering HCM software. ADP clients want us to help them find, hire, pay, engage, and provide for the retirement of their workers in a thoughtful and compliant way. To truly solve for these needs, we are modernizing all aspects of the client relationship. That starts with product, but also extends to our go-to-market approach, how we onboard our clients, and even how we advise and support them on critical issues. We refer to this collective effort as our Modernization Journey. And as with our product journey, the opportunities here are incredible. We are removing friction and enhancing the client experience in many ways. In our U.S. down market, we continue to digitally onboard tens of thousands of clients every year, making onboarding easier for our clients and accelerating time to start. We have seen this success in the U.S. and we're beginning to scale the same capability in Canada. Our Intelligent Self-Service capability launched only last quarter is already helping a portion of our client base answer millions of questions from client employees through a completely automated process. And now in our international portfolio, we're implementing chatbots to reduce work for those clients as well. We continue to invest in our robust partner ecosystem, cultivating deep relationships and integrations with financial advisers, CPAs and benefits brokers to provide a seamless experience for our mutual clients. And we're using the power of our extensive data to deliver insights to bring greater value to clients from better aligning pays to market trends, to reducing the frequency and severity of workers compensation claims, to identifying tax credits and other legislative incentives. To bring this large-scale Modernization Journey to life, I'll speak to one of our fastest-growing businesses. ADP retirement services, which helps employers establish and administer retirement plans. Businesses today face a complex environment with significant legislative change and our clients look to us to help them navigate these changes, stay compliant and address talent challenges. For example, in the retirement space specifically, the recently passed SECURE Act 2.0 alone has over 90 provisions for businesses and employees to consider. And what we've designed makes life easy for our clients and partners, improves the financial wellness of their employees, and sets us apart in the market. Our robust 401(k) solution with thousands of different investment options is not only clean and intuitive, thanks to our new UX framework, but is also deeply integrated with RUN and Workforce Now. Our highly tenured, licensed, retirement services sales force understands our clients and understands which solutions to make a meaningful difference in a client's unique talent strategy. To expand on our partnerships with financial advisers, we recently developed a platform called Advisor Access, much like the Accountant Connect platform we developed for the CPA community years ago. This positions us better to serve our mutual clients and their employees. And our tax credit team, full of experts in their field, is there to help our clients or their CPAs apply for, and obtain the appropriate legislative incentives. Our goal in our Modernization Journey is to consistently improve the full end-to-end experience for our clients and their employees, which will in turn contribute to our long-term sustainable growth and profitability. We look forward to keeping you updated. And now over to Don. Don McGuire : Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some more color on our results for the quarter and update you on our fiscal '23 outlook. Overall, we had a strong Q2 on both revenue and margins. If I can summarize, we had generally positive developments in our ES segment despite some incremental headwinds. Meanwhile, trends were a little softer than expected in our PEO. Let me focus on ES first, and I'll cover our results and outlook all at once. ES segment revenue increased 8% on a reported basis and 10% on an organic constant currency basis which was a good outcome for the quarter. Maria mentioned the strong new business bookings performance in Q2. Given the continued macroeconomic uncertainty, we think it's prudent to maintain our current guidance range for now, although, we feel well positioned for the back half. We also had near-record ES retention in Q2, with first half ES retention results up year-on-year, we're now revising our outlook and we expect retention to be down only 20 basis points to 30 basis points for the full year. This continues to assume normalization in out-of-business losses in our downmarket. Pays per control were in line with our expectation in Q2, but with better line of sight on Q3, we are now assuming less of a deceleration in pays per control over the back half than we did previously and are raising our outlook to now assumed 3% to 4% pays per control growth for the year. And on FX, we had about two percentage points of revenue headwind in Q2, but the outlook for the rest of the year is slightly improved, and we now expect full year headwind somewhere between 1% and 2%. Those are the bigger positive developments in ES revenue. There were few developments in the other direction as well. Client funds interest revenue was up nicely in Q2, but was actually a bit lighter than we had planned. This is primarily because yields pulled back slightly from where they were three months ago when we provided our prior outlook. We're also tweaking down our balance growth assumption now to 4% to 5% growth for the year due primarily to assumptions around average wage related to worker mix, tax rates as well as the impact of the lapping of the payroll tax deferral. Together, we are lowering the full year by $5 million at the midpoint for revenue and $15 million at the midpoint for net impact to our earnings. We also saw underperformance in some of our volume-based businesses like our recruitment outsourcing business and our employment verification business. Overall, though, we're feeling good about our ES revenue growth trajectory and are taking up our guidance by 1% to now expecting growth of 8% to 9% for the year. Our ES margin was up 170 basis points in Q2, which was in line with our expectations and there was no change for our full year outlook. As a reminder, we've invested in headcount in sales, product and other areas throughout the organization over the last several quarters as we see continued opportunity to win new clients and further increase satisfaction with existing clients. And although we may scale back as appropriate, at a high level, we feel comfortable with our staffing levels against the secular growth opportunity in front of us. Moving on to the PEO. We delivered 11% PEO revenue growth in Q2 with 8% growth in average worksite employees. As Maria shared, the PEO results came in a bit softer than expected. The PEO business continues to benefit from long-term tailwinds, but there was a lingering effect from the pandemic, which is still adding variability to our PEO results and outlook. We are, for example, lapping very strong results on retention, bookings and same-store pays. And while the overall trends are playing out consistent with our expectations, we continue to refine our assumptions about pays and magnitude. With that said, we still see a continued solid demand environment in the PEO and the team remains focused on reaccelerating worksite employee growth. For this fiscal year, we are lowering our PEO revenue outlook to 8% to 9%, driven by growth in average worksite employees of about 6% to 7%. PEO margin in Q2 was up 130 basis points about in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect PEO margin to be flat to up 25 basis points for fiscal 2023. Adding it all up, the favorable revision to our ES revenue outlook is largely offset by our lighter PEO revenue growth forecast. And so we continue to expect consolidated revenue growth of 8% to 9% in fiscal '23. We also maintain our outlook for adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 125 basis points to 150 basis points. We still expect our fiscal 2023 effective tax rate to be about 23%. And we continue to expect adjusted EPS growth of 15% to 17%, supported by our steady share repurchases. I'll just make one quick comment on cadence. We expect consolidated revenue growth to be relatively steady in Q3 from where we were in Q2. We expect margin expansion to be a bit more modest compared to what we experienced in Q2, closer to 50 basis points to 75 basis points of expansion. There were a few reasons, including the lapping of a onetime item last year, comparisons from a headcount perspective, and certain investments in sales and marketing that we're assuming for Q3. Again, there's no major change contemplated for the full year, but hopefully, this helps you think about Q3. Thank you, and I'll now turn it back to the operator for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. On PEO, you mentioned the lingering effects from the pandemic is having an impact. But I was just curious, is the macro environment and I guess, labor market trends impacting PEO differently than ES? Is there more -- is it a question of sensitivity to small versus large market clients? Is it vertical exposure? Or is this really something you see is as quite transient? Maria Black : Thank you, Ramsey. I appreciate the question. So I'll try to cover all the ground on the PEO that you asked about. So specifically, what we saw with respect to the first half, we did see, as mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did see that booking did come in softer. We saw that retention came in a bit softer as well than our expectations. In terms of the lingering effect that we cited, all of our businesses had an impact from the pandemic. I would say the PEO is probably the one that had the most impact. If you think about all the drivers that constitute the PEO, it's everything from average wages to worker mix to paid unemployment to certainly the lines of insurance, workers' compensation and health benefits. So I would say it's the business that had the most impact as the pandemic came into the business. And as the pandemic gets flushing out, it is having a lingering effect on the business. I think you touched on what we're seeing with respect to pays per control in the PEO in the context of ES. But I would say is, pays per control is -- the growth rate is decelerating in the PEO. That was expected. If it contributes to the slighter softer performance in the first half and is contributing to the second half. But the two main drivers really behind the performance in the first half as well as the outlook for the second half are bookings and retention. One thing I would say, though, because I want to go back to the strength of that business. We have incredible faith in that business as it relates to the growth from a long-term outlook perspective. The demand is still there. In absolute form from a bookings perspective, the PEO did have growth year-on-year, albeit it was softer than ES and softer than our expectations. Ramsey El-Assal: Got it. That was super helpful. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up for me. Tech layoffs have been -- tech sector layoffs have been in the headline recently. I know you guys have a very diversified business, but I thought I'd ask anyway. How exposed are you to that particular vertical? Are you feeling any kind of acute impact from all those headlines kind of layoffs in the technology sector? Don McGuire : Yes, Ramsey, it's a good question. I think it's hard to avoid all the headlines that we're seeing day in, day out. And it's fair to say that there's been a number of large names that have announced major layoffs, I'd also with the -- tough to say that some of those clients are -- or some of those people making those layoffs are our clients. But those layoffs are happening around the world in some cases, they're not necessarily our clients in all of our markets. So I think it's fair to say that we have yet to see any significant impact from all those announcements. And I guess I'll just round it out by saying, we're still seeing stronger or strong demand. We've taken up our pays per control assumption for the back half. And we're doing that not just on our own internal perspective, but we're also looking at the BLS reports, the JOLTS reports. Everywhere you look continues to suggest that there's still strong demand for employment. Unemployment continues to be very low. Unemployment applications are still in record lows. They're not increasing. So the macro environment continues to be very, very favorable for us, irrespective of some of those headlines that we're seeing. Ramsey El-Assal: Perfect. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Eugene Simuni with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Eugene Simuni : Thank you very much. Hi, Maria and Don. I wanted to ask about ES bookings. So it sounds like a positive commentary, strong performance there. I think you called out international as coming back strong versus last quarter and also downmarket. Can you talk a little bit about the mid-market? How are the trends there? And yes, I think the key question in everybody's mind is, are you seeing any signs of macro pressure on bookings as companies potentially pulling back their tech spending? Maria Black : We were very pleased with our overall new business bookings for the second quarter. Definitely saw an acceleration in pipelines. I'll get the pipelines in a minute. I did cite the downmarket, the strength that we're seeing in the downmarket, that's really our entire downmarket portfolio. So thinking about our -- obviously, our RUN offering, but all the things that tether off of the RUN offer, which is the retirement services that I spoke to at length during the prepared remarks, Insurance Services. We did see strength in Employer Services HRO. And then last but not least, one of the other things that I was most pleased to see was the bounce back in international in the second quarter, both in pipelines as well as results. And that was, as mentioned really in our GlobalView space. So very happy with the results, very happy with the strengthening of pipelines. That's what gives us confidence, stepping into the back half as we think about heading toward our guidance of 6% to 9%. In terms of -- I think you also wanted to know about the mid-market because I didn't cite that specifically. We had very solid yes, very solid mid-market sales, and we continue to see the demand there as a byproduct that is certainly not getting easier for anyone to be an employer, both from a legislative perspective as well as a talent perspective. We have incredible strength in that business as it relates to the product investments we've made. So think about user experience to what we're attaching with the Next Generation Payroll engine. So we made good product enhancements. We had strong NPS. We have incredible retention results. So the mid-market in general had also a solid sales performance. What I would say is, as you contemplate the mid-market, don't forget that Employer Services HRO, the offer that we call Comprehensive Services fits squarely in that market, and that's an area that experienced tremendous growth during the pandemic, and that growth has sustained and is exceeding the overall Employer Services growth. So altogether, the net results for the mid-market are very, very solid for us. Eugene Simuni : Got it. Got it. Very helpful. And then a quick follow-up for me on pays per control. Your number was very strong this quarter we thought, out from your expectations. But also keeps outperforming by 1 point or 2, kind of the broad measures of labor market growth in the U.S. like nonfarm payrolls. Remind us what's the driver of that? And how sustainable is that as the overall labor market slows down? Can you maintain that one to two point premium? Don McGuire : Yes, it's a good question. But just to remind everyone that, that number is really a mid-market number. So we focus on the mid-market when we provide that pays per control number. And it has been strong. As I mentioned in the earlier answer with respect to the macro environment, the labor market continues to be strong. We're continuing to see our existing clients add employees. As Maria said, bookings are strong. And I think it's the kind of the $64,000 question about how long the labor market can continue to grow. Unemployment can stay so low as we look at some of the headlines and will those things start to converge at some point in the future. But for now, I think we're comfortable with what we've done in terms of taking up the pays per control growth for the back half. Danyal Hussain : And Eugene, just to your point about that spread, having existed in the past, I think typically, we would have expected 2% to 3% pays per control growth in normal economic environment, and that compares to maybe 1% to 2% total employment growth. And that's a function of our clients in general being perhaps a bit healthier than the overall economy, but also the fact that total labor includes things like bankruptcies and new business formation. So it's a slightly different take on employment. Eugene Simuni : Got it. Very helpful. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. James Faucette : Great. Thank you so much. I wanted to quickly just revisit a little bit, I think you touched on it. But retention and it's an area where we had at least been expecting to see some normalization but -- especially from a company perspective, but it seems to continue to improve or tighten. Obviously, you made technology advancements, et cetera, but what are some other areas, if any, that you'd point to -- that are helping drive that retention performance. Maria Black : Sure. Thanks, James. With respect to retention, we are very, very pleased by the strength that we've seen year-to-date. We cited, at the end of the first quarter, we had record retention. The second quarter was near record. If you look at the first half, it was a record. So we're very proud of the -- not to be a broken record, but the record retention and the strength that we saw -- and we believe that, it is a byproduct of the investments. I alluded to the investments we've made into the mid-market, as an example of the user experience. That's broad-based now across the RUN platform, our mobile app, our international offer, where we're also in international seeing record retention. So we believe a lot of these things are anchored in just really driving a better user experience, driving the product into a better place. I think the other is NPS. We have strong service results that's broad-based across the portfolio. I think we generated a tremendous amount of goodwill and value during the pandemic and how we chose to service our clients. And I think that value is -- has continued, and we see that in the results on the NPS side. So I think that's another place. You did touch on normalization. I think it's an important point to make. We do believe at this point, specifically in the down market, I think we even touched on it during the prepared remarks. We do believe that retention has normalized. When we normalize for average or adjust for average size client, we are back to the downmarket really having out of business and bankruptcies back to fiscal '18, fiscal '19 levels. So we do believe that the downmarket has normalized. So again, back to kind of the broader retention picture, it is a very strong one for us because we believe at this point, that is broad-based. And it's really a result of the investments and the service levels that we offer. James Faucette : So Maria, that's an interesting point that you're already kind of at least what you think were -- where we should be from a attrition perspective, et cetera, at least compared to where we were pre-COVID. What are you seeing now from the competitive environment, especially, as we see companies expressing more concern. Are you seeing flight to quality versus some of the regional players or newer entrants? Is that helping you? Just love an update of how the competitive environment factors into what you're seeing overall? Maria Black : The competitive environment is certainly -- on one hand, I could say it continues to evolve. On the other hand, I would tell you, if there's nothing really new to report. I think what we're seeing and we look very closely at our balance of trade, we look very closely at our win rate. We're measuring all these investments that we make and whether or not they're impacting things such as our balance of trade and such as our win rate. And what I would offer is that, there is a direct correlation between the places we're investing, whether that's the downmarket and our go-to-market brands, headcounts or in the mid-market into the product and the next-generation suite and the win rates that we have. And so we do believe that we're getting stronger in terms of our offer. And I think the record retention is a direct correlation to that. James Faucette : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open. Mark Marcon : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maria, you mentioned there was a modernization initiative. I'm wondering if you can expand a little bit on that, just in terms of what we should expect over the next six to 18 months in terms of new offerings or increased offerings. And how would that end up impacting both from a revenue as well as from expense perspective? How should we think about that? Maria Black : Sure. I love speaking about the investments we're making into the Modernization Journey. And so perhaps, I can offer the story around the next generation and how we're thinking about the impact of that over the next 16, 18 months from a revenue perspective. And maybe, Don, if you want to cover the margin side. So Mark, as it relates to our overall modernization initiatives, there is all the things that I talked about in the prepared remarks, which is around tools, technology, removing friction, taking work out. Last quarter alone, we talked about Intelligent Self-Service, Voice of the Employee. So these are bespoke features, functionality that were layering into our offers, and into our platforms to make them more competitive and bring more value to the market. With respect to the next generation platforms, I touched briefly on Next Generation HCM. We've given updates of that over time. And I think we continue to see us implement our backlog, continue to build scale, build implementation. Our goal would be -- to use your time horizon over the next 16 to 18 months that we would open the aperture to have that suite specifically sold across a broader set of the upmarket clients. In terms of the Next Generation Payroll, which is what we are offering attached to Workforce Now in the mid-market. We continue to make progress on Next Generation Payroll, pretty excited about that progress from a quarter perspective. Every quarter, there's an increase of the number of clients that we are attaching the Next Gen Payroll towards Workforce Now. So I think from Q4 to Q1, we had more. From Q1 to Q2 -- or Q2 to Q1, we had more. As continue again to attach more and more, we're running about 30% to 40% attached. So again, using your time frames over the next 16 -- six to 18 months, our goal would be to continue to more broadly offer and scale that offering across specifically, our mid-market. We're seeing, again, great signs on win rates, things like that. I think the other initiative I would speak to is Roll. Very excited about our project that we -- or it's not project, our product that we call Roll, which is really the downmarket product that we're offering to an incremental buyer that digital native. And so again, it's exceeding all of its project milestones. We're learning. We're continuing to understand how a digital buyer wants to consume payroll end-to-end in a digital capacity. And we believe over the next six to 18 months that we will learn more and as such, we will scale it across. In terms of the impacts to revenue, I would tell you, revenue over the next six to 18 months, I'm not sure that any of those projects will make a meaningful impact to the revenue. They certainly will make any meaningful impact to bookings. And as we onboard those clients, that will generate new revenue lines for us, whether that's an upmarket, our Next Gen HCM, it's a broader piece to the mid-market, our Next Gen Payroll. And then in the downmarket in the micro market that Roll addresses, it take a lot of units for it to make a meaningful revenue impact to the broader ADP. But that's the -- the excitement is really in the offers, and offers being able to drive win rates and retention and changing the competitive narrative. So with that, I'll kind of stop and I'll let Don speak to any margin impact. Don McGuire : Yes, Mark, I'll just follow up on Maria's comments. I think the adoption of these products is exciting and doing well. And as we have the adoption increase quarter-to-quarter, we expect to see improvements in revenue from these new offers. But I think at the same time, the penetration rate within our 1 million existing clients is going to take some time to achieve. So the margin impacts from those new sales and those clients is going to take some time to make its way through to the bottom line, so to speak. But I would say that we -- you've heard us often speak about transformation of these calls over the last few years. And I would say that internally, I think our biggest transformation exercise, our biggest transformation opportunity is coming from these new products themselves. So we are excited about these new offers, and we do think they're going to -- they're going to help us out in the future. Mark Marcon : That's terrific. Thank you. And then obviously, in the headlines, everybody is concerned about what could potentially occur from a macro perspective in terms of, if we go into a recession, ADP has obviously got a stellar long-term track record of navigating successfully through recessions. But I'm wondering, what's your philosophy going to be Maria, if we go into a recession in terms of thinking about expenses, margins, et cetera. Would you just focus on the long-term or would you do things in a short-term manner to adjust expenses? Maria Black : We do have a recession playbook, if you will. I think the first thing that happens is, we adjust things such as our go-to-market. When you think about how we address talent needs on the way up in an economy, it's kind of the converse on the way down. So that's not to suggest that the business wouldn't be impacted. The things that would be impacted are things like bookings. And the reason I bring that up is, it is somewhat self-adjusting, right, as it relates to the action. So in the absence of bookings, there is also the absence of expense. So some of that self-adjust, thinking selling commissions, overall incentive comp. We could also, as a byproduct of that, if there's lower volume on the sales side coming in, we would have lower volume on the implementation side and potentially lower volume on the service side. And so there will be, maybe a pullback in hiring things of that nature. And these are all playbooks that we've run before, a few times in my lifetime. We may add that juncture, choose to prioritize key investments differently, depending on what's happening. But we're going and we're very committed to continuing the work we've been doing on Modernization and on transformation. And I think one of the big lessons for us whether it was this most recent pandemic downturn, if you will, an event or it was the last -- the financial crisis or even the -- I've been here long enough to be a part of the 2000, call it, dot-com, et cetera, bust. And what I would say is, our investments in growth will be maintained. I think that's the key is ensuring that we make smart decisions during a downturn so that when we come out of the downturn, we're positioned to execute quickly. I think we made some very wise decisions, specifically, on the go-to-market, on the seller side during the pandemic that allowed us -- we were lucky because it was short and steep and fast. And as everything opened back up, we were well positioned to take advantage of that market because of the investments that we continue to make. So to answer your question, I think most of the changes that we would make are somewhat self-adjusting in their nature, if bookings were impacted. Mark Marcon : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Your line is open. Bryan Bergin : Hi. Good morning. Thank you. First one I had is on pricing. So just any change in view around ES pricing, any change in claim acceptance to the higher levels that I think you were contemplating when you entered the fiscal year, just given the macro? Don McGuire : Yes, Bryan, thanks for the question. I think it's a relatively short answer. The fact is our prices are holding well. As a matter of fact, I would say that we are kind of at the high end of the guidance we gave previously, and we're comfortable with that. I think if we look at our retention, we look at our NPS scores, it appears that those price increases have been understood and accepted as well, as could be expected. Bryan Bergin : Okay. Good to hear. And then on the international front. So can you just talk about what you saw in Europe here that drove the better performance in the quarter. And you cited U.S. pays per control here in the earnings material, what does that imply in the Europe base? So I'm curious not just on the employment level but also the demand, whether there's really any particular solutions that drove that better performance or different underlying behavior in that base versus U.S? Maria Black : We were very pleased by the improvement that we saw in international bookings. It was driven mainly by our GlobalView offer and a bit of our in-country business. So very excited about what we saw specifically, as it relates to performance in the second quarter. But also about pipelines, right? So a quarter ago, I was on this call citing that we believe that there was some pipeline depletion that happened specifically in international. So pipelines that were pulled into last fiscal year. International was one of the businesses that had an incredibly strong fourth quarter finish. And so we did see a need during the first quarter to rebuild pipelines. The great news is those pipelines were rebuilt and we saw that execution in the second quarter. It's also what gives us optimism as we head into the back half. So very excited about international. And as optimistic as I am, it is an area that we're still continuing to watch for all the obvious things, I said. Last quarter, which is, there's still the crisis in the Ukraine. There's still the energy crisis. It is also an area that we see a tiny bit of pipeline aging. And so international remains a watch item for us, albeit, very excited about the pipeline build and the results in the second quarter. And I think you asked about pays per control in international? Danyal Hussain : Yes. Bryan, pays per control for our international pays tends to be more subdued than what we have in the U.S. in both directions. And so early pandemic, it didn't fall very much at all. And in the recovery, subsequent, we had less growth there. So that's continued. Don McGuire : Yes. So just maybe -- so the government programs that are in place and the kind of the social aspect, if you will, of European employment means that things don't go down very quickly. And as a result, they don't recover very quickly as well because they don't have much to recover from. So that's a good for consistency, if you will, continuity of earnings. So that's -- that works in our favor in these -- when times are trying. Bryan Bergin : Okay. Makes sense. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tien- Tsin Huang : Hey, thanks. Thanks so much. Sorry, hope you can hear me. Maria, I think I heard you say you were looking to reposition PEO growth. If that's the case, can you elaborate on that? I'm just trying to think if the implied second half growth in WSE volume within PEO, that's a good number to start from. As we look to next year, could growth get better or worse from there? Or how quickly can the repositioning, benefit of the volume outlook? Thank you. Maria Black : The comment that I made was really about bookings. And so we are looking to reaccelerate bookings in the back half. For PEO, as mentioned, it was a bit softer in the first half. In terms of the question of when we anticipate the reacceleration, the well-positioned reacceleration and worksite employee growth, we don't anticipate that it will be in the next couple of quarters. So not a position to necessarily give guidance for next year. But we are lapping -- as mentioned in the remarks, we are lapping record retention, record bookings. And as some of that lapping happens, we believe we're well positioned to reaccelerate works on employee growth into next year. Tien- Tsin Huang : Got it. Perfect. Thank you. And then just on Retirement Services, since you mentioned it, in your prepared remarks. Any update on penetration there across the major lines? And if there's any change in the outlook or the model there. Thank you. Maria Black : Sure. So it's safe to say that business is outperforming its targets. It has great growth. We do have -- and last week, we talked about it, we do have 125,000 plans across that business. It's primarily an SMB space, a little bit into the mid-market and even upmarket. But nonetheless, if you just think of it in the SMB context and with the new SECURE Act and -- which is the 2.0 version of the 1.0 and all the state mandates. At this juncture, we have 125,000 of 800,000-ish RUN clients that take advantage of the offer. So you can kind of think about the opportunity in that way. That's not to suggest that every single one of those RUN clients could be a retirement plan, but even if we were to capture a bit of that. We do believe, and it's part of the reason I'm so excited about it is because it does continue to outperform its growth targets. And we believe there's tremendous runway for growth in Retirement Services over the coming years. Tien- Tsin Huang : Thanks for that. Operator : Our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is open. Samad Samana : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask one on the volume-based parts of the businesses that you mentioned, particularly on the employment verification. I was just wondering if you could help us understand how much did that contribute? And what are the assumptions going forward? Are you assuming that there will just be less activity around employment verification? Or do you think it was just seasonally lower? Just how should we think about that since you called it out this quarter. Don McGuire : Okay. So let me talk about the two volume businesses that we referenced in the prepared remarks. The first one would be the RPO business, the recruitment outsourcing. That business was down and that business is not a very big business for us. And most of it is focused in the upmarket. Most of the clients we have there are in the enterprise space. And I think that is an area, of course, where we are seeing something internally that correlates more with some of the headlines that we're seeing in the press. But it's not a very big business for us, and it did come down. On the employment verification business, of course, mostly and significantly related to the mortgage market. We don't share the number that EV business is part of our broader $1 billion comprehensive services business. It's meaningful for us. From a revenue perspective, it's more meaningful for us, if you will, from a margin perspective because it's above-average margin business. Hence, we called it out. But our expectations as we look forward is, we do expect there to be softness in the mortgage market in the back half of the year. And we've reflected those expectations and those forecasts into the numbers that we're sharing with you today. Samad Samana : Great. And then maybe just a housekeeping question on the rate side. So just so we understand it. When the company gives the forward outlook for the float revenue guidance. Are you assuming -- I'm assuming the tenure that's come in at the short end of the curve has actually gone up. So is it -- should we assume that the tenure at current levels is what you're now forecasting going forward? I'm just trying to -- we're just trying to make sure that we get it correct, the inter-quarter moves and how we should think about that on the guidance of that. Don McGuire : Yes. So since we presented -- since we gave guidance last quarter, rates have come down, particularly on the mid and the long rates. And even though short-term rates have increased, some of our short-term borrowing costs in our commercial paper program. So the rates that we're giving and the reason we take in our client fund interest forecast down a little bit at the midpoint, is to reflect those increased borrowing rates and the softening, if you will, of interest rates in the mid and the longer term. Danyal Hussain : Yes. Samad, thanks for asking that question because I know we take a slightly different approach than some of our peers. But even when you think about the short end of the yield curve, what is currently baked into market expectations is also what baked into our outlook for the year. So even if the Fed raises rates, that does not necessarily suggest upside to what we had previously guided. And to Don's point, at the longer -- the mid and longer end of the yield curve, you actually saw a decline. And so we share in our earnings release the incremental yield on new purchases and that declined from, I think, 4.3% last quarter to 4.1% this quarter. So in other words, we're getting less in the mid and long end of the yield curve, and we're getting more or less what we expected in the short. Samad Samana : Great. That's helpful. Thanks for clarifying that. Appreciate it. Operator : And our last question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open. Jason Kupferberg : Hey, thanks, guys. I wanted to come back on PEO for a second and maybe piggybacking on Tien-Tsin's question. Just as we think about the second half of the fiscal year. It looks like the revenue growth is going to come in 5%, 6%. And then you talked about getting to some easier comps and some reacceleration. But are you thinking any differently about the medium-term guide for PEO? I think that was 10% to 12% when you provided that at the Analyst Day. Maria Black : So the medium-term guide, all of the medium-term guides were somewhat aspirational in their nature, and we're not sitting here today making changes to any of our medium-term guide. I think, again, when I think about the PEO outlook, just a reminder, because I said it earlier on the call, but I think it is an important point. The demand has been incredibly strong still for the PEO. It is still growing nicely through the second quarter. Technically was year-on-year growth. It just wasn't what we had expected, and it decelerated a bit earlier than we thought. And so when we think about kind of the back half of the PEO, we do expect bookings to reaccelerate. As mentioned, we expect works on employees to not accelerate in the coming quarters, but we're well positioned to do so as we lap the compares into next year. But I think the big piece -- by the way, even retention was healthy. Retention is right in line with really where it's been in the last decade. I spent a lot of years in that business. And I've seen this as nothing abnormal, if you will. It's really just the byproduct of some lingering effects from the pandemic, which is not that different than some of the strangeness that we experienced during ACA in that business. And so what I would say is, demand is healthy, bookings is healthy, just not as high as we wanted it to be on tough compares. Retention is healthy, just not as high as we wanted it to be, again, on tough compares. And we feel well positioned in that business to accelerate and very excited about its long-term growth opportunity for us. Don McGuire : Yes. Sorry. And at the same time, remember, at Investor Day, we said that we were expecting high single-digit growth in average worksite employees. So I think we're still very much on that track and pretty much committed to that. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. Appreciate that. Just wanted to follow up on -- so on the pays per control side, obviously, you upticked the guide there. But we have seen in the temp labor market, there's been some material declines in recent months. I'm just wondering how you guys think about the temp labor market relative to broader labor market conditions. And your business with some kind of potential lag? Just any views there would be helpful. Thanks. Danyal Hussain : Yes. Jason, I think -- Don McGuire : Sorry, I will -- let me start. Maybe Danny can add some color. I think some of the leading indicators we look at -- so look at the JOLTS report, we look at the job postings, et cetera, those still seem to be healthy. It is -- I mean, the open positions, the until positions are certainly declining, but they still remain at healthy levels compared to pre-pandemic levels. So I think that would be an indicator we look at. And I think there's still some room there before they get back to what we saw pre-pandemic. So I guess we'll continue to pay attention to it. We're focused on it. But at this point in time, things still feel to be pretty healthy. Danyal Hussain : Yes. Jason, exactly to that point. It's one of many leading indicators that we look at. And for sure, things are slowing, given where we are with employment and 3.5% unemployment rate. So it's not a question of whether we expect the monthly jobs growth to slow over the next several months, I think that's more or less assumed. But the question is, at these employment levels to get that type of growth is still a very healthy outcome. And so I think that's how we would characterize the overall environment today. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. Thanks for the color guys. Appreciate it. Operator : We have time for one more question, and that question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Kartik Mehta : Good morning. Maybe Maria or Don, as you look at the PEO business and is -- are you seeing any more competition in the business? Could that be a part of maybe you're seeing? Or is this just that you need to reposition the business a little bit and the business was so strong that the comparisons are difficult. Maria Black : I think the business was so strong. I think the compares were difficult. We plan for deceleration. It happened faster. We do not see a competitive change or landscape that exists. Again, in terms of where that business gets its business from, that 50-50 split between kind of new clients coming in as well as upgrades as well as where we actually return clients that leave. Certainly, there is PEO to PEO switching, but it's a very small piece to the overall results on the booking side or the impact on retention. And we're not seeing -- again, we look at balance of trade, we look at win rates and we do not see a meaningful change in the competitive landscape. Kartik Mehta : And then maybe Don and Danny, I know you're talking about leading indicators and Don, you talked about the JOLTS report, and I assume we have lots of other statistics. But I'm wondering, are you able to look at the customers you have and the demand they see for employees? And if you kind of compare that to what you saw three, six months ago. Are you able to do that? And if so, maybe what you might see in that type of -- those type of statistics? Don McGuire : Yes. I mean, I think the way we look at that, Kartik, is through the pays per control growth. And so as we went from 7% growth in Q1 down to 5% and we were looking to be a bit flatter in the back half, although we've become a little bit more optimistic on that as time has gone on. So I think that would be the key area where we kind of take a look and see what the demand is with our installed client base. Danyal Hussain : Yes. Beyond that, Kartik, we do have some recruitment solutions beyond the recruitment outsourcing one that Don spoke about earlier. And so we have, for example, data on the total number of job postings that our clients have. And if you were to look back, that would typically track JOLTS, the trends would be very similar. Now that said, clearly, you could be in an environment where people have job postings and then they decide to pull them. So how accurate that is, how great of a leading indicator that is, it's hard to say. But at the same time, we have live data on pays per control as Don points out. So we know with precision how many people are being added week-to-week. That's healthy. The job postings are healthy. Granted there are some signs of deceleration, layoffs and temp, but the bigger picture is still healthy. Kartik Mehta : Well thank you very much. I appreciate it. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Maria Black for closing remarks. Maria Black : Thank you, Michelle, and thank you to all of you on the phone today for your thoughtful questions. As you heard from our tone today, very pleased with the first half, excited about how we're positioned for the second half against our updated guidance. Again, everything that we do every day is all about solving for clients in the world of work. And with that, I think it'd be appropriate for me to thank the 60,000 plus associates that are out there every day doing that work for our clients, for their workers and bringing meaningful value into the world of work and into the world of HCM. So thank you to all the associates. Thanks to all the analysts and the investors for your support and your continued support. We certainly appreciate it and we look forward to keeping you updated and speaking with you again soon. Thanks so much. Operator : This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Michelle and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP\u2019s Third Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Danny Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Danny Hussain : Thank you, Michelle and welcome everyone to ADP\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. Participating today are Maria Black, our President and CEO; and Don McGuire, our CFO. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC\u2019s website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today\u2019s call. During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these items along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release. Today\u2019s call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risks. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. I will now turn it over to Maria. Maria Black : Thank you, Danny and thank you everyone for joining us. For our third quarter, we delivered strong results, including 10% organic constant currency revenue growth, 110 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion and 14% adjusted EPS growth. Our continued solid financial performance underscores the power of our innovative and mission-critical HCM solutions that serve over 1 million diverse clients around the world as well as our highly recurring revenue business model. As usual, I will start with some highlights from the quarter. The demand environment was healthy overall. And in Q3, we drove another quarter of solid Employer Services, new business bookings growth, representing a record Q3 bookings amount. Bookings performance continues to be particularly strong in our downmarket portfolio. In Q3, we sold and started over 60,000 new run clients, where a new user experience has helped us reach record level new client satisfaction rates these past few quarters. We also had strong bookings results in our insurance and retirement services offerings supported not only by legislative tailwinds, but also by the competitive positioning of our downmarket HCM ecosystem. Demand for our employer services HR outsourcing solutions remained high and we have recently reached the 10,000 client mark. We also saw continued booking strength in our compliance-oriented solutions, including tax remittance and wage payments, which have always been key differentiators for us. On a year-to-date basis, we are within our bookings guidance range and are trending in line with our expectations from the outset of the year and we look forward to finishing the year with a strong close. Our employer services retention rate came in better than expected once again. While we continue to experience normalization in our downmarket out of business rates, this was offset by the strong retention rates in our U.S. mid-market and international businesses, both of which continue to benefit from years of improving client satisfaction. As such, we are pleased to be raising our full year retention guidance. Our employer services paid for control grew 4% for the quarter and continues to decelerate at a very gradual pace. As we have seen for several quarters now, layoffs at many larger companies have been offset by the labor demand elsewhere, which in total has resulted in year-over-year employment growth. With this continued resilience, we are pleased to expect the higher end of our previous pays per control guidance range. Last, on our PEO, while growth in revenue and average works on employees continued to decelerate this quarter, we were pleased to see PEO bookings growth reaccelerate nicely in Q3, especially in March. This represented a much better performance than we experienced in Q2 and resulted in our largest quarter for PEO bookings ever. Despite the current inflationary environment and broad-based macroeconomic uncertainty, we are focused on our PEO sales execution and on delivering continued strong client satisfaction and we remain confident in the long-term secular growth opportunity. Stepping back, while we are pleased to be on track to deliver very strong full year financial results, we are even more excited about how we are leveraging our unmatched scale and decades of innovation experience to drive continued progress on our important modernization journey. We are making our solutions more powerful and easier to use and we are making our unparalleled insight and expertise more accessible than ever. In doing all this, we are delivering an experience that\u2019s better for our clients, better for their employees and better for ADP. I mentioned the tens of thousands of new clients we onboarded in our downmarket, over a third of those clients utilized our digital onboarding experience, yielding a faster time to start, happier clients and greater productivity for our implementation team. We just completed our busy year-end period during which we helped our clients with over 75 million U.S. tax forms and to further enhance the client experience, we proactively service critical year-end data to our clients before they had to search for it. This not only reduced friction for them, but also reduced the number of calls and interactions with our service teams. For years, we have directly engaged and served our clients\u2019 employees through channels like Wisely. As we focus on the overall employee experience we can offer, we continue to add valuable functionality like a savings envelope that employees have used to move more than $1 billion into savings over the last 12 months and a new financial wellness hub with tips, tools and education to drive better financial outcomes. With our new intelligent self-service solution, we are already interacting with over 3 million client employees per month through our action card feature. And our voice of employee solution is helping thousands of clients obtain better insights from their employee population, which can drive higher engagement and satisfaction for those employees. The opportunity to continue creating value and efficiency in the world of work is meaningful and we believe these modern approaches that reduce friction and exceed client expectations will help us deliver on that in the coming years. With that in mind, I want to provide some perspective on how we are strategically positioning ourselves to invest over the near-term given the economic backdrop. As we shared earlier this year, in fiscal 2023, we were impacted by higher wage inflation. We also added to our service and implementation capacity to meet the expectations of our growing client base and we invested throughout the year in sales and product. As we position for potential economic slowdown beyond this fiscal year, we are being thoughtful about how we prioritize our investments. At the same time, we are very much committed to our ongoing modernization journey, which is critical to our sustainable growth and that will require continued steady reinvestment into the business. In the coming quarters, I look forward to updating you on near-term growth priorities for ADP. Before turning it over to Don, I want to take a moment to recognize our associates for their continued focus on helping our clients through the many challenges they face each day, especially amid these uncertain times. Resiliency and partnerships represent core components of the ADP brand promise and are among the many reasons businesses around the world choose to partner with a leader in the industry. Our unrelenting support through years of growth, years of challenge and the years in between is something they have grown to count on and we are honored to support them. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Don. Don McGuire : Thank you, Maria and good morning everyone. I will provide some more details on our Q3 results and update you on our fiscal \u201823 outlook before briefly touching on fiscal \u201824. Let me jump straight into the segments, starting with Employer Services. ES segment revenue increased 11% on a reported basis and 12% on an organic constant currency basis, which is the strongest ES revenue growth we have experienced in quite some time. As Maria shared, ES new business bookings were solid and kept us on track with our full year outlook. We believe the full range of bookings outcomes is still on the table given the relative importance of Q4 bookings to our full year results. So we are not making any change to our guidance, but we do believe the middle of our guidance range feels most likely at this point. On ES retention, following another quarter of better-than-expected results, we are again revising our outlook and we now expect retention to be down only 10 to 20 basis points for the full year compared to our prior outlook of down 20 to 30 basis points. This again will be driven by retention decline in our down market from normalized out-of-business losses and is mostly offset by improved overall retention elsewhere. Pays per control remained strong in Q3 and we are raising our outlook to now assume about 4% pays per control growth for the year compared to our prior outlook for 3% to 4% growth. Client funds interest revenue increased in Q3 in line with our expectations and we are updating our full year outlook utilizing the latest forward yield curve, which in this case resulted in no major change. And on FX, we had about 1 percentage point of ES revenue headwinds in Q3 and there is no change to our outlook for a full year headwind of between 1% and 2%. Following our strong Q3 ES revenue growth, we are pleased to be raising our outlook once again to now expect about 9% growth, up from 8% to 9% before. Our ES margin increased 80 basis points in Q3, which was in line with our expectations. We are narrowing our full year outlook to now expect about 200 basis points of margin expansion and we still see significant opportunity to invest in sales, product and elsewhere throughout the organization to capitalize on the growth opportunity in front of us, which we are choosing to do at this juncture. Moving on to the PEO, we had 5% revenue growth driven by 3% growth in average works on employees. As a reminder, this deceleration is driven by a few factors, including slow pays per control growth, difficult comparisons versus record retention levels and softer recent bookings growth that we experienced the last 2 years. For this fiscal year, we now expect PEO revenue growth of about 8% with growth in average works on employees of about 6%, both at the lower end of our prior ranges. Maria mentioned the bookings reacceleration in Q3 and we are feeling upbeat about reaccelerating the revenue growth in the coming several quarters. This guidance update is mainly due to a tweak to our pays per control assumption within the PEO as it decelerated a bit more than we previously assumed, somewhat different from what we experienced in the ES segment. We are separately lowering our outlook for revenue, excluding zero margin pass-throughs to a range of 7% to 8% due mainly to lower SUI rates in Q3 than we previously anticipated. PEO margin increased 140 basis points in Q3, which was better than expected due primarily to continued favorable workers\u2019 compensation reserve adjustments, which we had not assumed as well as the lower SUI costs I just mentioned and we are raising our outlook for PEO margin to now expect it to be up 50 to 75 basis points for fiscal \u201823. Putting it altogether, we still expect consolidated revenue growth of 8% to 9% in fiscal \u201823, but now believe it will be towards the higher end of that range. We are maintaining our outlook for adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 125 to 150 basis points and for a fiscal \u201823 effective tax rate of about 23%. And we now expect adjusted EPS growth of 16% to 17% and compared to our prior outlook of 15% to 17%. I also want to provide some early high level color on what to expect for next year. We are still going through our annual planning process, but there are a few things to consider at this point. First, assuming a slowing economic backdrop, pays per control could be at a below normal growth rate next year, among other potential macro considerations. I would also point out that while client funds interest appears positioned to give us some contribution to growth, based on the latest forward yield curve, it will likely be very modest. At the same time, we have good momentum in our ES bookings performance and ES retention and we are feeling upbeat about the continued opportunity to build on our decades of success. Thank you. And I\u2019ll now turn it back to Michelle for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Your line is open. Bryan Bergin : Hi, all. Good morning. Thank you. So Don, maybe just building on those last comments you had there, I am curious just any indications or call-outs worth mentioning as it relates to fiscal \u201824? Really in the context of the medium-term outlook that you have given in the past, just how should the Street consider the magnitude of potential impacts across some of these KPIs from a potentially slower macro environment? Don McGuire : Yes, Brian, good morning. Thank you for the question. It\u2019s still early. We are still in the middle of our planning process. I think we have a lot of things going in our favor sales. We are \u2013 we still have relatively high client fund interest. Pays per control have been good and strong. Bookings continue to be strong as we said earlier. So as we get into \u201824, I think we are going to be in a pretty healthy spot with what we know today. I guess the challenge we all have is trying to guess what\u2019s coming in terms of the broader macro situation. We continue to see strong demand. Retention continues to be pretty good, although it\u2019s normalizing a little bit in the down market as we did expect. But I think things feel pretty good at this juncture. So I am going to have to ask you to bear with us a little bit as we make our way through our plan and we stay tuned to what\u2019s going on in the macro environment even closer as we get forward or closer to our July 1 beginning of the year. Bryan Bergin : Okay. That\u2019s fair. And just on the PEO, so works on employee view downtick and I think you were down sequentially in average works on employees. Can you just talk about what you are seeing in kind of the pays per control versus the retention aspect in the PEO? And with bookings reaccelerating, how long does the reconnection to improve growth take? Don McGuire : So the \u2013 we did have, as you mentioned, we had a particularly strong PEO bookings month in March, which we are optimistic is going to continue and help us as we go forward. Certainly, we are going to have to see how those bookings continue through the balance of the year, trying to anticipate how those are going to actually result in revenue. Things do start relatively quickly in the PEO business, but it\u2019s going to take some time once again to see how that stuff rolls from bookings into revenue. But we are pretty optimistic about how things went in the third quarter, especially with the finish and we do expect to see that reacceleration as quickly as we want to. And by the way, back to your earlier question a little bit, we talked about high single-digit growth in our mid-term view and we won\u2019t be happy if we don\u2019t get something like that. Maria Black : Yes. I think, Brian, if I can just comment on the quarter-over-quarter real quick as I think you mentioned the sequential growth Q2 to Q3 and works on employees. That is something that obviously we noticed as well and as Don mentioned, from a medium-term perspective, we are definitely still committed from the medium-term to the works on employee growth that we have guided to for that. However, as it relates to kind of the quarter-over-quarter, we noticed the same thing that you noticed. And obviously, that\u2019s not the ideal situation and we are hopeful that won\u2019t be the case as you look sequentially on the quarter-to-quarter, Q3 to Q4, but also year-on-year. And I think that\u2019s really a byproduct of timing and that timing is really about retention, right. So it\u2019s really about, call it, third quarter retention results, which we have cited before were a bit softer than we expected. And as a result of that, you see the sequential piece to the quarter-on-quarter. Bryan Bergin : Okay. Is that just a function of the type of client within PEO? Maria Black : In terms of the type being. Bryan Bergin : More white collar? Maria Black : I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a function of more white collar, I think it\u2019s really a function of some of the feelings that we have post-pandemic as the renewals have really been kind of, call it, rippling through the business of the PEO. So it\u2019s really a byproduct of some of the post-pandemic impact that we saw in the PEO. So it\u2019s really a byproduct of the retention softness that we saw in the first quarter, in the second quarter and then quarter-on-quarter this past quarter. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily a byproduct of \u2013 because retention continues, albeit it\u2019s normalizing a bit in the down market. We do have very strong retention in the mid-market. We also have strong retention, albeit tiny bit less than last year in the down market. So I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s a byproduct of the client base or white collar, I think it\u2019s really a byproduct of kind of a post-pandemic environment in the PEO. Bryan Bergin : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Bryan Keane : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess just trying to look at Employer Services, really strong growth in the quarter, 12% organic. If you back into the guidance for fourth quarter, it looks like a little bit of a deceleration. I think you get to something around 8% growth. So just trying to understand the puts and takes there for the fourth quarter guide versus the strong results in the third quarter? Don McGuire : Yes, thanks for the question. The biggest impact, I guess, in terms of growth would be we are going to continue to see strong growth from client fund interest in the fourth quarter. But certainly, Q3 is by far the strongest quarter just given the seasonality of tax receipts, etcetera, for us. So I think that would be one of the key drivers. And of course, we did mention as well that we expect to see pays per control growth coming down and softening a little bit, even though a bit higher than we expected to see. Last quarter, it is coming down. It\u2019s certainly starting to moderate. Bryan Keane : Got it. Got it. And then on the bookings side, although bookings were strong, I think you commented maybe towards the lower end of the range of 6% to 9% and just can you help us maybe think about how bookings will translate into future revenue growth for the employer services? If you can just remind us, just as we get our models set or start thinking about fiscal year \u201824. Maria Black : Yes. So I\u2019ll let Don comment on the \u2013 how the bookings kind of relate to the models on the revenue side. But from an overall bookings perspective, what we cited in the prepared remarks is that we do anticipate the middle of the range. So we did keep the range constant. So it\u2019s constant with the outset of the year, it\u2019s also constant with last quarter\u2019s guidance. So we are keeping that 6% to 9% range. We do anticipate at this point, the middle of that range. And we feel pretty confident heading into the fourth quarter when we take a look at how we exited March, but also taking a look at the number of sellers we have, the investments we\u2019ve made into the ecosystem and as those sellers ultimately gain tenure because we\u2019re actually lapping a lot of new hires that we had, if you will, a year ago. So pretty excited as we step in the other part of that. Confidence is really about what we\u2019re seeing as it relates to the overall pipeline. So pipelines are strong. That\u2019s more of a, call it, enterprise and international or large deal type of comment. We\u2019re seeing tremendous activity in the top of the funnel still upmarket. So the down market continues to shine for us, and that\u2019s really supported by what we\u2019re seeing in continued increases in new business formations. We\u2019re also seeing those new business formations generate inbound leads. So we\u2019re seeing good activity on the digital side. So feel confident as we step into the fourth quarter, and then I\u2019ll let Don comment on how the \u2013 ultimately where we land in the fourth quarter and how that translates into revenue for us next year. Don McGuire : Yes. So on the modeling side, roughly a 1% change in ES bookings growth impacts us in the $17 million to $20 million annually on revenue growth. So that\u2019s kind of how we think about your models. I think that\u2019s been pretty consistent. Danny Hussain : Yes. And Brian, the timing is \u2013 it depends on the business. Obviously, strong performance in the downmarket will impact revenue much more quickly. And if you have strong global view sales at the other end of the extreme, that can take several months to even more than a year, in some cases, to roll in. So, typical rule of thumb for us is a couple of quarters to see the full impact. But of course, the bookings throughout the year have been pretty consistent for us. And so I wouldn\u2019t expect any real callouts from the revenue timing standpoint. Bryan Keane : Great. Alright, thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Eugene Simuni with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Eugene Simuni : Hi, guys. Good morning. Maria, I wanted to pick back up on your comments about the break down market. Maybe elaborate on that a little bit, what are the macro factors, your competitive positioning that\u2019s still supporting that? And if you could contrast that for us a little bit with what\u2019s going on in the mid-market. I know it\u2019s still doing well. But if the question is, is there a path for mid-market to get to as strong of a point down market? And what are the levers that maybe you\u2019re able to pull to get you there? Maria Black : Absolutely. So I\u2019ll start with the down market, just to kind of reiterate the strength we\u2019re seeing there top of funnel. So we are very pleased with what we saw in the performance of the down market. That\u2019s also inclusive of the down market ecosystem. So I think this is our run platform. I talked about the third quarter onboarding 60,000 clients. It\u2019s pretty incredible. Those clients also, many of them have attach rates of our retirement services offering, our insurance services offering. So the entire down market portfolio it\u2019s definitely performing well for us and has for quite some time. It is driven by what we\u2019re seeing macro. And so you just kind of reiterate what we\u2019ve seen as new business formations are up year-on-year, 8%, by the way, they are still up year on pandemic, as I call it. So they are actually if you look at current new business formations versus the year of 2019, right? So pre-pandemic, it\u2019s actually 8,000 or so a week. This is all from the U.S. Census Bureau. So, from the standpoint of what we are seeing that kind of emanate into the pipelines and into the top of the funnel, we do have double-digit growth in our digital inbound leads, right. So I think these are at the OSEM ads, where ultimately clients are coming to us, and we\u2019re meeting those clients with our inside sellers and the demand is there, the demand is strong. In terms of the mid-market, the mid-market was a bit softer this quarter than it was last quarter. That said, we also are very excited about the pipeline that we\u2019re seeing in the mid-market that specifically call it the, the tech only, we do have strength in our Employer Services HR outsourcing offering, which also touches the mid-market. So combined, your question around, is there a path to see tremendous growth there between those businesses, we are seeing growth, and we are excited about our overall mid-market position from a competitive landscape. We do have our next-generation payroll engine that\u2019s attached to about 30% to 40% of our mid-market new business sales. And what I will tell you is it\u2019s resonating incredibly well in the market. It\u2019s resonating with the sellers. That\u2019s always a good sign when they like to talk about it and they like the demo it. It\u2019s also resonating in terms of the competitive landscape and more wins. And so we feel that there is definitely a pass. That\u2019s what we\u2019re investing in, both in product and the ecosystem to have the mid-market be as an exciting of a story as the down market is for us. Eugene Simuni : Got it. Very helpful color. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, I want to quickly come back to the PEO. Can you talk a little bit about the kind of the macro headwinds for the PEO order? I think we discussed last time, specifically the insurance attach rates, insurance premiums, kind of blocking PEO growth. Is that still a factor or not any long-term? Maria Black : Yes. What I would say is that the PEO demand remains strong. And so we\u2019re bullish about the secular tailwinds of the PEO. We\u2019re bullish about the value proposition. As it relates to benefits and benefits attached. I know there is a lot of discussions, there are a lot of surveys out there from the likes of Kaiser, etcetera, as it relates to our clients making different choices. I think what we see within our base is perhaps some asks of that. And on the peripheral kind of on the margin, perhaps there is price sensitivity as it relates to benefits. What that really allows for is for our sellers just need to be, call it, more surgical as they go to market. But in terms of the value proposition of the PEO and benefits still being a big component of that, that is the case. We skew definitely a bit more white collar in our PEO. In addition to that, our model with a fully insured model is a little bit different. And so the companies that we attract our PEO are still companies that want to be employers of choice, and employers of choice especially in a macro environment, such as this one, where talent is still the name of the game. They want to offer benefits and benefits are a piece of that. So what I would say is we are not seeing huge signs. I think even if you take a look at the revenue [indiscernible], you would be able to see kind of what\u2019s happening with benefit revenue. So there is not huge signs that there is a shift in benefits attractiveness. I think the shift that we see is just the sharpness that our sellers need to have as they position the value proposition and, call it, the right plans and the right rate to the right clients. Eugene Simuni : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thanks so much. Hey, Maria, I think you talked about 60,000 new run clients in the quarter. Can you help us dimensionalize that? Where would that typically be? And how should we kind of expect that to evolve going forward? Maria Black : So the 60,000 clients that I mentioned are specific to our down market, specifically the run platform. So that\u2019s actually 60,000 clients that we started. So where would they be? They would be all over the United States, if you will, from a \u2013 and I\u2019m not trying to be funny about it, but it\u2019s really pretty amazing effort if you think about the volume of clients, the throughput, if you will. They come to us through some of the things that we talked about today, new business formation, they also come to us through our channel ecosystem. So we\u2019ve made a lot of investments into the relationships we have with our CPAs, with our banks. In terms of what does it look like quarter-on-quarter, stating the obvious the third quarter for us is obviously the highest volume quarter. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s kind of fun to give that shout out this quarter because, arguably, I would say that\u2019s not a typical quarter for ADP as it relates to a number of units and the throughput because many of the starts do happen in January in that business. But they are kind of all over the place, and they come to us through the strength of our distribution model and the strength of our overall ecosystem. Does that answer the question, Kevin? Kevin McVeigh : It did. I guess I was just \u2013 I know Q3 is a high watermark. How should we think about 60,000 maybe relative to Q3 of last year? Was it 40? I mean, just trying to understand like how the momentum is accelerating there? And then just what\u2019s the profitability? Because it sounds like a third were digital onboarded, like the ones that are digitally onboarded, how much more profitable are those than a traditional client that\u2019s onboarded? Just trying to get a sense of if we\u2019re an inflection point in terms of the growth there. Maria Black : Yes. Listen, I \u2013 fair enough. I don\u2019t know that I meant to trip myself into giving a quarter-on-quarter number I would tell you is it\u2019s higher than last quarter. It\u2019s higher both in revenue, obviously and the performance. It\u2019s also higher in share unit volume. So I suppose I\u2019ll kind of leave it at that. In terms of the third that comes through the digital onboarding, what that yields is a few things, Kevin, one of which is better experience for the client, right? So our digital onboarded clients have very high, what we call, new business client NPS results, right? So \u2013 and when a client starts with us happier, it yields to a happier client long-term, which yields to a happier and more retentive clients. So I think in terms of what the, call it, margin profile or lifetime value of those clients look like over time, we\u2019re still learning a bit about that, but it\u2019s very optimistic for us as we\u2019re seeing the results. I think the other is it also yields efficiency for our implementation organization, right? So if you think about having the ability to have these clients digitally onboarded allows the more complex onboardings, if you will, perhaps clients are coming to us with more complications around their taxes or maybe from a competitor or something that\u2019s actually demands and implementation person to be involved at a much higher level, it allows their focus to remain there, which also should yield a better experience for those clients. So we\u2019re also seeing that. So overall, we are seeing, and I cited it in the prepared remarks, we\u2019re seeing new clients come on board happier. The digital ones are happier than the non-digital, but they are all happier than they were last year, which is a good thing for us as it relates to the retentive nature of those clients over time and what they will bring to us in terms of lifetime value. Kevin McVeigh : Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. James Faucette : Great. Thanks very much. I wanted to quickly Maria, ask a clarifying question. On the mid-market, you kind of talked about some of the things that you\u2019re doing there. But just to be clear, it sounds like from your perspective that it\u2019s more issues or things that ADP can do to address versus macro? I just want to make sure understanding kind of your list of objectives and things to do in that segment. Maria Black : Absolutely. The mid-market for us still has \u2013 and we\u2019re still experiencing solid mid-market sales, right? And so I don\u2019t \u2013 from my vantage point, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily the softness that we saw in Q3 versus Q2 with a byproduct of a macro type of environment. We\u2019re paying close attention to demand cycles. We\u2019re paying close attention to pipelines. In terms of \u2013 are there some cycles that are perhaps a tiny bit elongated, maybe, there might be some more approvals or approval layers involved, and there may be a little bit of cycle elongation. I would tell you, we\u2019re not seeing that much of that in the mid-market, and it really looks more like \u201819, it looks more like pre-pandemic than it does necessarily something that would give us a belief that there is a macro concern in the mid-market. What I would say is on the macro side, it\u2019s not getting any easier in the mid-market to be a client, right? And so if you think about the complex environment for the mid-market customers and clients, it does continue to increase. And so they are solving for hybrid work, they are solving for talent, they are starving for compliance, regulation. And they are turning to HCM providers such as us, to help with all of that. So I think the macro supports a very strong environment for the mid-market and we do continue to expect to have mid-market growth, including our HRO. James Faucette : Got it. Got it. And then I guess maybe dovetailing with that, can you speak a little bit about the competitive environment? And any changes you\u2019re seeing there? Or what are you seeing from customers? Is there a flight to quality versus maybe some of the regional players and what is the impact of newer entrants? Just can you give us kind of a state of the competitive landscape? Maria Black : Sure. I would say the competitive landscape, one way to think about it is it actually hasn\u2019t changed that much. So is there a flight to quality, sure. We\u2019ve seen some of that, but it\u2019s not material at this time as it relates to clients calling us and asking about the macro and what\u2019s happening in the world. We\u2019ve had a few of those calls just recently based on some things that have happened in the environment. But what I would say \u2013 when I think about the competitive environment, we look at this very closely. We just completed our strategic plan process, and we\u2019ve been looking at our competitive position against all the major players, mid-market and others over the last handful of years in a surgical way. What I would offer is a few items, one of which is we have strong retention, specifically in the mid-market. We also have very strong retention in international. We have a near-record highs in NPS. And so I would say that our value proposition and our competitive positioning \u2013 it\u2019s proof, if you will, if you look at the retention, from a balance of trade, we are also winning more away from our competitors than we have in years past. And so again, I think our position is about the same when I look at it year-on-year, but it\u2019s getting perhaps a little bit better on the wind side. And I think that a lot of that does have to do with the quality that we\u2019re providing, so inside kind of the NPS results. Certainly, the investments we\u2019ve made, the investments into our organization to serve our clients better. Some of the things I talked about, new products that we\u2019re leveraging, the likes of AI to actually drive self-service, to drive better experience for our clients, their employees and drive friction out. So I would say, investments into product. And then lastly, again, investments into new products that is creating better wins for us. James Faucette : That\u2019s great. Thank you so much for that color, Maria. Maria Black : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Kartik Mehta : Don, I know you gave preliminary FY \u201824 guidance. And one of the things you talked about is obviously pays for control moderating. But do you think \u2013 could there be an offset because inflation is still running high and there is a pricing opportunity for the company, especially on the payroll side? Don McGuire : Yes, Kartik, it\u2019s a good question. So certainly, talked about pays per control growth decelerating. We called that out. And we\u2019ve also \u2013 I mentioned earlier, for \u201824, I think there is a risk that it decelerates further. So we will have to watch and see what happens there. On the inflation side and pricing, we\u2019re still in the early days of our FY \u201824 plan. So we\u2019re watching it carefully. I think we can say that we are happy with the impact of the results of the price pricing decisions we took in \u201823. We had those readily accepted, I guess, with \u2013 reflected by our higher NPS scores by our continued strong retention. So we have an ability to take price. But as we always come back to, we\u2019re in this for the long haul with our clients, their long-term retention is the most important thing to us. So we need to make sure that we continue to have that good value proposition between what the absolute prices, how much price we can take, etcetera. But once again, Kartik, it\u2019s definitely something we\u2019re looking at and trying to evaluate as we get closer to putting the plan to bid. Kartik Mehta : And then, Maria, just on the PEO side, could \u2013 is any of the attrition related to maybe customers deciding that they had a PEO and it just got too expensive for them. So they have decided to move out of the PEO for a while until they can get a better understanding of what\u2019s happening in the economy. Any changes like that? Maria Black : I would say that\u2019s always the case. I think every year, as we go through renewals, as we go through the year-end cycle, you have clients that are choosing to buy into the PEO and you have clients that are choosing to exit the PEO. When I look at where we get our clients from, obviously, I think we\u2019ve cited multiple times that about 50% of the new business that comes into the PEO comes from our existing ADP base that would suggest that at least 50% come from a non-PEO environment, and we somewhat tend to return them the same way. So that\u2019s not to say that clients don\u2019t, at times, we don\u2019t trade customers between us and the other PEOs. But generally speaking, I think that\u2019s always the case. I don\u2019t believe there is a larger trend toward that this time than there has been in the past. I think, really, in the end, it\u2019s really a byproduct again of kind of what we saw with the renewal post pandemic and what the impact of that as we headed into this selling cycle, if you will. Kartik Mehta : Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I also wanted to follow-up on the PEO and particularly on the bookings reacceleration. I\u2019m just curious how much of that reacceleration is sort of from a better kind of external demand environment versus changes in your sales strategy? I\u2019m just trying to figure out how much is sort of push versus pull when it comes to that recovery. And I guess the underlying question is your confidence level that this reacceleration is a sustainable trend? Maria Black : Fair. Thank you, Ramsey. We are excited about the PEO reacceleration, specifically what we saw in March and obviously, how we feel stepping into this final stretch. I think it is too early to comment on the finish, but the pipelines are strong. What I would tell you is that I\u2019m bullish about the demand in the market for the PEO and the overall value proposition. So all things being equal, I think we\u2019re positioned well as anybody else as it relates to the overall PEO, I guess, demand, if you will, right? So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a \u2013 the reacceleration was really, in my mind, more a byproduct of top of funnel filling the pipeline. We made a lot of investments into our seller ecosystem and the PEO. We have incentives that we can pull. In addition to that, we\u2019ve invested into \u2013 and I think I\u2019ve talked about it a couple of times on these calls. We\u2019ve invested into artificial intelligence that actually looks across our base to a project where we are actually looking at the ADP base to try to serve up the right, call it, PEO seller at the right time to the right ADP clients. So we\u2019re getting smarter. I am not doing a good job saying it outside of we are getting smarter in terms of who we are actually targeting on the PEO using technology today that didn\u2019t exist. So, I think all of that has kind of yielded to what I would say is a strong execution by the PEO sales team to drive the reacceleration that we would expect and that we are excited to see and optimistic that it will continue. Ramsey El-Assal: Okay, great. And a quick follow-up, when you look across the business, are you seeing any vertical-specific areas of softness maybe tech or commercial real estate or financial services? Are there any worrisome kind of verticals that you are keeping an eye on? Maria Black : Are you referring to the PEO specifically or the overall macro? Ramsey El-Assal: I know. I should have been more clear. Just more broadly across the business, are there any \u2013 you guys have a pretty broad macro view. And I am just curious if there is any specific areas that are causing any concern in terms of recent trends? Don McGuire : Yes. Maybe I will jump in. I think in terms of verticals, certainly seeing all the reports and reading all the things about commercial real estate that everyone else is. That\u2019s \u2013 we look at the breadth and the distribution of our client base, it\u2019s pretty broad. So, I am not so sure that we are seeing any particular verticals that are causing us any undue concern at this time. I would say, has been reported, Maria mentioned it in the prepared remarks, certainly, the enterprise space, the up-market space is where there has been a lot more layoffs announced, etcetera particularly in tech. So, we are looking at that. We have said in the past though that\u2019s not the biggest part of our business. So, even though there is some more softness in that end of the market, it\u2019s being more than offset by the success we are having in the down in the mid-market. So, from a particular vertical, nothing in particular. Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. Thanks. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is open. Samad Samana : Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe first one, Maria, just I wanted to maybe get a better understanding when you are talking about a change in maybe the investment \u2013 investing philosophy of the company just as you are adjusting to the macro environment evolving as well. Is that more around maybe pulling back on hiring? Is that more about maybe redirecting where resources are? Can you maybe just help us better understand what that translates into? And maybe how we should think about that impacting both the top and bottom line? Maria Black : Yes. Thanks Samad and good morning. I am happy to talk about modernization. It\u2019s one of my favorite topics as all of you are probably learning from my prepared remarks. And I think it\u2019s important to think about the modernization journey we have been on and how it really can set us up for kind of future growth and future margin, if you will, as a company. And that\u2019s really what it\u2019s all about for us. I think we have been undergoing transformation. We have been undergoing modernization for years. I would actually suggest that ADP has been modernizing for the last 73 years as we have invested in technology to make things better for us as a business to become more efficient, and we have been investing in our clients and in product to make it easier for them. And so I think that\u2019s not a new cycle. The way I think about modernization is really a client first lens, right. So, it\u2019s really about all the things that I cited. It\u2019s about taking out friction. The way I think about the investment, which is your question, Samad, is it\u2019s an imperative for us to continue to invest in modernization because it\u2019s the modernization that over time has really allowed us to reinvest in growth and reinvest in the business. And we are committed to a continued journey of growth and margin. And as a result of really the way we have been able to do this. So for us, it\u2019s really about both. It\u2019s really about the end, right. So, it\u2019s about growth and margin expansion. And I think this virtuous cycle that we have been on really as a company for a very long time, which is we make things easier, we make them better. We become more efficient. We make things better for our clients, and that allows us to invest in growth and it allows us to invest in \u2013 back into our shareholders, if you will, in margins. So, it\u2019s really an end story and it\u2019s key to who ADP is and it will be a key for us as we go forward. In terms of the commentary that I made around how we are thinking about it and the macroeconomic backdrop, it is an important time to make sure we are making the right choices and the right trade-offs. I mentioned earlier, we have been in the middle of our strategic planning process the last quarter. And as we have gone through the business, if you will, end-to-end, rest assured that we are trying as a company to make the very best decisions to have the very best outcomes as it relates to growth and margin. Samad Samana : Great. I appreciate that. And then just one quick follow-up for Don, I was just looking at the guidance by segments and the margin for ES, it looks like you have settled it out at the \u2013 within the range at the lower end. I am just curious maybe what drove that? Is that \u2013 is it purely float contribution driven, or is that more the result of just bookings being better, so expenses being pulled forward? Just help me understand why that was narrowed to the lower end of the range, please? Don McGuire : Yes. I think there is a couple of things going on. One, certainly, we are continuing to benefit from bookings growth, retention, price pays per controllers all a little bit stronger. And we certainly are getting lots of tailwinds. We have lots of tailwinds in Q3, in particular, from client fund interest. So, that\u2019s been very helpful for us. The things slow a little bit from a client from an interest perspective in Q4. So, that certainly is not as helpful as it was. And we are of course, as Maria just mentioned, we are taking advantage of some of those extra flow funds that we have to invest \u2013 reinvest in the business or continue to invest in the business on modernization. So, it\u2019s all about I think trying to find the right balance and still delivering the \u2013 as we mentioned, higher end of the earnings per share prediction or guidance. So, it\u2019s all to find the right balance, and we will continue to invest in modernization and deliver improvements as we go forward. Samad Samana : Great. Appreciate taking my questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning. Could you walk through the 140 basis points of PEO margin expansion in Q3? It seems pretty notable given the deceleration in PEO revenue growth. And in particular, could you unpack the size of the workers\u2019 compensation reserve release in Q3? Danny Hussain : It was $17 million. You will see it in the Q compared to $7 million last year. So, it wasn\u2019t a huge amount. Don McGuire : But those are the two impacts. So, the biggest impact was the reserve adjustment on workers\u2019 comp. And the other big item there is the lower SUI costs. So, there is virtually no margins on SUI. So, SUI comes down at the top, it certainly improves the margins. So, those would be the two major impacts on the margin improvement in PEO. David Togut : Got it. And then just as a follow-up, Don, could you walk through your strategy on managing the tax filing float going forward? We have got a pretty steeply inverted yield curve right now, which means it\u2019s actually more expensive for you to borrow in the commercial paper market and invest flow medium-term duration bonds. Are you thinking of shifting the investment portfolio at all in the year ahead? Don McGuire : We have had that strategy in place for some 20 years or so. And we have realized about $2.8 billion of incremental benefit from that strategy. And so we have a strategy in place. We always revisit these strategies and look at them. It\u2019s true that the yield curve is inverted for the seventh time in 50 years. How long that continues, not sure. But we will continue to look at that strategy and see what we need to do, if anything, to change it as we go forward. But it is something we have been committed to and we followed closely. Near-term, certainly we have benefited this quarter because of the inflow of funds in calendar Q1, there is a big balance or a big benefit there to us. So, as we go forward, we will continue to look at the opportunities and decide if we need to make any material changes to the investment strategy. Danny Hussain : David, one point worth clarifying because this has come up before. If you look at the last slide of our earnings presentation, you will see a disaggregation of client short extended and long. And one thing I think is worth emphasizing is that we are net long exposed to the client short. In other words, if short-term interest rates went up and up and up, that would actually be beneficial to our earnings and our margins. It just shows up in two different places, which can often cause confusion. But it\u2019s actually not hurtful to us to have these higher borrowing costs because we have more dollars invested long in the client short portfolio. David Togut : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open. Mark Marcon : Very good morning everybody. Maria, you talked about modernization. Can you talk about the areas of emphasis? And one area that I am particularly interested in is international and what you are seeing there in terms of opportunities? Thank you. Maria Black : Sure. So overall, I think modernization is really about end-to-end. So, think of it as product and continuing to make investments in ensuring our products are next generation, if you will. And that\u2019s certainly the case across many pieces of our portfolio, and you are well aware of the investments we are making in next-generation technology. I think product is a big piece of it. I think other is the internal modernization. So, that would be everything from go-to-market to call it, the seller ecosystem modernization. I think I have spoken to that quite a bit in the past as well as how we actually serve our clients. And again, we reference that today. So, kind of going back to modernization specifically in our opportunity in international, we are very excited about our position in international, very excited about the opportunity that we have. And this is definitely an area that we have been modernizing. So, if you think about each and every country that we serve over 140 countries today that we have offers over time, we have been modernizing the platforms, and we have been consolidating platforms. But to your point, Mark, that work is not done. And so we still have that journey that we have been on is the journey that we are going to continue. But as we do that, we are also focused on ensuring that we continue to make the investments to the platforms, and we continue to make the investments into the overall ecosystem of how we serve our clients international to really drive further, call it, opportunity. And so there are still places in international, and I will probably leave it with, we will be back next quarter to talk more about things such as our growth strategy. But I think as it relates to international all of that modernization should also yield a growth opportunity for us because it\u2019s still a big world and there are places that we \u2013 even though we are in more countries than anybody else, there are countries that we don\u2019t exist, there are segments within certain countries where our offer still has opportunity. And so we were incredibly excited about the overall international space where we are, the work that we are doing and where we are going. Mark Marcon : That\u2019s great. And Maria, can you talk a little bit about just what the appetite is? And obviously, it\u2019s diverse across the globe. But broadly speaking, are you seeing a greater level of interest in terms of modernization of HR and HCM systems across the globe? Certainly has been an ongoing trend in the U.S. for quite some time. But just I am hearing from others that there is a pickup in terms of RFPs that are occurring things of that nature and that we could be at the early stages of higher levels of growth, international macro notwithstanding? Maria Black : What I would suggest, Mark, is that over the last few years, the conversation in the international space has definitely shifted a bit, and I could suggest the same thing, which is that it\u2019s picked up. And so that conversation today tends to lead with more of a global offer, global system of record kind of conversation. So, we walk in today and we have a conversation with a client more often than not about how many countries are you in and where can we help serve you and how can we tie it all together to make an ability for that client to really see across multiple countries and have more of a unified experience versus, I would say, perhaps 5 years, 10 years ago, it was more of a country-by-country conversation. Today, it\u2019s more \u2013 it starts with a multi-country conversation. And so I think all of that suggests, but it appears you have heard from others, which is the narrative in the international is shifting. I think there is greater demand for HCM offerings in international as it relates to companies now that are more global than they have ever been. And certainly, the hybrid environment has accelerated that a bit. And the ability for companies to be able to see their workforces and make talent decisions, headcount decisions across multiple countries. That\u2019s a very different conversation today than it was just a few years ago. And we see that when we have, we just recently, actually, this quarter, we had all of our international clients together at an event. And the topic is about their transformation. It\u2019s about their HCM transformation and the partnership that we have with them to solve for them. And I think the beauty of ADP is that we have the ability to solve the MNC, the multi-country piece. And we also have the ability to solve the in-country. And a lot of times, for clients, it\u2019s a mix of both. And so it\u2019s really about the flexibility we have in our partnership options to serve these clients in a very unique way. Mark Marcon : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have time for one more question. And that question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tien- Tsin Huang : Hey. Thank you so much and you covered a lot already. I just wanted on the down-market side, given the success in the bookings here. Just curious if that\u2019s changing your thinking and investing more or even less, maybe in ASO versus PSO then the digital sales versus the seller ecosystem? I am curious as we are going into fiscal \u201824 here, if there is any maybe change in thinking in prioritization there? Maria Black : So, we have leaned into the down market in terms of the investments we have made. So, when I think I referenced earlier the seller headcount as we head into the final stretch here and how pleased we are with the investments we have made in headcount and the ecosystem around them, so investments into the channels, things of that nature. And as all of that turns into more productivity because the headcount is actually gaining tenure. It is primarily setting those investments have been in the down-market. So again, think our SPF platform, the retirement services, insurance services, most of that also comes into our digital sales organization, also known as the inside sales. So, we are making investments into inside sales to really serve the down market. And what I would suggest is that from our viewpoint at this point, the demand is there. We have leaned into that demand and we will continue to lean into the demand to drive the growth that we are driving out of the down-market as long as it exists, if you will. Tien- Tsin Huang : Yes. No, I am glad to hear it. If you don\u2019t mind one more question. Just I have to ask you since you mentioned Maria with AI. We have been getting a lot of questions on generative AI and ChatGPT. You mentioned being smarter around serving up PEO when necessary at the right time. But just broadly speaking, how are you thinking about generative AI and how that might help you run your business better, both from a sales perspective, but also from a delivery perspective, support standpoint? Maria Black : Yes. Thank you, Tien-Tsin. I am actually \u2013 I am thrilled you asked this question because I was counting on it during this call because it definitely seems like it\u2019s the topic du jour. But the real answer is, just like everybody else, we are incredibly excited about generative AI. We have been very excited about AI for quite some time. You mentioned what we have been doing for our sellers in the PEO, that\u2019s broad-based work that we have been doing for a long time and continued to invest in AI into making us more efficient. That example is about our sellers. We are making similar investments even with the new technologies that are out there to really look at how we can make our service associates as well as our sellers more productive. So, you think about all the things that an agent, if you will, does today to support a client and some of the generative AI tools that can drive a different level of efficiency. And we are very excited. We have I think it\u2019s something around like 44 different work streams that are underway currently to take a look at different ways that we can leverage these tools internally. That\u2019s also notwithstanding the opportunity that it creates for our industry, right. So, if you think about the HCM industry, there are still very many things inside of HCM that are administrative in nature in terms of whether it\u2019s job descriptions, performance reviews, things that are maybe handbook, things that are very tactical that really a time pulled back the practitioner from doing what they want to do, which is be a strategic partner. And so we are really excited to put these tools also into our product for our clients and our practitioners to be able to lean into. So, all that said, we are very excited about the opportunity. One thing I would point out because it\u2019s important, and it\u2019s also very topical right now, which is that the good news is we have been doing a lot of this work. And as such, we have standards. We have a way to think about the ethical nature and that kind of comes at parity with who we are, given that we have the big data, if you will, behind ADP and the 40 million wage earners that we pay. And so when we think about all of this, also with the lens of doing it the right way and making sure that it\u2019s applicable, it\u2019s secure, it\u2019s compliance, all the things that you would expect from ADP. But no doubt, Tien-Tsin, that we are excited about the opportunity it creates for us internally and the opportunity that it creates for us and our product to really serve the industry, right, and make this entire industry that much more strategic and not much more exciting. So, great question. Tien- Tsin Huang : No. Hope to learn more soon \u2013 talk soon. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Maria Black for closing remarks. Maria Black : Thank you. So, first and foremost, thank you everybody for joining today. Really appreciate the questions and the interest. As you can imagine, I sit here one quarter into my new role as CEO and I get a lot of questions. Just last night, I got another text that said, how were the first 100 days, how is the first quarter, what have you been up to? And here is what I would offer. The third quarter for ADP, and you heard it in my tone today, you have heard it in my excitement about some of the volumes and the throughput, but the third quarter is really where you see ADP shine. And it is our finest quarter. You have year-end, you have busy season, you have selling season that all kind of come together. In this quarter, what I would say is adding some economic strangeness and questions about what\u2019s happening in the world, and I would say that sitting here one quarter in, I couldn\u2019t be more excited. I couldn\u2019t be more pleased. I couldn\u2019t be more grateful for the share execution of our associates. So, I felt the breadth and depth of ADP this quarter at its finest. And with that, I just want to take another minute to thank our associates for everything that they do to power this great company. I would also like to thank all of our partners and stakeholders and everyone on the call listening today. I couldn\u2019t be more proud and more excited about this company. And with that, we will wrap up the call. Operator : This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Michelle, and I'll be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. After prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Danny Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Danny Hussain : Thank you, Michelle, and welcome everyone to ADP's fourth quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. Participating today are Maria Black, our President and CEO; and Don McGuire, our CFO. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter and full year. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call. During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these items along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release. Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. I'll now turn it over to Maria. Maria Black : Thank you, Danny, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. We closed out the year with a strong fourth quarter, that included 9% organic constant currency revenue growth, 270 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion, and 26% adjusted EPS growth, and for a full year fiscal 2023, we delivered 10% organic constant currency revenue growth, 130 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion and 17% adjusted EPS growth, representing another strong year for ADP. I'll start with some highlights from the quarter. Our worldwide sales and marketing team delivered exceptional Q4 Employer Services new business bookings growth that was well in excess of our expectations, with strong double-digit overall growth on top of a difficult comparison. The HCM demand environment has been healthy despite a gradually slowing macroeconomic backdrop and we have been capitalizing on this steady demand. Our strong bookings results were broad-based. We had continued strength in our down-market and Employer Services HRO offerings. We also had better-than-expected results in our midmarket, as well as a great finish from our compliance and international businesses. This Q4 performance brought our full year Employer Services bookings growth to 10% compared to our 6% to 9% guidance and our medium-term goal of 7% and 8% growth that we laid out at our 2021 Investor Day. We are, of course, thrilled with this result and excited to keep the momentum going. Our Employer Services retention rate was another highlight in Q4 and came in better than we expected. For the full year, we delivered a retention rate increase of 10 basis points and are back to our record level retention rate of 92.2%, all while absorbing the impact of normalization in the down-market out of business rates. This strong result was driven by record level retention rate, specifically in our U.S. midmarket and international businesses, and by record level overall client satisfaction across our major businesses in the fourth quarter. Our Employer Services pays per control growth was 3% for the quarter, as the overall labor market continued to show resilience, bringing the full year pays per control figure to 5%. We have been pleased all year to see such durable labor demand from our clients. And last, while our PEO revenue growth performed in line with our expectations this quarter, we were pleased to experience a further acceleration in PEO bookings with strong double-digit growth in Q4, representing another record level sales quarter. Moving on, while Don will cover our fiscal 2024 financial outlook, I wanted to spend a few minutes sharing our strategic priorities as we look ahead. Change and increase in complexity are secular growth drivers for the HCM industry and our breadth enables us to address nearly any HCM challenge our clients may face and meet them wherever they may be on our HR journey. From start-up to enterprise, from software-only to fully outsourced, and from local to global, we see a tremendous growth opportunity in front of us. And while our specific growth initiatives will vary by business, there are three key strategic priorities, which apply across all of ADP, that I see is critical to enabling our growth in the years ahead. The first strategic priority is to lead with best-in-class HCM technology. Put simply, our goal is to design, develop, and deliver the very best and most innovative solutions that will help our clients navigate the full lifecycle of employment from hiring employees to onboarding and training them, providing insurance for them, paying them, and filing payroll taxes, and even setting them up for retirement. As much as we offer today, we see an incredible opportunity to improve on our current and next-gen solutions, tactically use partnerships and inorganic means to further accelerate our pace of innovation and continue to offer industry-leading HCM products. And we expect to have a busy fiscal 2024. For U.S. small businesses, we are rolling out several product enhancements that will serve our 850,000 RUN clients, including a new tax ID registration service, learning management to help with small business employee training and an insurance and sector tool that utilizes AI to help clients manage their workers' compensation insurance policies and annual audits. For U.S. mid-sized businesses served by Workforce Now, our focus is to continue our great momentum in the deployment of our Next Gen Payroll and time engine and to drive our win rates and client satisfaction even higher. In the U.S. enterprise space, we expect to nearly finish the migrations of three of our remaining legacy platforms by the end of this fiscal year, representing an important step in our multi-year journey to move our clients to more modern platforms. We are also pleased to have advanced the velocity of our Next Gen HCM implementations and we expect our Next Gen HCM sales to contribute in a more meaningful way to our bookings growth in fiscal 2024. Outside the U.S., we intend to scale our iHCM midmarket platform in fiscal 2024, adding at least 1,000 clients over the course of the year. I am also incredibly excited to share that we will begin offering role outside the U.S. in fiscal 2024 to drive incremental growth. We plan to launch initially in two countries in Europe and expand its reach from there. And we intend to continue growing our Asia-Pacific business in part by leveraging our recent acquisition of a strong midmarket time product to supplement our existing payroll functionality. And across a few of our platforms, including Workforce Now and Roll, we intend to deploy GenAI-powered features to help our clients more quickly and easily tackle certain HR transactions. Our second strategic priority is to provide unmatched expertise and outsourcing to our clients. We pride ourselves on serving as a true partner to each and every one of our one million clients. Our culture of client service applies equally across our entire business from a basic payroll client to a fully outsourced client where we run part or all of the HR department. Our expertise and partnership approach has been key to ADP's winning formula for decades, and we will continue to lean into it. We expect that to manifest in a few ways in fiscal 2024. We have recently been piloting a number of tools powered by GenAI that can help our service and implementation associates deliver an even better client experience, and we will begin deploying these more broadly in early fiscal 2024. Given the significant number of clients we onboard and interact with every year, we expect to learn quite a bit this year about the longer-term benefits we and our clients might realize from GenAI. Meanwhile, demand for our HR outsourcing solutions remains very strong, and in fiscal 2024, we are focused on reaching new clients and further improving the experience for existing ones. Our Employer Services HRO businesses have been performing incredibly well and our focus for fiscal 2024 is to continue delivering strong bookings and keep client satisfaction and retention at current levels or perhaps even reach new record levels. And our focus for our PEO business in fiscal 2024 is to maintain our recent strong bookings momentum by continuing to add to our sales force headcount, grow our referral partner network and use data and machine learning to identify existing ADP clients who maybe a strong fit for an upgrade. Our third and final strategic priority is to leverage our global scale for the benefit of our clients. Our size and scale are unmatched in the industry. Across the globe, we not only offer robust platforms and a commitment to industry-leading service and expertise, but we also provide a scaled ecosystem and a unique on-the-ground presence in over 30 countries. This combination positions us to interact routinely with local governments and tax authorities, meet stringent certification and data requirements, and stay on top of complex and shifting legal requirements. Globally, we bring together our incredible data, an array of partners and integrated solutions, and one of the biggest and best business-to-business sales forces in the world to help our clients and prospects navigate the changing world of work. In fiscal 2024, we will continue to build on that scale for the benefit of our clients. Our GlobalView platform support hundreds of the world's largest multi-national companies with scaled workforces in over 40 countries and our Celergo platform helps us serve thousands more in up to 140 countries. In fiscal 2024, we expect to expand on both as we add additional countries to GlobalView's broad reach and as we potentially make tuck-in acquisitions to enhance our native in-country footprint. After establishing an ADP in-country presence in five new markets in 2023, we expect to expand further in fiscal 2024. Our world-class global scale distribution led by over 8,500 sellers is being supported by headcount and marketing investments in 2024, and as we've shared with you in the past few quarters, our sellers will continue to be paired with a best-in-class sales tech stack, which we plan to enhance with GenAI functionality in the coming months. And our ability to provide data-driven insights will continue to grow in fiscal 2024. ADP serves more clients and pays more people around the world than ever, and as we continue growing the number of employees we serve globally, the power of our insights will likewise continue to increase and benefit our clients. I am incredibly excited about these three strategic priorities for ADP and the differentiation and growth they will continue to drive. But before turning it over to Don, I wanted to take a moment to recognize our associates for their effort and performance over the course of this year. Our associates embody our core values, like insightful expertise, service excellence, and being results-driven. In fiscal 2023, ADP was recognized as the World's Most Admired Company by Fortune Magazine for the 17th consecutive year, signifying the incredibly strong culture we have and the important role we play in the world. Additionally, we were recently recognized, for the first time, as one of the Best Companies for Innovators by Fast Company, a true testament to the direction we are headed in. We owe these accolades as well as our strong consistent financial performance to the commitment and effort of our 63,000 associates that make-up the ADP family. With that, I'll turn it over to Don. Don McGuire : Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by expanding on Maria's comments around our Q4 results and then cover our fiscal 2024 financial outlook. Q4 performance is very strong overall, driving fiscal '23 results at or above our expectations. As Maria mentioned, these results reflected broad-based strength in Employer Services and PEO new business bookings, better-than-anticipated Employer Services retention and continued healthy Employer Services pays per control growth, yielding 10% organic constant currency revenue growth for the year and bringing us to $18 billion in revenue. For our Employer Services segment, revenue in the quarter increased 11% on both the reported and organic constant currency basis. This stronger-than-expected revenue growth was a function of continued outperformance in retention and pays per control growth as well as a better-than-anticipated contribution from client funds interest. Our ES margin expanded 480 basis points in the fourth quarter, which was broadly in line with our expectations. For the full year, our ES revenue grew 10% on a reported basis and 11% on an organic constant currency basis, and our ES margin expanded 190 basis points. Growth in client funds interest helped us in a year in which we added a fair amount to our product, service, and sales headcount, which has driven some fairly substantial benefits in sales, Net Promoter Score, and retention results. For our PEO, revenue increased 4% for the quarter, decelerating slightly from Q3, as we anticipated. Average worksite employees increased 3% on a year-over-year basis to 722,000, and has started to gradually reaccelerate, supported by very strong bookings growth in Q4. PEO margin contracted 110 basis points in the fourth quarter, in line with our expectations due in part to higher selling expenses. For the full year, our PEO revenue grew 8% and average worksite employees increased 6% and our margin expanded 60 basis points, all in line with our most recent guidance. I'll now turn to our outlook for fiscal '24. While the economic backdrop remains uncertain, we continue to believe we are well-positioned to deliver solid overall financial results, while also investing for future growth, consistent with the strategic priorities that Maria laid out. Our fiscal '24 outlook assumes a moderation in economic activity over the course of the year, but nothing dramatic. Beginning with ES segment revenue, we expect growth of 7% to 8% driven by the following key assumptions. We expect ES new business bookings growth of 4% to 7%, representing a solid growth after a particularly strong fiscal '23. For now, we're assuming a stronger first half and some moderation in second half bookings growth, which we think is prudent, given the limited visibility into the macro environment. For ES retention, we finished fiscal '23 at a record level of 92.2%, consistently outperforming our expectations throughout the year. We are, of course, very pleased with this performance as we overcame headwinds from higher down-market out of business levels with strength elsewhere. With that said, we are contemplating a 50 to 70 basis points ES retention decline for fiscal '24, due in part to an assumption that small business losses will increase slightly from where they are today as well as an assumption for general impact to our other businesses from a slowing economic backdrop. As we called out three months ago, we see the potential for below normal pays per control growth in fiscal '24 and our outlook assumes 1% to 2% growth for the year. We had a strong Q4, which gives us a solid starting point for growth and a gradual deceleration over the course of the year feels reasonable at this time. And after price contributed 150 basis points to our ES revenue growth in fiscal '23, we are anticipating a smaller contribution in fiscal '24, though still above our recent historical average contribution of around 50 basis points. And for client funds interest revenue, the interest rate backdrop has been dynamic these past few months, and is important to keep in mind that our client funds interest revenue forecast reflects the current forward yield curve, which will, of course, evolve as we move through fiscal '24. At this point, we expect our average yield to increase from 2.4% in fiscal '23 to 2.8% in fiscal '24. We, meanwhile, expect our average client funds balances to grow 2% to 3% in fiscal '24, this is a bit lower than recent trends, due primarily to more modest contribution from pays per control growth and an assumption for more moderate wage increases. Putting those together, we expect our client funds interest revenue to increase from $813 million in fiscal '23 to a range of $955 million to $975 million in fiscal '24. Meanwhile, we expect the net impact from our client fund strategy to increase from $730 million in fiscal '23 to a range of $815 million to $835 million in fiscal '24. For our ES margin, we expect an increase of 130 to 150 basis points, driven by operating leverage and contribution from client funds interest revenue, offset by continued investments across our strategic priorities. Moving on to the PEO segment. We expect PEO revenue and PEO revenue, excluding zero margin pass-through, to grow 3% to 5% in fiscal '24. The primary driver for our PEO revenue growth is our outlook for average worksite employee growth of 3% to 4%. This represents a gradual reacceleration from the 3% growth we're stepping off in Q4. Strong bookings performance has already contributed to accelerating client growth, but that has so far been offset by slowing pays per control growth. With continued strong bookings growth, our worksite employee growth should gradually accelerate as well. And as Maria shared, demand has been healthy and we remain confident in the long-term growth opportunity in PEO. We expect PEO margin to be down between 20 and 40 basis points in fiscal '24, due to anticipated higher selling expenses, as well as year-over-year headwind from a lower workers' compensation reserve release benefit than we experienced in fiscal '23. Adding it all up, our consolidated revenue outlook is for 6% to 7% growth in fiscal '24 and our adjusted EBIT margin outlook is for expansion of 60 to 80 basis points. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal '24 to be around 23%. And we expect adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 12%, supported by buybacks. One quick note on cadence. At this point, we expect total revenue growth to be relatively consistent quarter-to-quarter. We expect our adjusted EBIT margin to be down slightly in Q1 on a year-over-year basis, and then build over the course of the year. Thank you, and I'll now turn it back to the operator for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open. Owen Callahan : Hi, this is Owen on for Ramsey. I appreciate you taking our question today. I was just curious more on kind of your PEO revenue guidance. I know you called out worksite employee growth weighing on growth there, but you expect double-digit kind of bookings growth and projects only 3% to 5% growth in PEO revenues for fiscal '24. I was just curious if you can provide any more color on that spread is any conservatism or if there are any other factors to consider there. Thank you. Don McGuire : Hi, Owen, thanks. Yes, I'll answer the question. We had a very, very strong sales bookings result in Q4. So we're very happy with that, and we've seen the sales reaccelerate. I think as we said in the prepared comments, we are seeing continued growth in clients. I think if there is a challenge that we're facing a little bit as we're seeing a little bit softer pays per control growth in the PEO than we would have expected. But back to what we've been saying for some time, we think the underlying value proposition is very, very strong and we look to that business continue to grow for us and be a big part of our portfolio. Owen Callahan : Understood. I appreciate that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is open. Samad Samana : Hi, good morning. Congrats on the strong end to the fiscal year. Maybe first question, Maria, I thought it was - is very interesting about the announcement of moving Roll into new international markets. How should we think about maybe what the opportunity there looks like? How much different is the complexity around payroll processing in international markets versus the U.S. and have you included that in the bookings forecast for fiscal '24? Maria Black : Yes, fair enough. Thanks, Samad, and I appreciate the congratulations on the quarter and the year. We're, obviously, pretty proud over here. So with respect to Roll, it is exciting. It's been an exciting product for us to rollout, no pun intended, across the down-market here in the U.S. We're excited to take it into international. As mentioned, the initial goal is to put it into two countries. And it is an incremental add for us because it's really initially into these two countries. We're thinking more kind of the down-market SMB space, which is an area of opportunity for us across many of the markets that we serve. But we're also excited about Roll long-term beyond that space. So excited to dip it into our international space as we continue the overall rollout of Roll. In terms of factoring it into the overall bookings, not really. I think the - by the time the launch happens and as we're thinking about the full year for our international business or full year for new business bookings, I'd be surprised if it ultimately makes a dent, but to us, it's really about the long-term value that that offer will bring as we seek to expand the addressable market for us into these various places. Last but not least, Samad, you mentioned the complexity of being international. And I have to tell you, I spoke to it a little bit in the prepared remarks. There's a lot that goes into being in each one of these countries. To your point, there is complexity country-by-country. Many countries put many of the states that are complex here in the U.S. to shame in terms of the complexity that provides, and that's everything from government entities, legal and tax attorneys, who's the tax authority and how do you get to them. We often think of it as an ecosystem. We think about it as kind of that final mile, if you will, and that's the complexity and that's what we've been building over the last couple of decades in our international business. So it's a lot more than dropping off software at a country border and hoping that it works. There's a lot to be said for the ecosystem around it. Again, whether it's tax authorities, data lodgement, things of that nature. So excited to take advantage of the footprint we've built and put in our product into that footprint as we expand Roll internationally. Samad Samana : Very helpful. And then maybe just a quick follow-up for Don. I know you gave - you called out that broad-based strength that drove the bookings upside and you cited several specific factors. I guess, it would be helpful if you could maybe help us dimensionalize where the upside was relative to the company's own expectations at maybe the start of fiscal '23 and what you're carrying forward from what you saw in the fourth quarter into the FY '24 bookings outlook? Don McGuire : Yes, thanks for the question. I'll start here and I think I'll turn over to Maria for the bookings. But we certainly saw strength across the Board. I think once again, in the prepared remarks, we called out the - our tax business and our international business. So they were very strong amongst all the ones that were strong and the down-market was also quite strong. So it was really a contribution from across the Board in the fourth quarter. We talked for some time about how the pipelines are healthy and whatnot, and you had questions before about times to get signatures on deals, et cetera, things came together in the fourth quarter and we were very, very pleased with the final result. Maria Black : That's right. My only add to that comment would be, we stepped into the quarter with healthy pipelines, with a strong staffing position that was growing tenure. I have to tell you when I reflect on all the quarters that I've watched across our sales execution, generally speaking, you have a bunch of businesses that are outperforming and you have a few businesses that are perhaps being carried by those that are outperforming. What I have to tell you is, this was a broad-based strength across the entire organization sales implementation service with kind of an all-hands-on-deck execution, and that's really what it's all about. What I would attribute it to is incredible execution. Samad Samana : Great. Thank you. Appreciate you taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Bryan Bergin : Hi, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to follow-up on U.S. bookings here. So you cited several areas of strength, midmarket compliance, international. On the midmarket, specifically, can you talk about what's driving that better-than-expected performance, do you think that's driving improved competitive performance versus kind of rising tide environment? And then just - I heard your comment on Next Gen HCM contributing more in the current fiscal year to bookings. Maybe talk about the initiatives in the product development that you think is going to drive that. Maria Black : Good morning, Bryan. So I'll comment on both. The mid-market strength that we've seen and coming in a bit better than expected. It's been solid for quite some time. That's inclusive of our HRO offerings, and as you know, we've been speaking to those quite a bit in terms of the resonance of that value proposition in the market. So I think that adds to the overall strength that we have in the mid-market, which is the various flavors and offers that we have. I think the other is that we've made tremendous investments into that business. So we do have our next-generation payroll engine that the sales force is pretty excited about and we're seeing that in the wins that are coming in and just kind of the momentum there. I think the other is the amount of product investment and innovation that we've done in the mid-market, specifically referencing the investments we've made into the Workforce Now platform with the new UX and many of the things that I've been speaking to. And I think the other call out is it definitely helps on a new business bookings perspective, when the business on the other side, so service and NPS, if you will, as well as retention are firing on all cylinders. And that's exactly the case. We have record retention in our mid-market, and we have near-record MPS results across the mid-market. So really, really proud of the execution in that entire space. And that definitely fuels and feeds the ability for our sellers to get excited about everything that I just mentioned to go-to-market. Stepping into the question around next-gen HCM, I did make a reference to that. We've talked a lot over the last quarters about this year. And what we've been working on is scaling implementation, and that's exactly what we've done in that business. So, we were able to onboard a lot of the clients, that we had on our backlog. We've shortened the time of implementation, and we also saw additions to that backlog. So, we saw new sales in the fourth quarter of that next-generation HCM platform. We're really excited about the momentum as we step into '24. And as such, we believe that Next Gen HCM will be a larger contributor to bookings for us in the upcoming years than it was in '23, but we were pleased with what we saw in the fourth quarter and the momentum heading in. Bryan Bergin : Okay. Understood. And then just on pricing, can you comment on where that ended up in fiscal '23 and what you're assuming in ES growth from a pricing standpoint in fiscal '24? Don McGuire : Yes. So, we were happy with our price increase and retention. So as we've talked to many times, we want to make sure that we're not getting greedy. So, we did get about 150 basis points of price in the year. And we did that without the expense of seeing a decline in retention or NPS scores. And quite frankly, those NPS scores have stayed healthy despite the price increase. So as much as price increases can land well, they have landed well, and we're very happy with how that transpired throughout '23. For '24, we do expect to have price increases again. We do not think that we're going to be in the 150 basis point range. We're certainly going to be above our historical average of about 50 basis points. But once again, we'll watch closely and make sure that the underlying value proposition for our clients stays in place, and we'll take some price for sure, but not to the extent that we did in FY '23. Bryan Bergin : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tien- Tsin Huang : Hi, thanks so much. Yes. With the great bookings here, I'm just thinking around the conversion. You mentioned implementation cycles. I'm just curious if you've seen any change from clients and their desire to implement. And then similarly, just maybe based on your comments there on next-gen HCM, I'd love to hear a little bit more around the appetite from your prospects to upgrade now at this point in the cycle. What's the pitch here given some of the macro uncertainty? Maria Black : So, I think both of your questions, I just want to confirm, I'm hearing them the right way. I think they both kind of speak to the general sentiment around the demand environment. Tien- Tsin Huang : Yes. Maria Black : Is that kind of a good way to think about it in terms of decisions getting delayed and/or what's the appetite to, I suppose, by HCM in the current macro environment. And so, I'll comment on the general demand environment and feel free to follow-up with an additional question if I didn't cover what you wanted. But the way that I think about demand, and I've spoken to it quite a bit over the last couple of quarters. Demand remains strong, and that is very broad-based across the business. And so, if you think about the down market, you still have the strength of small business formations. You have the strength of hiring that's happening in the down market. And as such you have clients there needing to make decisions around our HCM offers in that space, right? So that's definitely a place that we've been winning, and we'll continue to lean in as warranted by the demand. The mid-market, as we talked about that a little bit earlier in terms of the overall demand there for the complexity that exists in that market. That's inclusive again of the solution we have around our HR outsourcing offerings. And so that's kind of the mid-market. So getting to your question, which is really about the enterprise space and perhaps even the MNC space, it is an area that we continue to watch as it relates to demand cycles, decision delays. And the main reason is those are really the places that you, as you're aware, have additional, perhaps signers, additional levels of approval, things of that nature. And what I would say, which is consistent with what we've been seeing, is that we are back to pre-pandemic levels. So deal cycles did shorten during the pandemic, and they elongated back the pre-pandemic. But it isn't something that we're seeing additional elongation beyond historical averages. And so to your point, though, it is an area that we consistently watch both in the enterprise space as well as in our international business, just to kind of see if the demand cycle is at the client's appetite to make buying decisions or implementation decisions during this time has changed thus far, we're not seeing it in a broad-based way. But it is an area we continue to monitor. Tien- Tsin Huang : Okay. No, that's great. You answered it better than I asked the question. So thanks for that. Just on the - as a quick follow-up, just I heard a lot about the sales and the go-to-market investments that makes sense. Just how about R&D growth here in the upcoming year versus fiscal '23? How might growth be different? And also, how might the composition be different in terms of where you're placing your bets on R&D? Thanks, that's all I have. Don McGuire : Yes. I think we have a number of projects that we've shared with you all over the past number of quarters. Those projects are well underway. We won't take a lot of time talking about specific Gen AI product projects, but I guess that would be a place that would anticipate I'll get a question we'll get a question for that later on in this call, given it's so topical. But generally, we're continuing our direction with the investments that we've described over the past number of quarters, and we continue to make good progress. We continue to have good delivery. The ability to take RUN to markets in Europe is an example of that, how investments in that development in that technology has increased. And by the way, that's part of our broader strategy that we've touched on many times, is to take some of these developments and make sure that they're global in nature as opposed to only local in nature. So nothing incredibly new, just a continuation of the great work and the great projects we have underway. Tien- Tsin Huang : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open. Mark Marcon : Hi, good morning. And let me add my congratulations, particularly on the strong new bookings. Maria, you went through your three key strategic initiatives and all the subsections - of the various initiatives which ones are going to be the most impactful do you think from a near-term perspective? And then one specific question. Within the mid-market, you mentioned not only deploying next-gen payroll, but you also talked about the time engine. And I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on that? Maria Black : Sure. And thank you, Mark. I appreciate the congratulations. So, I am very excited about the strategic priorities, as I outlined during the prepared remarks. I don't know that I was necessarily expecting to have to pick a favorite pillar or a - one that I expect to yield impact faster than another because I think broadly speaking, they apply across all of ADP, and they will depend a bit as it relates to kind of each business, right? And so, when I think about some of the product investments that we're making. Some of the things, the work that we've done and the impact, whether it's taking a product like roll internationally, which I mentioned earlier, will be short-term results, but some of the impact of continuing to build on the momentum we have in the mid-market with our next-generation payroll engine, as an example, where we have an ability to win differently, we see competitive advantages and differentiation there. I think that's an area that can have tremendous impact in short order. I think the other is Don did it first, which is he mentioned the likes of generative AI. And when I think about that, the Gen AI and applying it broadly across these pillars, I think there is opportunity for us in product that's pretty tremendous, whether it's solving real opportunities for our clients to become more efficient. We've talked a lot about that, whether that's things like job descriptions, performance reviews, things of that nature. But it also leads me kind of to that second pillar to your point around what will come short-term versus long-term. I think there's opportunity in the short-term that will make impact as well as the long-term, in terms of really applying generative AI across our expertise that we provide to our clients. And so, when I think about our ability to make it easier for our clients to engage with us or our associates to engage with our clients, some of the tools that - we have already deployed across various businesses and will further deploy into fiscal '24, such as - think of it almost as a copilot agent assist where we're helping our agents be more efficient. That's going to yield short-term results, if nothing else in client satisfaction. And again, we know happy clients lead to a longer staying clients that leads to more sales and the wheel, if you will. So, I think there are opportunities across all of the strategic priorities to have some impact us sooner than the long-term. But yes, I'm equally excited about all of them. And certainly, we spoke quite a bit about the global piece. In terms of the next-generation time engine, that is being developed in tandem with our next-generation payroll engine. And those two things are really about time and payroll sitting together in our mid-market. It is a based on the same backbone of technology. And so, we're very excited to take that more broadly across the mid-market as we continue to take the next generation payroll engine also more broadly crossed. And I think, both of those things will get feathered into the impact of our win rates, if you will, and our new business bookings in the mid-market throughout the course of '24. Mark Marcon : That's great. And then, Don, you mentioned the margin expectations for the full year. And you mentioned that in the first quarter, it's probably going to be a little bit lower and then feather up over the course of the year. How much lower during the first quarter? And what's the driver there? And then how should we think about the pacing of the improvement quarter-to-quarter? Don McGuire : Yes, Mark, thanks for the question. We're not looking at a big change in the first quarter, but just a couple of the drivers. Just to be clear. One, we do have some incremental investment in cost and headcount, et cetera. But the other big driver in the first quarter is it's a big borrowing quarter for us in our laddered client fund interest strategy. So that's going to put a little bit of pressure on the margin for the fourth - sorry, for the first quarter. And the margin will continue to build over the course of the year, and we will get the overall improvement that we expected, but more out of the three quarters as opposed to the first. Mark Marcon : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Eugene Simuni with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Eugene Simuni : Thank you. Good morning, guys. I want to come back to the PEO for a second. So great to hear about strong PEO bookings in the fourth quarter and going into the New Year. Can you provide a bit more color on what helped generate this reacceleration in bookings? I know you talked in the past, Maria, about some of the actions you guys have taken to generate PEO sales, I would love to hear what caused the acceleration in bookings? And are those initiatives that as kind of levers you're pulling now completely pulled or is it still work in progress and will continue into FY '24? Maria Black : Sure. Good morning, Eugene. PEO bookings, again, we're incredibly pleased with the results in the fourth quarter and the reacceleration. We also did see the reacceleration in the third quarter. So the back half of the PEO was exactly as you suggested. It was a lot of focus for the management team, and I'm really excited about how we came together to execute. And in terms of the overall demand trends in long-term, short term. I remain bullish on the overall value proposition of the PEO and the demand that it warrants. It's hard in that business to kind of pin down the demand trends, because there are so many variables. And in the PEO, it's not as simple as looking at just leads and number of request for proposals that are coming in, because as you know, not every client as a potential fits. So it's a little a little difficult to pin down kind of the various demand trends in the specificity outside of the overall belief in the demand environment. And there's a normal level of kind of variability as it relates to PEO bookings quarter-to-quarter, which also makes it hard to kind of spot various trends. Some of that has to do with the calendar year-end. Some of that has to do with when renewals happen. But nonetheless, there was a tremendous amount of focus and still remains. We remain very focused as a team across all of the leadership to make sure that we continue to drive the strong growth in bookings in the PEO in '24. Eugene Simuni : Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, probably for Don. We talked about margin costs a little bit. So you expect another year of robust margin improvement next year. But obviously, you're not going to have as much tailwind in revenue growth as you had this year. And if you kind of do some of the [bet and Roll] math, it looks like your adjusted OpEx will need to grow slower next year than it did this year for you to hit your goal. So just hoping maybe you can talk a little bit, what are, the areas of spend where you will temper next year or maybe pullback, especially if macro conditions are not as good as kind of we expect them to be? Don McGuire : Yes. So thanks for the question. Let me start by what won't change. So what won't change is that we'll continue to make sure that we invest in key areas of the business to make sure that we can run it effectively. And with the strong bookings, we'll make sure that we have the people on the ground for implementation to get those deals up and running and generating revenue for us, et cetera. But in the last year, we did have pretty substantial growth in, over the last couple of years coming out of the pandemic. I can't believe we're still talking about the pandemic. But as we came out of the pandemic, we did have substantial growth in expenses in service, implementation, sales, et cetera. And while we do continue to expect to see some growth, we're not going to see as much growth in expenses in those areas. So that would be one of the areas that is going to make sure and you hit on it with respect to OpEx. We're not going to see the growth in OpEx expense that we saw in the prior year. The other contributor, of course, that will continue to contribute. I think, the yield curve is more favorable than it was the last time I spoke to you all. We will get contribution from client fund interest next year. But at the same time, it's not going to be to the extent that we did in '23. So that's also going to help with driving margins higher. But once again, not the same tailwind - tailwinds that we had in '23. I think those are the main items that are going to help us improve our margins going into next year. Eugene Simuni : Got it. Very helpful. Yes perhaps. Operator : Thank you. Our question comes from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Scott Wurtzel : Hi, good morning guys. And thanks for taking my questions. Maybe, Don, first on the cadence of revenue growth. I know you said it should be relatively stable throughout the year, but wondering if you can maybe sort of parse that out between ES and PEO if there's any differences we should think about there? Don McGuire : Yes. So, I think revenue growth is going to be - revenue growth is going to be pretty consistent throughout the year as we start the - as we start that big backlog that we now have as a result of that very, very strong fourth quarter bookings result. So, we will see consistency there. Likewise with PEO, it's going to be a bit of a slower burn as we did have strong sales in Q4. So, we did also talk about slightly lower pace control growth in the PEO business. So - but I don't think they're really going to be that different. I think, they're going to be pretty close if you think about the overall growth, and consolidate the results for the company not substantially different between the business units. Danyal Hussain : Yes, Scott, there is a slightly different cadence for the two, it's not a huge difference. For PEO, we do expect an acceleration over the course of the year. So, the contribution we get from our bookings and from the improvements in retention, we're expecting gradually overcoming slowing pays per control that should lead to an accelerating PEO revenue growth. And on ES, we're expecting some deceleration assuming pay per control decelerate and assuming the contribution from client funds interest starts to fade gradually over the course of the year. So you end up with two different-looking ramps, but they offset and that what nets us to a very stable revenue growth overall. Scott Wurtzel : Got it. It's very helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up on the Gen AI topic, going back to it. Obviously, there's a lot to sort of be excited about there. But just kind of wondering the magnitude of investment needed there, is that investment essentially all incremental to your investment plans for the year? Or have you had to maybe put some other projects on the back burner to focus a little more on Gen AI? Maria Black : Yes. And so said differently, the good news is we just went through our strategic plan process in the last six months. And so, we had all of our priority sequence in all of our investments and incremental investments lined up. As we marry that to Gen AI, we have a very clear lens on where some projects may get enhanced and where some projects may look different and perhaps get replaced by a new way of thinking about it. And so candidly speaking, we're going through a lot of these opportunities at this juncture kind of thinking through the bets and there will be incremental investment. And there will be other investments that we repurposed to go do some of these things - in a new way. So, the answer is both. Scott Wurtzel : Got it. Thanks guys. And congrats on the results. Maria Black : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Christiansen with Citi. Your line is open. Peter Christiansen : Thank you. Good morning. I'll also add to the congratulations ratio. Nice trends. Maria, a question on the international scaling effort here. I was just wondering if you could - in this context, if you could put some parameters on expected investment spend, I guess, over the next one to two years? And do you see M&A as an important contributor to the growth algorithm there? Maria Black : Sure. You started with a question on international. So is the rest of your question about international or is it just in general? Peter Christiansen : Correct. Maria Black : About international. Yes. So, we have been, over the years, been making in-country decisions on investments. I talked a lot about the, call it, the feet on the street, the final mile of infrastructure that we have to support our international business. And so, we will continue to do that. That's inclusive of each year. We go into new markets and some of those are organic ways that we go into new markets. Some of those are actually partners that we ultimately end up at some point, call it, purchasing, if you will, or acquiring. And so, the answer is both organic and inorganic. That's kind of how we've built the business over the last 20 years. And we will continue where warranted to think about it both ways. And the decision criteria for us is really about speed. A lot of times, it's our clients that pulled us into incremental markets. When I think about the five markets that we went into this year or the two countries that we're heading into with global view, they're byproduct of clients that are choosing to pay employees in certain markets. And as such, for us, a lot of times the decision we make on how to get there, has a lot to do with speed. And as such, again, we will leverage both organic and inorganic ways to get there. So, I don't know, Don, you ran our international business for a very long time. I don't know if you want to add anything. Don McGuire : Yes, maybe just to add, I think what we've been doing, Peter, over the last number of years is we have done a number of acquisitions. They've been mostly tuck-ins, but we did have three interesting ones over the last year. We acquired an Italian company that has a good budget payroll - budgeting software tool that's very prominent in the Italian market. We acquired our - so it streamlines [indiscernible] partner in South Africa. And we also want a very exciting mid-market time-and-attendance product called SecureX in out of Bangalore in India. So - and that product is available in India, most of Southeast Asia and the Middle East. So, I think that's a demonstration of what we've been doing, we've been looking at and focused on to continue to make sure we grow that footprint, and we do think it continues to be an exciting space for us. Peter Christiansen : Thanks. That's great. And Don, just as a follow-up, last slide on the maturation schedule of client fund investments, super helpful. But as we think about intra-year investment turnover - should that correlate with the seasonal balance levels that we typically see? Don McGuire : Yes. So I think as those - investments mature, you're going to see those investments reinvested at higher rates, and we do expect to see our average return go up over the course of the year. The current reinvestment schedules, overnights are reinvesting at 5%. The extended in the loan portfolios are being reinvested at about 4%.We don't expect to see a huge change in the mix. Although the average duration of our investments has shortened a little bit over the last couple of years. But you can pretty much look at those yields, look at the maturity schedule that we provided and then look at the composition of our portfolio across the overnight, the extended and the long and pretty much come to a conclusion or come to some numbers on where you think we're going to end up. Peter Christiansen : Thanks. And just one quick one. How should we think about the duration strategy, I guess, for the next couple of quarters here now that the Fed is perhaps kind of like stabilized, but are - is there an effort to extend duration shorten it? Just any sense there would be helpful? And thank you. Don McGuire : Yes. We've had this question a few times, and - the answer is we've been very successful with the strategy that we've had for the last 20 years. We certainly see that there is an opportunity cost not ever having everything in short today. At the same time, we do believe that the yield curve will normalize and the strategy we've had in place will come back and be beneficial to us over the longer term. So you shouldn't expect any significant change in our investment strategy. Peter Christiansen : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. James Faucette : Thank you very much. I wanted to go back quickly on retention. I know you've touched on it a little bit. Last year, your initial outlook called for around 50 - minus 50 to minus 25 basis points of retention degradation. But that obviously didn't really play out. And this year, you're starting with a more conservative kind of minus 70 to minus 50. But I'm hoping you could speak to how much conservatism is embedded there? And what are the drivers that you're seeing as a reason to be a little bit more conservative to start than maybe you were last year even? Maria Black : Yes, fair. It's a fair observation, James. Appreciate it. I think the we thought about - by the way, I wish I knew the answer, right? So the question you're asking which is how much conservatism is in there? And that's all to say and you hit the nail on the head, we set into this year guiding minus 25 to 50, we're stepping into fiscal '24 with a guide of minus 50 to 70 - and we hope - I'll end - or I'll start with, we're very happy with where things are. We're firing on all cylinders. We have many businesses that have record MPS results, record retention results and everything is good. And so as we step into the year, the way that we are modeling what you would see in pays per control. The way we're thinking about the potential macroeconomic tempering, if you will, specifically in the back half, is really a byproduct of how we see retention. Part of what we saw in the fourth quarter that led to the incredible results that we had was that the normalization that we've been seeing in the down-market, we did actually see the down market bounce a little bit. So even while it was down year-on-year, it came in stronger than we expected. And so we do anticipate that we may need to give some of that back, which is why we believe it was prudent to align our retention targets through our medium-term targets that we gave back in the Investor Day of 2021. So I wish I knew the answer to your question in terms of how much conservatism, why we are guiding to what we're guiding is really about the economic outlook, whether that's GDP, unemployment is still at record lows. We haven't seen unemployment rates that low since the 60s. And so our guess is as good as yours at some level, but we did build in some tempering of the economy in the back half, and that's really what's yielding that guide on the retention. James Faucette : Great. I appreciate that color, Maria. That's really helpful and makes a lot of sense. I want to turn quickly also to M&A. You mentioned it in the prepared remarks, also, I mentioned it as part of at least some of your strategic initiatives. What are you seeing in terms of overall valuation levels? And what kind of things would you be targeting in terms of geography or product capabilities? Thanks a lot. Don McGuire : Yes, James. So in terms of what we're targeting, what we're talking about, there's always things kicking around, of course, but we want to make sure that anything that we do acquire either fits well in the core and gives us additional capability, or it's something that really exceeds some functionality capability that we currently have, so that we're not stacking on more and more product on top of what we already have. The other area, of course, is to make sure that - we do things that are natural adjacencies - are very strong adjacencies to what we already do so that they fit well. And then thirdly, of course, is making sure that we can sell these things and run these things in a recurring model, so that we can sell them the way we sell everything else we sell today and operate them and expect to get revenue anticipation and good model from what we buy. So I think those are the things we think about. I think we're hearing a lot around valuations coming down in the press, certainly a little bit of a dearth of activity, if you will, in the M&A space these days. But we do have lots of conversations about acquisitions and whatnot. I still think, of course, everybody is looking to get a premium what they have. And we're trying to make sure that if we're going to buy something, we're paying the right price. But we don't actually get to the point of many of these conversations given the conditions that I stated at the front at the outset to actually have a view on overall valuations in the market. We likely get to talking about valuation in a very, very few number of cases. Remembering, of course, very, very few of the opportunities we get even get to that conversation. So I don't think I can say we have a general view. But we are focused on what we would have to pay and how things would fit into ADP. James Faucette : That's great. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Kartik Mehta : Maria and Don, you've obviously talked a lot about the PEO and seems that the demand has really picked up. But I'm wondering, are you seeing any of your customers maybe taking a little bit of a breather now pointing to sign up for the PEO because of the uncertainty in the economy and that being maybe more expensive product? Maria Black : The PEO has a tremendous value proposition. I think we always refer to ADP as an all-weather company. I would say the most durable of our all-weather businesses is the PEO. And a lot of that has to do with the ability to flex that value proposition in a downturn pretty quickly. So if you think about clients that are growing, they enjoy the PEO because it's a quick go-to-market. On the downside, if you will, as clients are potentially trying to work through economic headwinds, the PEO serves as a place that has a clear return on investment, has a total cost of ownership that's very again, very clear. And so I think it's a business that not to suggest that it's not impacted by a downturn, but it's a business that kind of works in both. What I would say is our sales force, we're able to pivot that narrative and that value proposition as warranted. I don't believe that has happened. So to answer the question, our clients at this point, hesitant to purchase something such as the PEO that's so comprehensive because of the macroeconomic challenges. And my view would be, no. I think that's substantiated by the record results that we had in the PEO bookings in the quarter. We also saw that strength in bookings in the third quarter. So I think that value proposition is holding firm. And I think it's a business that should - should the economic wins ever come to life that we've been expecting for so long. It's a business that can pivot pretty quickly and the demand for the offer remains. Kartik Mehta : And then just a follow-up. Don, you talked about obviously pays per control and retention and maybe retention moderating as the year goes through. For pay per control, would you anticipate that just to get to flat by the end of the year? Or are you anticipating that, that could potentially go negative, and that's how you've built the guidance? Don McGuire : No. We're certainly not anticipating this as you go negative. We do, though, think it's going to go to somewhere ever 1% to 2%, which is a little bit less than our historical average. However, I just want to make sure that everybody understands, we're exiting the year pretty healthily. So we figure we're off to a pretty good start, but we do expect that we're going to see a bit of a decline over the next three, four quarters. And once again, we're aligning ourselves to the best we can with unemployment forecasts and et cetera. Danny Hussain : Karthik, if you're asking specifically about where we're exiting fiscal '24, then the pay per control is effectively decelerating from this kind of 3% range to something flatter. Kartik Mehta : Okay. Perfect. Thanks Danny. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Maria Black for closing remarks. Maria Black : Thank you, and thank you, everyone, for joining today. As you've heard, Don and I, the entire leadership team we're incredibly pleased with fiscal '23, specifically the fourth quarter and the finish. So I'll kind of end where I started, which is, I want to take the opportunity to once again thank the associates that create this performance. It's an unbelievable magical thing to watch it all come together and deliver what we just delivered. And so my gratitude and I celebrate each and every one of them. I also want to thank all of the stakeholders, including all of you who listen today, appreciate the support. We're certainly excited for fiscal '24. So cheers to that. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This concludes the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Michelle, and I'll be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. After the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Danny Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Danyal Hussain : Thank you, Michelle, and welcome everyone to ADP's first quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. Participating today are Maria Black, our President and CEO; and Don McGuire, our CFO. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call. During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these items along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release. Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. I'll now turn it over to Maria. Maria Black : Thank you, Danny, and thank you, everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported strong first quarter results, including 7% revenue growth and 12% adjusted EPS growth, and we made significant progress on the three strategic priorities we shared with you last quarter. Let me begin by quickly reviewing some of our financial highlights from the first quarter. We had a solid start to the year in Employer Services new business bookings with record-level volume for first quarter which was supported by a particularly strong September. Among our best performers were our small business portfolio and our compliance-oriented solutions. Overall demand in HCM has remained steady and we maintained a healthy new business pipeline at the end of the quarter across our business. Our Employer Services retention rate once again exceeded our expectations. Although, retention declined slightly versus the prior year, including in our small business portfolio, we continued to see resilience among our clients. More importantly, our overall NPS scores reached a new all-time high, positioning us to stay near these historically high retention levels. Our Employer Services pays per control growth was 2% for the first quarter as our clients continued to add employees at a pace that is gradually slowing. And our PEO revenue growth of 3% in the quarter was relatively stable versus last quarter, reflecting solid PEO bookings performance offset by deceleration in PEO pays per control growth. Don will speak to our updated guidance in a moment, but the demand environment for PEO as well as our other outsourcing services remains healthy. Moving on, we made meaningful progress across all three of our strategic priorities that we outlined last quarter. Let me start with an update on some actions we took in Q1 to lead with best-in-class HCM technology. First, we began embedding Gen AI features into our products. In Q1, we integrated Gen AI into Roll to further enhance its conversational UI and make it even easier for small business owners to quickly obtain customized Payroll and HR guidance. We also began rolling out ADP Assist, which delivers insights and recommendations to make complex HR work simple. We've enabled ADP Assist for select Workforce Now clients, beginning with a Report Assist feature that allows practitioners to easily extract the insights they're looking for. We look forward to continuing to build on the live feature set of ADP Assist to further enhance the experiences of both HR practitioners and employees. We also had some exciting product developments beyond AI. Our clients tell us they need personalized experiences and deep integrations to help them manage the complexity of running a business today. To help address this, we recently launched a new product called API Central, which enables businesses to easily and securely connect their ADP workforce data across systems using pre-populated APIs and tools. This is a feature our clients have increasingly asked for and we have already seen a strong uptake. In Q1, we complemented the launch of API Central with the acquisition of Sora, an intelligent workflow automation and data integration tool. Sora's unique capabilities will allow our clients to automate people processes by unifying various applications such as HR, IT, CRM, and more, creating a smarter and easier-to-use experience for our clients. In Q1, we also launched ADP Workforce Now for construction, a comprehensive offering designed to help clients with the unique payroll and HCM needs of the construction industry. This verticalized offering combines tailored Workforce Now capabilities and reporting with a team of dedicated specialists for the construction industry. While ADP has always served clients across the full spectrum of industries, construction stood out to us as a vertical with enough complexity to warrant a more tailored solution, and we're excited to further strengthen our offering in the mid-market. We also announced the launch of our corporate venture capital fund earlier this month, leading with best-in-class HCM technology requires that we stay attuned to the frontier of HCM innovation. And now, in addition to the organic efforts we are developing in ADP Ventures, we will invest in and partner with early-stage startups to strengthen our core business our core business and to extend into natural adjacencies. Two of our early investments focus on improving lifestyle benefits to drive associate engagement in simplifying the incredibly complex leave management process that businesses and their workers have to address. We're excited to build on these partnerships and develop new ones. Overall, Q1 was a very busy quarter on the product front with much of the work we're doing representing seeds of innovation that will position us to continue shaping the future of work. Our second strategic priority is to provide unmatched expertise and outsourcing solutions. In addition to launching the pilot of ADP Assist for our clients, we also launched the pilot of our new Agent Assist embedding Gen AI in the flow of work for ADP Associates. So far, we have enabled our call summarization capability to select associates. Thanks to this Agent Assist feature, those service associates no longer need to spend time writing up case notes after client calls, which should make our associates more effective and also allow us to quickly aggregate real-time client feedback to continuously improve our products. We are also piloting Agent Assist real-time guidance for our associates to help them with support content and guided workflows and to more easily share their accumulated knowledge in a way that's customized to individual client cases. We are excited to continue working toward additional Agent Assist features to help our implementation and service associates deliver better, faster service and to help our client satisfaction scores continue to reach new record levels. Our third strategic priority is to benefit our clients through our global scale, and in Q1, we expanded on this advantage. In August, we extended our leading global footprint by acquiring the payroll business of BTR, our longtime partner in Sweden. Acquisitions like this strengthen our multi-country payroll ecosystem while also positioning us to grow a local HCM business in countries with attractive growth prospects. In Q1, we launched Roll in Ireland, representing the beginning of an expansion into the European market, where we believe an AI-based payroll app coupled with our existing on the ground ecosystem will allow us to expand our SMB business outside the U.S. And during Q1, we also announced plans to deepen our existing partnership with Workday to deliver enhanced global payroll compliance and HR for the many clients we jointly serve around the world. Partnerships like this reflect our long-standing commitment to provide the personalization and overall experience our clients desire. Before turning it over to Don, I wanted to highlight a couple milestones in two of our businesses. Our suite of workforce management solutions, sometimes referred to as time and labor management, reached more than 125,000 clients in the first quarter, benefiting from a double-digit growth rate these last few years. Scheduling and precisely tracking time has become more important for employers over recent years in order to meet evolving legislative requirements, and we look forward to continuing to invest in our workforce management solutions to drive higher client attach rates. We also now serve more than 150,000 retirement services clients, which is up more than 20% from the 125,000 clients we served at the end of fiscal 2022. We anticipate growth for our retirement services business will remain strong in the years ahead as the provisions of the SECURE Act 2.0 and additional state mandates continue to phase in and as companies of all sizes continue to recognize the importance of positioning their workers well for their eventual retirement. I'm proud of our start to fiscal 2024 with both strong financial results and meaningful strategic progress. Our roadmap for the months ahead is keeping us incredibly busy. And with this in mind, I'd like to take a moment to recognize our associates across sales, service, implementation and technology whose efforts and outstanding performance are positioning us to consistently deliver for our clients and our shareholders. Thank you, all. With that, I'll turn it over to Don. Don McGuire : Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some more color on our results for the quarter and update you on our fiscal '24 outlook. Overall, we had a solid Q1 and are not making changes to our consolidated outlook, but there are some moving pieces I'll cover. Let me start with Employer Services. ES segment revenue increased 9% on a reported basis and 8% on an organic constant currency basis, ahead of our expectations. As Maria shared, ES new business bookings had a solid start with especially strong growth in September. The demand environment is stable, our pipelines are healthy, and we are on track for our 4% to 7% growth guidance. Our ES retention did decline slightly in Q1 versus the prior year, but that was slightly better than we expected. At this point, we are maintaining our outlook for a 50 basis point to 70 basis point decline in full year retention, which continues to embed an expectation for small business losses to increase due to higher out of business rates. But if recent trends continue, then we would hope to outperform that range. ES pays per control growth was in line with our expectation in Q1. It decelerated modestly to 2%, and we expect this very gradual deceleration to continue in the coming quarters and are maintaining our outlook for 1% to 2% growth for the full year. Client funds interest revenue increased in line with our expectation in Q1, but we're raising our full year outlook based on the latest forward yield curve, which result in a modest increase in average yield to 2.9% from our prior expectation of 2.8%. We now expect client funds interest revenue as well as the net impact from our client funds extended strategy to be up $35 million from our prior outlook. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar strengthened, representing a drag relative to our prior fiscal '24 revenue outlook. In total, our strong Q1 ES revenue growth combined with higher than expected client's funds revenue for the rest of the year effectively offset the adverse FX movement and we're maintaining our fiscal '24 ES revenue growth range of 7% to 8%. Our ES margin increased 220 basis points in Q1, driven by both operating leverage and contribution from client's funds interest revenue. For the full year, we are raising our fiscal '24 outlook to now anticipate an increase of 150 basis points to 170 basis points, which reflects the benefit of higher yields, partially offset by higher spend on Gen AI projects and usage, as well as a small amount of dilution from our recent acquisitions. Moving on to the PEO. We had 3% revenue growth driven by 2% growth in average worksite employees in Q1. As Maria mentioned earlier, our PEO bookings growth was solid, but pays for control growth continued to slow and was lower than expected, particularly for clients in the professional services and tech industries. This resulted in a slightly softer Q1 worksite employee count than we were anticipating. As a result, we now expect fiscal 2024 PEO revenue growth of 3% to 4% with growth in average worksite employees of 2% to 3%. Our PEO sales pipelines are healthy and we continue to forecast their worksite employee growth gradually ramping in the back half of fiscal '24. PEO margin decreased 90 basis points in Q1 which is more than we had planned. The decline was primarily driven by a lower workers' compensation reserve release benefit as well as higher selling expenses. We now expect PEO margin to be down between 50 basis points and 100 basis points in fiscal '24 with the continued assumption for higher selling expenses as well as year-over-year headwind from a lower workers' compensation reserve release benefit than we experienced in fiscal '23. Putting it all together, there is no change to our consolidated outlook, but I would like to share some color on cadence. In Q2, our client funds balanced growth will lightly impact the payroll tax deferral that we had in our average balance for the past two years, which creates some grow over pressure on our client's funds balance and will result in more modest ES margin expansion in Q2 than other quarters this year as well as a modest revenue impact. As a result, we expect consolidated revenue growth to moderate before accelerating slightly in the back half. And we expect adjusted EBIT margin to be down slightly before ramping in the back half of the year. This was already contemplated in our guidance at the outset of the year. So again, no change to our consolidated guidance. We continue to forecast fiscal '24 consolidated revenue growth of 6% to 7% with our adjusted EBIT margin expanding by 60 basis points to 80 basis points. We still expect our effective tax rate for fiscal '24 to be around 23% and we anticipate adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 12%. Thank you. And I'll now turn it back to Michelle for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Samad Samana : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe first just want to double-click on the PEO side. I think that, the information you gave helps to understand some of what happened in the revised guidance, but maybe just help us understand what's giving that back half ramp confidence, especially, as you expect pays per control in the kind of broader macro to continue to decelerate. Where should we get the acceleration in the PEO WSEs? Is it purely based on bookings ramping? Is it based on an expectation that the base will stabilize? Maybe just dig into that a little bit further because they're moving in different directions. Maria Black : You bet. So, good morning, Samad. It's Maria here. I thought I'd kind of break down your question with respect to the PEO, call it, double-click. So I'll start by commenting on the first quarter. So, I've mentioned, we did see deceleration in PEO pays per control. So as Don mentioned in the opening comments, that is a byproduct of what we're seeing in the pressure with respect to, as you know, that business tends to skew more into professional services technology. The pays per control deceleration is happening at a faster clip in those cohorts than the broader base. And so said differently, the pays per control growth in the PEO is decelerating faster than we expected and faster specifically in those cohorts. So in terms of the contributions, that is the contribution to the deceleration or the new guide to worksite employee growth that we're seeing in the first quarter. We did have strong bookings in PEO in the first quarter. That said, it did come in slightly below where we had hoped for, so it was still higher than overall employer services. It was a good quarter for the PEO and this is now the third quarter in a row that we've seen strength in bookings in the PEO. And that's important to note because really the strength in PEO bookings is what ultimately will yield the reacceleration that you're asking about in the back half. That coupled with kind of what we're seeing in retention. So while retention is stable and stabilizing inside the PEO, it isn't back to the high growth levels that we saw, call it, a couple of years ago in the last year or so, and as such as those compares continue to lap coupled with retention continuing to accelerate, if you will versus stabilize. We will see contributions from retention, we'll see more contributions from bookings and that's really why we anticipate the worksite employee guide for the year that we've given. Samad Samana : Great. And Maria, I actually had a follow-up for you as well on the international side. Maria Black : Yeah. Samad Samana : After seeing the rollout of the product into Ireland. And I'm just curious, how should we think about the expansion beyond the U.S.? I know ADP already has a presence and it's a meaningful contributor to revenue, but just should we think about international maybe being an offset to some of the slowdown that we're seeing in U.S. revenue? Just how should we think about the cadence and impact as you move more international with your core HCM solutions versus just helping U.S. employers that already had an international presence? Maria Black : Yeah. Absolutely. So I'll speak to Roll, which is what I commented on in the opening comments. So we did roll out, no pun (ph) unintended, our roll offering into Ireland. And it is an exciting bit for us, albeit it's very early days, right? It's actually only been a couple of weeks. But we're excited about it because it's the first of many countries where we intend on taking the, call it, very down market offering into our various countries throughout international. And it's really about marrying that product with what we see as still potentially greenfield opportunity within our international space and really leveraging the ecosystem that we have, that's everything from distribution to all the services call it around, the offers in various countries. So we're very excited about that. Now, in terms of the overall growth contributions in the short term of rolling out Roll into Ireland, I would say they're negligible. I would say even Roll over time this year, I think it would be, not a meaningful contributor to bookings. To me, I think this is really about a long-term investment that we're making across international and what we see as a continued opportunity for us. So you kind of mentioned is this companies that have a presence in Europe, that exist in the U.S. with folks working in or call it in international? And the answer is, this is both of that coupled also with a lot of our, what I would say, best-of-breed offerings in international. So we see growth opportunity really across the board in international and that's everything from the down market, which we're going after now with this new product offering of Roll. So we see it in the SMB space, we see it in our best-of-breed space and we also see it in our global MNC space. So really excited about the long-term growth opportunity that continues to be international. And while on international, I thought I would just mention because it's important to note, we did have a very strong quarter with respect to international, albeit that quarter is obviously off of a compare Q1 of last year that was less favorable, but it is on the heels of what was a very strong fourth quarter finish in international. And so, all the way around, I continue to be incredibly excited and optimistic about what it is that we can go accomplish and continue to build in our international offering. Samad Samana : Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Bryan Bergin : Hi. Good morning. Thank you. So, Maria, I was hoping if you can comment on just how you're seeing the overall macro situation evolve and maybe how that may affect demand? And if you can specifically unpack that within the ES segment, maybe talk about some of the areas that came in better than you expected versus any areas that may have been lighter or downtick versus the prior quarter. Maria Black : Absolutely. Good morning, Bryan. So happy to comment on what we saw in the first quarter with respect to the overall performance of bookings, but also the demand. So I'll kind of start with the overall performance. I mentioned in the opening comments, we did see strength, continued strength in our down market, so really excited about that. Also saw tremendous strength in our compliance solutions offering. So think of it as all the stuff that hits compliance tax, things of that nature. So we're pleased with what we saw with respect to new business bookings. Those are the two that really outperformed. And it's exciting to see because really that entire down market offering and that's everything from our run offering to retirement services, insurance services, we continue to see tremendous strength there. We saw that all of last year and definitely the finish last year, and it makes me happy because it's a lot of the places that, well, good performance makes me happy regardless, but it's a lot of the places where we've been making meaningful investments both in the product as well as the distribution. So excited to see the continued performance there and the outperformance. The overall results do keep us in line with our full year guide. So excited to confirm that again here today. In terms of the overall demand environment and I feel like I've been saying this quarter-to-quarter, but we're not really seeing any major changes in demand. Demand is still strong, demand is still healthy. We see that in our bookings results. There are all sorts of other indicators that we look at in terms of pipelines, in the up-market, in the mid-market, certainly in the down-market. We're looking at things such as new appointments and kind of activity, excuse me, activity measures to really give us a guide on whether demand is strong. And I would tell you pipelines are healthy year-on-year and certainly activity is healthy. And so we don't see a big demand change again this quarter. In fact, it\u2019s kind of the opposite stepping into the quarter on the heels of a strong September. We feel really good about where our pipeline sit year-on-year, which again is giving us the confidence in the full year guide. As always though, Bryan, we continue to keep an eye on the macro. We continue to keep an eye on our global space and international and making sure that we're understanding both any macroeconomic changes coupled with any demand environment that could shift given everything kind of going on in the world, if you will. So that's the current story on kind of pipelines demand in the quarter. Don McGuire : Yeah, maybe.. Bryan Bergin : Okay. Don McGuire : If I could add a couple of comments on the macro, certainly macro continues to be pretty positive. Unemployment rates continue to be near decade lows here in the United States. Unemployment rates around the world continue to be quite low. The discussion about whether or not we're going to be in a recession, I think the odds are now not for a recession. So soft landing is pretty much what is being anticipated. Interest rates are expected to have peaked here in the US. So I think all things considered, things are pretty positive. I think the one area that we put in our original guidance for the year and that we continue to look at is our guidance had in fact contemplated a slowing and pays per control growth. Maria mentioned that and talked about that in the PEO business, but we are confident. We are still seeing growth, albeit, we are seeing growth at a slower pace than we had previously. But once again, that was fully contemplated in our original guide for the year. Bryan Bergin : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Don. My follow-up on the PEO. So heard you, the bookings are a little bit lighter than you expected to start, but you're also calling out, I think higher selling expenses impacting the PEO margins here year-over-year. So can you -- maybe talk about the puts and takes there driving that dynamic? Maria Black : Specifically on PEO margins? I will let Don\u2026 Don McGuire : No. But I think originally, Bryan, you mentioned bookings were lighter than expected. I think our bookings came in \u2013 our bookings came in pretty good, as Maria has mentioned. Maria Black : Yeah. I think he's referencing the comment I made around PEO bookings was slightly lighter than expected. By the way, still higher than ES, which we expect to be the case throughout the balance of the year. So that's the kind of nuanced [Multiple Speakers] Bryan Bergin : So the question there, you're also citing higher selling expenses impacting the PEO margin. So it seems like there's a bit of a disconnect there. Just trying to understand that. Don McGuire : Yeah. So we had planned the year, we talked about the growth being stronger in the second half in bookings, sorry, in margins than in the first half. And certainly we have seen some investment and some higher selling expenses and we'll see in the first half than we will in the second half, but nothing really surprising. A little bit off, but certainly we're in line with what we expected. Bryan Bergin : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. James Faucette : Great. Thanks. I wanted to ask just a couple of quick follow-up questions. First, I think the comment was made that you're still anticipating a bit worse performance in terms of out of business rates on a go-forward basis, but to-date those have been a little bit better than you had anticipated. Can you help provide some detail as to what you're seeing, why you think we're seeing better, survival rates, and kind of the things you may be looking at as indicators that could get worse on a go-forward basis. Don McGuire : Yeah. Demand continues to be strong in the economy overall, and I think that's supporting what tends to be this view that we're not going to enter into a recession. At best, there's going to be a soft landing. So I think that strong demand environment, particularly consumer demand is keeping small business afloat. So when you also look at what we're seeing in terms of new business formations, there seems to be continued strength in new business formations. So generally I would say that the environment, irrespective of the higher interest rates, the environment continues to be favorable for small business, and I think that's translating itself into what looks to be lower out of business than contemplated now. We have continued, as we said in our original guide, and as we will reiterate or update here today, we have continued to think that we will see a little bit more normalization in other business. So we'd have contemplated that, but we think we are getting closer to where we think we're going to plateau or hit the bottom there. So I think we're very close, and once again, I think it just comes back to demand environment. It tends to be supporting the economy more broadly and more generally and small businesses benefiting from that as well. Maria Black : Yeah. I think if I may, I think the only thing I would add is that it's still very early in the year, right? So when I think about retention, we did have a record level in fiscal '23. We were near that record level a year before, we were at that record level the year before that. And so we've had this tremendous strength. And I think Don is spot on in terms of all the reasons from a macro perspective that we've had that strength in terms of client retention. And so as that normalizes, we believe it's still prudent for us to have the retention guide that we have, which is really a byproduct of how we planned the year in the back half. So I think I got the question last quarter and so I'll answer it proactively this quarter, which is, are we just being conservative? And I think the answer to that question is, it's still early in the year. And so, if we do continue to outperform retention in the way that we outperformed in the first quarter, we hope that we will outperform for the full year. It's just early to take away that conservatism sitting here just, three short months into a very long year. James Faucette : Yeah. And then, I want to go back to kind of a headline related question. You saw that -- you saw or you indicated that you'd seen kind of a 25,000 sequential improvement in retirement services and -- for clients, you alluded to some state mandates there, particularly around SECURE Act 2.0. Can you talk a little bit about what state mandates you've seen or that may be impacting that business or how long before we start to see benefit in their retirement services, post a new state mandate? So maybe we can help track headlines and anticipate like, how big of an impact any new requirements may have? Maria Black : Absolutely. So I think I've spoken quite a bit to retirement services as well as the SECURE Act over the last year or so. And I will tell you, I was excited to report the new milestone today in part because that business continues to show strength, but also because it's a business that I know is adding tremendous value into the world of work. And so, it is an exciting time. It does come as a byproduct of the offering, the investments we've made into the offering, and also these state mandates, some of which are anchored into the SECURE Act at the federal level, some of which are anchored state by state. Candidly, I could probably spend an hour with you and go state by state in terms of all the various mandates. What we see over the next year or so is the threshold of companies that need to comply with the state mandates starts to creep into, call it, the further down market, if not the micro market. And so, as all these states, a lot of them being on the West Coast, if you're looking for headlines tracking states like California, as they continue to pull down at what level do you need to comply with the state mandates and/or the SECURE Act, the more opportunity we will have to ensure that we're helping our clients to solve for this piece, keep them compliant. But again, back to doing good in the world, it's also something that's bringing the value to each one of these employees that are engaging with these clients, so. James Faucette : Great. Appreciate that color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Bryan Keane : Hi, guys. Good morning. Just want to ask about the decline in PEO. Looking at the employee base of PEO declining versus not necessarily the case, looks like almost the opposite in the employer services. So just trying to think about the trends. And does, typically the trend you see in PEO bleed into employer services and why maybe it's been a little bit weaker for pays per control there in PEO versus employer? Maria Black : Yeah. So just to clarify, pays per control in PEO is actually higher. We don't give that number, but it is actually higher than employer services. So I think the first piece suggests is that the bases are actually just different, right? So if you look at the pays per control across the broader ADP, it's really a reflection of a mix of industries. As I mentioned earlier, the PEO tends to skew, by design, by the way, for the offering. It's really -- the offering is the most valuable if you will to the cohorts that we offer it to, which tends to be more professional services, tech-oriented companies that want to offer employers or their employees benefits of choice, if you will, to be employers of choice. And so that skews that base slightly differently than the overall. And what we're seeing within the PEO base is a delineation between those cohorts and the rest of the base, if you will. So we cited it in the prepared remarks, but the deceleration that is happening at the PEO is still a byproduct of within that base having professional services and tech decelerating at a faster clip than the rest of the base. So to answer your question, does it bleed across? I think, we're already hearing these headlines in the market in terms of -- and we see it within our own ADP Research Institute data with respect to professional services and tech hiring being in a different position than the rest of the market. So I think I would suggest it's already been bleeding across. If you look at the last couple of quarters of that, by the way, that also tracks BLS data shows the same thing. You see it in wages. And so all of that to suggest, I would say, the trend we're seeing in the PEO is already in the macro, but the bases are slightly different, which is why you would feel it, the impact of it perhaps more significantly in the PEO PPC than you would in the broader PPC. That was a mouthful, by the way. Bryan Keane : No that was helpful though. Thanks for that clarification. And then the other question I just had is the strength you saw in the ES new bookings especially in September and the way the pipeline looks, but you're not changing the total outlook of 4% to 7%. Just trying to figure out -- do you feel like you guys are maybe trending if things hold trending above the guidance range for bookings given the strength you saw in September in the pipeline and for SMB strength in the quarter? Maria Black : Yeah. What I would offer is that I'm incredibly pleased with the results in the first quarter, especially on the heels of what was an incredible finish last year. And so the pattern that we saw in the first quarter and the strength in September is not a typical of the pattern we see in this -- the first quarter on the heels of an incredibly strong fourth quarter. And so I am excited about the first quarter results, I am excited about the strength in September. But the excitement is actually less about, call it, the finish in September and more about what we see on the year-on-year demand environment, what we see in activity, what we see stepping into this next quarter. And that does give us confidence into our full year guide at that 4% to 7%. What I would also offer though is it's a long year, and when you think about where the skewing, if you will, or the contribution of new business bookings happens for us on a full-year basis, it is in that third and fourth quarter. I'll much call it larger than the first and second quarter. And so we believe it's prudent to given the line of sight that we have today, just a quarter in. But we feel confident in the guide, we're excited about the performance, we're excited about how we're stepping into the quarter. The second quarter that is but we also still have an entire year ahead of us. Bryan Keane : Got it. Thanks for taking the questions. Maria Black : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Please go ahead. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Could you give us your latest thoughts on the competitive environment in PEO and how that's sort of evolving over time? I think there's somewhat slower than historical growth across the industry. Are there any signs that the market is, saturated with providers or is there any competitive overlay to PEO performance? Maria Black : I would suggest that the PEO ASO conversation, if you will, or PEO HR outsourcing offerings kind of continues. I don't know that there's anything new to report, Ramsey. I think from my vantage point, it's always been a very competitive environment. We all have slightly different PEOs from one another. I think we talked a lot about ours today and the way that it skews to professional services and tech. I think you have others that skew to different types of industries. You also have other PEOs that perhaps are a bit more down market. We tend to skew a little bit more upmarket than some. And so I think all the PEOs look slightly different. I think we all know our models are also not identical in terms of how we actually go-to-market, whether it's through the strength that we have in the competitive advantage of being able to have ADP's client base contribute about 50% of those upgrades. So I think how we go to market, our models, never mind the models of, you know, fully insured to self-insured, et cetera. I think similar trends are within the ASO offerings, or some refer to them as HRO offerings. And so I think within there, you also have various models and various go-to-markets in terms of the, some competitors perhaps some -- have some flexibility or more movement between ASO and PEO than I think we've cited in the past. And so, I think all that to suggest I think the competitive environment is about the same and remains. I think I\u2019m optimistic and expect growth in both our PEO bookings as well as our HRO and ASO offerings throughout the balance of this year. And so I think we remain very, very excited and optimistic about the growth of those -- all of our HR outsourcing offerings, both in this year as well as the long term. Ramsey El-Assal: Got it. Okay. And a follow-up for me. Could I ask you to revisit those comments you made about higher selling expenses in PEO? What does that mean exactly? And also just I wanted to make sure I understood that, Don mentioned that, there's some expectations those may continue, but they're still, in essence, sort of a non-recurring step up in expenses. It's not a permanent step up in, in expenses in the segment. Don McGuire : Yeah. We saw higher selling expenses in Q1 for the PEO, and we expect to see higher selling expenses year-over-year in the first half, but we do think that that's going to settle down into the second half. So we're not looking at the kind of growth that we saw last year. I think we commented quite extensively on the many, many salespeople we added into the business last year and had great success and allowed us to finish the year the way we did. So those folks are in place. So we are continuing to add some sellers. We will add though, most of those sellers in the first half and it's important to also, I think, call out here that, what we are seeing with our sellers is that we are getting much better retention within the seller community. So we are hoping and expecting to benefit from the improved tenure that we should see from the selling organization as we go through the balance of this year. Ramsey El-Assal: I got it. So it's headcount-related primarily. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks so much. Maria Black : Yeah. I think it's a timing thing. I think that's the\u2026 Ramsey El-Assal: Got it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jason Kupferberg : Good morning, guys. Just staying on PEO for a second and maybe if we can just refresh a little bit here. I'm just thinking back to the Analyst Day two years ago, we thought it was a medium-term 10% to 12% grower. Now it's 2% to 3% at the moment. There was definitely some post-COVID normalization. But maybe just, Maria, if you want to take us back through the dynamics in terms of just how the business has evolved from your perspective? And is there a potential path back to double-digit growth for this business if the macro is a little bit more cooperative? Maria Black : Yeah. So I'll let Don kind of speak to the medium-term targets and kind of the path back. But I think, from my vantage point, and I said it earlier today, that step one is the continued reacceleration of bookings. And so this is the third quarter that we're pleased and we did have a solid contribution of PEO bookings to the overall bookings picture in this quarter. That was the case last quarter, it was the case the quarter before. And I think the reason that I go to that is not just because it's the piece that will accelerate the growth and path us back to what our long-term goals and medium-term targets are with -- for that business. I think it's also because it speaks to the demand environment. It speaks to the value proposition and the strength of that offering that still exists in the market. And so I think that's a big piece of it. I think step two is the continued acceleration -- reacceleration of retention. So I mentioned that retention has been stable and as we reaccelerate retention back into that growth, that also will contribute to obviously the revenue. And then last but not least, Jason, you mentioned it, the macro headwinds, and I think I talked about the last couple quarters, how that's been the post-pandemic, call it, nuances that impacted that business. I think we talked a lot about the renewal over the last couple of quarters. Now we're seeing these trends in PPC. My view would be that all of the post-pandemic waves that have been, call it, flowing through the PEO and all the variables that make up that model. We're still seeing some of those case in point being really call it the reversion of what we saw several quarters ago, which was when professional services and tech was in a massive hiring boom, now we're seeing the opposite of that, right? So I think we still have some of these waves, kind of shuffling through or whether or going through -- flowing through the PEO. And if and when the macro changes with respect to that, that certainly will help reaccelerate that business as well. So in terms of the path back, I'll let Don kind of speak to the medium-term targets. Don McGuire : Yeah. I think Maria covered it very comprehensively there. I would say that when we established the mid-term targets, I think a lot of things have changed since then, certainly the inflation environment and that we've seen in particular and Maria just mentioned professional services and technology, we saw incredible growth in those sector -- in those segments and growth beyond what we thought we -- or what we had predicted in the mid-term targets or spoken to. I think now we're seeing some reversion. We do, though, continue to be incredibly positive about that business. We think it definitely has a place, and we think that we will make our way back. But as Maria also said, it's a little bit early to forecast when we think we're going to get back to some of those mid-term target growth areas that we had discussed. Jason Kupferberg : Understood. That's good color. Just a follow-up on float yield. It looks like it was actually a tick down slightly quarter-over-quarter here in Q1, amid a higher rate environment. But just curious what the callouts might be there. Danyal Hussain : Hey, Jason. That just relates to the mix between short-term and extended in long. So in Q4, we were a little more levered to overnight partly because of this debt ceiling issue. We had to be deliberately skewed shorter duration. But in a typical Q1, we would generally have a lower short portfolio. And so there is seasonality in the average balance wouldn't read much into it. The year-over-year number is a much more relevant metric. Jason Kupferberg : Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Tien- Tsin Huang : Hi. Good morning. Forgive me, if I'm asking another clarification on the PEO side. Just --what the -- was the slight softness in the bookings also related to the PS and tech sectors and also with the pays per control within PEO, is that more of a healthcare participation issue or just labor weakness in those sectors? Maria Black : I really apologize, you actually blipped out during the first part of your question. Would you mind just repeating -- yeah, there was a word missing so. Tien- Tsin Huang : No, I probably didn't ask it very well. Just wanted to make sure the bookings softness on the PEO side, was that also in the professional services and tech sectors. And then also just on the pays of control, was is a labor weakness or health care participation? Maria Black : Yeah. Listen, so I'm glad you're asking this question actually because I just want to reiterate, we were very pleased with our PEO bookings. And so there wasn't softness, there was strength and growth in the PEO quarter bookings. In terms of how we skewed the year, it was slightly lighter than we had positioned our planning, which is why it contributes the way that it does to the overall worksite employee growth. But, it's -- again, the worksite employee deceleration is really about the PPC story. And so I just want to reiterate, we were actually very pleased with the quarter from a PEO bookings perspective. In terms of the industries, I think it's a mix. I think we continue to see the PEO execute with respect to the industries that we target which tend to be into those categories. As it relates to, this comment around kind of within the PEO, the deceleration that is happening faster in professional services and technology versus the broader base of the PEO. Again, I don't want to give kind of the numbers of what that is, but it isn't like the entire base is sitting in professional services. It's just that subset, if you will, of the base. And it is really, again, kind of triangulate to the macro that we're seeing and the same type of data coming out of ADP Research Institute, out of the BLS and it's really about hiring. So it's less about, call it, layoffs and it's really where the professional services and tech industries, we're doing massive hiring, call it, a year ago, six quarters ago, it's really a lack of hiring that's happening in those businesses. Did I answer that question? Tien- Tsin Huang : Yeah. [indiscernible] Danyal Hussain : Tien-Tsin, just on the participation piece of it, the pay per control wouldn't be impacted by participation rate, but the reported revenue would be. So to the extent, workers are taking plans, cheaper plans or fewer plans. And there's a little bit of that. You do see it in the revenue per WSE, but the WSEs themselves wouldn't be impacted. Tien- Tsin Huang : Thank you, Danny. I didn't ask it. Well, that's perfect. That's what I was looking for. On the -- we get questions around pricing as well. That's why I was asking about the participation side of things and if there's a difference there, it sounds like it isn't. On the international front, just my quick follow-up. Just I think Sweden was the call-out in terms of acquisition. Why is Sweden important to own? Just I'm not as familiar with some of the specific countries that you're targeting. And I'm curious if this is just part of a -- maybe a broader plan to aggregate international payroll. Maria Black : Absolutely. So listen, I have to take this question because I think you may know that I'm actually -- I was born and partially raised in Sweden. So I thought it was prudent to make it the very first country that I announced. I'm actually completely kidding. This was obviously well in motion before my time. But I -- it sounds like I might be closer to Sweden than you are. And for us, it is an exciting time for us. We have had this partnership with BTR for quite some time for us to be able to acquire the payroll business of BTR is exciting because the Nordics are growing, and this does give us a physical footprint into Sweden, which allows us to expand further into the Nordics and really take advantage of the growth trajectory of those economies. So this is obviously payroll, but also in the beyond payroll opportunities that we will have in years to come. So really excited about the acquisition not just because it's near and dear to my heart, but moreover because the Nordics represent growth, and it's exciting to think about us having a physical presence there. Tien- Tsin Huang : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning. You called out strength in ES bookings, particularly in the small business market with RUN. Could you provide some texture into the bookings trends you saw in mid-market with Workforce Now and then up-market with enterprise? And any insights you have into international bookings in the quarter would also be appreciated. Maria Black : Absolutely. So yes, we did have great strength in the down markets, kind of moving on up in the mid-market. Certainly, we have continued solid demand in the mid-market. That's inclusive of our Workforce Now platform. It's also inclusive of our HR outsourcing offering. So I spoke a bit about the ASO models, the HRO models earlier in that mid-market also support -- is supported by the PEO. So we do see continued demand from the mid-market. I think the way I always think about it is not getting any easier for companies in that mid-market to navigate being an employer today. And so we expect continued strong mid-market growth. I think in the up-market, since you asked about the enterprise space, one of the call-outs we made last quarter was about the strength that we saw in our next-generation HCM offering, and we did see that strength continue into this quarter, which we think is fantastic. We also see strength in the pipeline in that space year-on-year. So excited about what we're hearing from our clients, the sentiments around the offerings that we have in the enterprise space. And then I think I touched a little bit on international earlier, but our international business did grow nicely in the first quarter. Again, it was a benefit of a little bit of an easier compare year-on-year. But we also had, as I mentioned, a really strong finish and a strong fiscal '23 in our international business. Again, what I measure is partly the results. But as I think about the look forward, it's really about pipelines and what I would say, our international pipeline year-on-year have a fair amount higher than they did a year ago, which gives us the strength to really feel good about our international bookings to remain healthy through fiscal '24. David Togut : Thanks for that. Just as a quick follow-up, Don, you called out part of the 90 basis point margin decline in PEO being traced to a difficult comparison on workers' compensation reserve adjustments a year ago. Can you quantify for us how large those were as we think through the margin comparisons for Q2, Q3 and Q4 of FY \u201824 in PEO? Don McGuire : Yeah. So as we've had very favorable reserve releases over the last number of years and somebody called out last year in the K, you would have seen the favorability there. So just to be clear, we are still seeing favorable reserve releases, but we are not seeing -- we didn't see the reserve release to the extent that we did Q1 to Q1 of the prior year. So the numbers will be in the Q, but it's about $6.2 million less than it was in the prior year. So that's the quantification of it. And if you kind of translate that into the margin, it's about 60 bps to 90 bps -- 60 bps of the 90 bps decline comes from the lower reserve release. Now once again, we think that we're going to continue to see reserve releases and were favorable as the actuaries get back to us and let us know what's happening, but we're not seeing any underlying changes or large changes that would lead us to be any less optimistic about seeing continued releases in the reserve. Danyal Hussain : And David, sorry, just to clarify, it was a $6 million benefit in Q1, which is about $8 million less than the prior year. David Togut : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open. Mark Marcon : Hey. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. At HR tech, you got to see a lot of your new solutions, particularly focused on, the AI Assisted solutions. Maria, I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about your philosophy with regards to, which solutions you would charge additional for -- how are you thinking about monetization? And then I've got a follow-up in terms of process improvement. Maria Black : Sure. Good morning, Mark. I'm pretty excited about all of our new solutions that you would have seen at HR tech. So I think I'll take a minute to kind of think or talk through how I'm thinking about Gen AI in general, and then I'll tell you how I'm thinking about monetization because I think it'll make more sense on the other side. But when I think about Gen AI, I think it will impact everything. So the answer is it's going to be everywhere impacting everything that we do across the entire client life cycle. So it's about how we develop products. That's everything from developer co-pilot types of tools that everyone is talking about. It's about how Gen AI will be embedded into our product, it's about how we go-to-market and modern seller stuff that I've spoken about for years and how we actually have the ability now leveraging Gen AI to actually acquire clients. And then the most obvious being how we serve them, how we implement them, how we become more productive and make our clients more productive as we serve our clients. And so when I think about Gen AI, and I think most -- everyone has probably likened it to things like whether it's software or the Internet, I think my answer to you is, it will be in everything that we do and in the fabric of who we become. And so in terms of the monetization side, I think it's less about, charging a PEPM (ph) on a per feature. So let's say, you know, some of the things I talked about today, which probably doesn't sound that exciting, like report writing or if you look at the earnings release document, you'll see in there a job description that's pulled in the screenshot showing roles. So these things probably don't sound that exciting, but they're pretty exciting because they are the seeds of innovation, as I used earlier to really show what -- how Gen AI will interact with everything that we do kind of in the fabric. So said differently, Mark, like, I don't think we're going to be charging separately to get Gen AI job description written or Gen AI report written. I think it's really about continuing our innovation journey to do all the things we've always done, which is really about becoming more productive. It's about solving things for our clients and making them more productive. And I think that, to me, the fruits of that labor really end up in new business bookings, and they end up in retention. And so that's not to suggest that there may not be things. But I don't think it's really to me about $0.50 PEPM (ph) here and there. To me, it's really about the innovation journey we've been on. This just allows us to do it at a faster clip. And I'm really optimistic and excited about the things that we're seeing. In terms of other things that we're measuring, we actually have the entire organization rallied to engage in these tools. We actually have some goals that we put out there in terms of -- by the end of the year, how many of our associates that set across sales and implementation and service and technology that are engaging with these tools. Right now, they're sitting at already above 10% of our base of associates that have the ability to touch these tools are already playing with them. I would tell you our entire sales organization are comping up a bit because the digital sales or inside sales where we've deployed a lot of these modern tools over years, have an ability to become that much more productive, engaging our new prospects and new sales. So as you can probably tell, like, I literally could go on and on and on, but I think my answer to you is, it will be everywhere across the entire client life cycle that we have, and I'm very optimistic about the long-term implications of this on all the major metrics that make up this great business model. Mark Marcon : That's terrific. And then with regards to just the productivity enhancement. I mean, particularly when we think about service and implementation, from a longer-term perspective, can you describe how much more efficient you think your service personnel could become? And how much efficiency you could end up gaining there and the implications from, continuous margin improvement as you continue to go along that journey? I know it's early days, but just how are you thinking about that? Maria Black : Yeah. Listen, Mark, it is early days, right? And that's not for a lack of scoping it, right? So we have had because it's not as though we haven't had all of these business cases over many years on how to become more productive, and we've had machine learning and regular AI in our house for a long time. And this does give us a step change to that innovation. But it's still too early. I think to sit on an earnings call and commit numbers, but that's not for a lack of internally having scoping and line of sight to what we believe are pretty exciting goals for us to go chase. And again, some of those goals have existed for a long time, but now we have technology that I'm hopeful that we can actually finally crack the code on some of these really big enhancements that we see. But certainly, productivity is a big piece of it. I know I talked today about Agent Assist and this idea of call summarization. Again, it probably doesn't sound that exciting. But for someone who used to sit on the other side of that, you see whether it's a prospect call or a client call gets summarized and recapped into a very quick format that's usable. These are, hours and minutes of time. even on the seller side, we actually are launching something called rapid pre-call planning, and I think about the hours I used to spend 27 years ago, researching a company to get myself ready to go in and have a conversation with a prospect that brings value, enabling our sellers to have all of that productivity. So I think it's -- again, it's too early to give you exact hundreds of millions of dollars of types of quantifications. But arguably, we are actively looking kind of case by case and really picking the ones that we believe sequentially will be the most accretive to drive the most amount of productivity, the most amount of value back to our shareholders, but candidly, the most amount of value to our clients. Mark Marcon : Terrific. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have time for one more question and that question comes from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Scott Wurtzel : Great. Good morning, guys, and thanks for squeezing me in here. Just on the launch of the construction vertical software. I'm just wondering, is this sort of part of a bigger shift to develop more vertical specific HCM solutions for your clients? I understand, construction may be a more complex vertical, but wondering if there's more of a vertical specific strategy that could develop beyond the construction vertical. Thanks. Maria Black : So I'd like -- what you're suggesting, and I think the answer to that could be yes. And I think when I think about -- back to selling 27 years ago, I used to sell construction companies and the complexity that they have has always existed and candidly, a lot of the features and functionality that we have and are now pulling together to make it an actual solution for that vertical existed many years ago. And that's everything from things like job costing, obviously, compliance and reporting, think about certified, compliance type of reports for payroll, things of that nature. And so it's really about pulling it together and marrying it with a service organization that can support the complexity of that vertical. I think that, to me, is a big change, so we did add some features. But a lot of these things we've had, and we pulled them together and we're marrying it with the ecosystem of a dedicated service org that can actually really help the construction industry and this vertical saw the complexity of being in that industry. So I think what I would offer is that, it's an exciting time for the construction industry, specifically for our Workforce Now clients, and I see this, just as you suggested at the beginning of other places that we could pull together our existing tech with a dedicated type of service model and solve real challenges in the business for various verticals. Scott Wurtzel : Got it. That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up. Just wondering if you can give an update on sort of Next Gen HCM and Next Gen Payroll, attach rates and how we're sort of trending there, relative to expectations? Maria Black : So Next Gen Payroll. That was the question? Scott Wurtzel : Both. Maria Black : Both. Okay, just making sure I heard it right. So I think I touched base really quickly on Next Gen HCM. And I think I noted to the excitement that we have that we continue to see the strength in the Next Gen HCM offering into Q1. So we had a strong fourth quarter. What I would suggest is that we actually brought in more Next Gen HCM in the first quarter than we saw all of last fiscal year. But again, one quarter these things can sometimes be lumpy. But I think for me, it's really about the sentiment. And so we recently had an Analyst Day. We had a handful of our clients up on stage that, shared with us the impact, the platform is making for them. And as you would remember, we spent a lot of our discussions over the last year talking about scaling implementation, on-boarding the backlog. So pretty exciting to see some of that backlog that's no longer backlog on stage, speaking to the value proposition, and that's supported by continued strength which means our sellers are excited to continue to sell the Next Gen HCM offering. So I think that's all very, very positive. Similarly, we have continued focus in the Next Gen Payroll. And so what I would offer there as we continue to make headway. So as it's not deployed across the entire mid-market. We continue to make headway to solve for more complex features, things of that nature, that will pull it further into the upmarket of the mid-market. But as you know, that Next Gen Payroll engine is also what's attached to the Roll offer. So the other exciting part about that engine is it is the thing that's taking us into the SMB space internationally. So I feel really excited about the road map for that offering and the contributions that it's making into the mid-market today, but also into the long-term growth of the company internationally. Scott Wurtzel : Awesome. I appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I'm pleased to hand the program over to Maria Black for closing remarks. Maria Black : Yeah. So thank you, Michelle. And listen, it's hard for me not to sit here and reflect on a year ago. And so I was driving in this morning and feeling candidly a bit nostalgic because it's exactly one year ago that Carlos and I sat here and announced the transition of me becoming CEO of this amazing company. And so I'm incredibly nostalgic and proud today. I'm proud of our first quarter results. I'm really proud of the execution of the team, both with respect to the results, but also with everything that you heard in terms of the progress we are making on a very cohesive and strong strategic outline and priorities. But mostly what I would offer is that I remain incredibly humbled by the -- over 60,000 associates that I've had an opportunity to engage with over the last year who continue to make this company everything that it is and absolutely amazing. And I just wanted to say that I'd like to thank each and every one of them for inspiring me every day. So with that, that is the conclusion of our call and until we meet again. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Michelle, and I'll be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. After the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time.  I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Danny Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Danny Hussain : Thank you, Michelle, and welcome, everyone, to ADP's second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. Participating today are Maria Black, our President and CEO, and Don McGuire, our CFO. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call. During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these items, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, can be found in our earnings release. Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. I'll now turn it over to Maria. Maria Black : Thank you, Danny, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. This morning, we reported strong second quarter results, including 6% revenue growth and 9% adjusted EPS growth. I'll begin with a review of the quarter's financial highlights, before providing an update on the progress we are making across our strategic priorities. We delivered solid Employer Services new business bookings in the second quarter, reaching a new record bookings volume for Q2, and keeping us on track for our full-year outlook. Growth was especially robust across our small business portfolio, and we also experience healthy growth in our mid-market and international business. With steady demand in HCM and a healthy new business pipeline at the end of the quarter, we look forward to the important selling season ahead. Employer Services retention was strong in the second quarter. Although it declined slightly compared to the prior year, we once again exceeded our expectations as we continue to benefit from a healthy overall business environment, and from our very high client satisfaction levels. Our Employer Services pays per control growth remained at 2% for the second quarter. The overall labor market remains resilient, and our clients continue to add employees at a moderate pace, which is resulting in a very gradual deceleration and pays per control growth. And last, our PEO revenue growth of 3% for the second quarter, was in line with our expectations, and we are very pleased to have delivered strong PEO new business bookings that were ahead of our expectations. Based on continued healthy activity levels, we feel good about our PEO bookings momentum, and we look forward to seeing a gradual re-acceleration of our PEO business in the second half of this fiscal year. Moving on to a broader update. During the second quarter, we launched a new brand advertising campaign themed, the next anything. The campaign highlights how the world of work is always changing, sometimes gradually, sometimes suddenly, and trusted business solutions must evolve with it. The theme aligns with our strategic priorities to give our clients the advantage of our leading technology, expertise, and scale. In Q2, we continue to push forward on our first strategic priority to lead with best-in-class HCM technology. A key part of that is the rollout of ADP Assist, our cross-platform solution powered by GenAI that proactively delivers actionable insights in plain language to enhance HR productivity, aid decision-making, and streamline day-to-day tasks for our clients and their employees. ADP Assist seamlessly integrates with ADP products across multiple platforms. Using an intuitive conversational interface, it provides valuable and contextual insights which touch every aspect of HR. For example, in addition to the features we shared with you last quarter, including our natural language reporting capability, in Q2, we integrated natural language search capabilities into our run platform, which allows it to understand intent behind the search terms and use GenAI to mine ADP's deep knowledge base to deliver easy to use and effective content. ADP Assist also helps clients validate payrolls and solve common employee challenges across HR, payroll, time, and benefits. It's a comprehensive experience that is trained on the industry's largest and deepest HCM dataset and our deep knowledge base to surface highly credible and actionable insights so that clients can make smarter decisions.  We are excited about the roadmap ahead for all of our major solutions, and we expect it to help us build on the recognition we continue to earn in the market. In Q2 alone, we were pleased to be recognized for product leadership by three major industry analyst rankings. Everest Group named ADP the highest leader out of 27 providers in its multi-country payroll solutions PEAK Matrix report. NelsonHall identified ADP as a leader in its Payroll Services Vendor Evaluation and Assessment tool in all markets. And Ventana Research named us an exemplary leader across its North American, global, and payroll management buyers guide for performing the best and meeting overall product and customer experience requirements. Our second strategic priority is to provide unmatched expertise and outsourcing solutions. We shared last quarter that we were beginning to equip our associates with GenAI capabilities through our Agent Assist technology. In Q2, we expanded our call summarization deployment to a greater portion of our service associates and started to see productivity gains with shorter handle time and improved service quality. With our global service associates fielding millions of calls annually, we are incredibly excited to test ways to optimize those client interactions. Our third strategic priority is to benefit our clients through our global scale, and we continue to lean into this advantage. In Q2, we announced a strategic collaboration with Convera, a global business to business payments company to help our multi-country clients manage the complexity of global payroll and cross-border payments through an integrated platform. By combining Convera\u2019s payment solutions with our global payroll expertise, we're enhancing the client experience by minimizing the need to access various banking platforms and improving payment accuracy, compliance, and security. We also announced the launch of ADP retirement trust services to support our growing retirement services business. Standing up our own trust services entity demonstrates our scale and commitment to our retirement clients, positioning us on par with financial industry leaders and ahead of HCM competitors that rely on third parties. This commitment can really matter to financial advisors, keeps data within ADP's trusted ecosystem, and provides a cost and price benefit to ADP and our clients over the long term. Our scale also affords us the opportunity to partner with other leading technology providers in innovative ways, and we continue to expand on many of those partnerships to provide our sales implementation and service teams with client-specific insights to quickly address market shifts, drive more personalized interactions, and deepen our overall client engagement.  Overall, our second quarter represented strong outcomes on the financial front and with respect to our key strategic priorities. I'd like to thank our associates who continue to deliver exceptional products and outstanding service to our clients, particularly now, as many of them are in the middle of our most hectic time of year completing year-end work. I'm proud to share that their efforts help drive our overall Net Promoter Score to its highest level ever in the second quarter. Thank you again for all that you do for ADP and for our clients. And now, I'll turn it over to Don. Don McGuire : Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide more color on our results for the quarter, as well as our updated fiscal 2024 outlook. Overall, we reported a strong second quarter, with our consolidated revenue growth moderating in line with our expectations, and our adjusted EBIT margin coming in slightly better than expected. However, the interest rate backdrop has changed since we last provided our full-year outlook, and we are lightly tweaking our outlook, which I'll detail. I'll start with Employer Services. ES segment revenue increased 8% on a reported basis, and 7% on an organic constant currency basis, coming in slightly ahead of our expectations. As Maria shared, we continue to grow our ES new business bookings, resulting in a record second quarter bookings volume. Our small business portfolio and international business provided outsized growth contributions this quarter. And with a steady HCM demand environment and healthy pipelines, we feel on track for our 4% to 7% new business bookings growth outlook for the year. As mentioned earlier, our ES retention declined slightly in Q2 versus the prior year, but again exceeded our expectations. Given our first half retention outperformance, we are increasing our full-year retention outlook slightly. We now anticipate a 40 to 60 basis point decline in our full-year retention, which is 10 basis points better than our prior forecast.  ES pays per control growth of 2% in Q2, was in line with our expectations, and we are maintaining our 1% to 2% growth outlook for the full-year. And client funds interest revenue increased in line with our expectations in Q2, as a slight decline in our average client funds balance, which we discussed last quarter, was more than offset by an increase in our average yield. However, we are revising our full-year client funds interest outlook lower to reflect the change in prevailing interest rates since our last update. We now expect fiscal 2024 client funds interest revenue of $985 million to $995 million, and we expect a net impact from our client funds extended investment strategy of $835 million to $845 million, representing a reduction of about $20 million at the midpoint. In total, there is no change to our fiscal 2024 ES revenue growth forecast of 7% to 8%. Our ES margin increased 170 basis points in Q2, driven by both operating leverage and contribution from client funds interest revenue growth, but reflecting the impact of a reduced client funds interest revenue forecast, as well as a slight increase in expected GenAI related spend, we are tweaking our fiscal 2024 ES margin outlook and now anticipate the lower end of our prior margin range. Moving on to the PEO, we had 3% revenue growth, driven by 2% growth in average work site employees in the second quarter. These metrics were in line with expectation, and we are encouraged to see signs of stabilization in our PEO pays per control growth. As Maria mentioned, our PEO new business bookings were very strong in Q2. With continued healthy activity levels, we continue to anticipate a gradual ramp in our work site employee growth in the back half of fiscal 2024, and we are maintaining our full-year growth outlook of 2% to 3%. PEO margin decreased 50 basis points in Q2. As we shared last quarter, we assume this year's workers' compensation reserve release benefit will be lower than last year's benefit, and we are further narrowing our PEO margin expectation to be down 80 to 100 basis points in fiscal 2024 versus our prior expectation of decline of 50 to 100 basis points.  Putting it all together, there is no change to our fiscal 2024 consolidated revenue growth outlook of 6% to 7%. With the two changes to segment margin, we now expect our adjusted EBIT margin to increase by 60 to 70 basis points versus our prior outlook, for an increase of 60 to 80 basis points. We continue to expect an effective tax rate of around 23%, and we still anticipate fiscal 2024 adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 12%, with the middle of that range the most likely outcome given current assumptions.  Thank you, and I'll now turn it back to the operator for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Mark Marcon with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Mark Marcon : Hey, good morning, and congratulations on all the accolades that you've gotten from the third-party reviewers. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about some of the initiatives. And specifically, one that stood out was the - was setting up your own trust. Can you talk a little bit about the investment there and how we should think about how that would end up unfolding? And what do you think some of the reactions would be with some of your third-party partners? Like, you've got bank partnerships and CPA partnerships and obviously benefit administration partnerships. How do you think they'll end up reacting? Thank you, Maria. Maria Black : Thank you, Mark, and good morning. Appreciate the question and appreciate your well wishes on all of our recognition. Certainly excited to see across the board the recognition we mentioned during the prepared remarks, but also the continued momentum across all of our initiatives. Happy to comment on retirement trust services. It is really a demonstration of our scale. And so, when I think about what it means to our clients, what it means to the ecosystem that you mentioned, banks, CPAs, I think it's all incredibly positive. And trust services are a core component of any 401(k) plan. Given the size and scale of our retirement services business, what we found is that the pool of what's known as third-party trustees, if you will, that are capable of handling a business just of our size, is actually becoming shrinkingly more difficult, if you will, in terms of the number of providers that are able to offer standalone trust services to a retirement offering of our size. So, in terms of that, we made the decision to launch our in-house trust services. We believe that this is a great value to our clients, to the ecosystem. It puts us on par with other industry leaders and the financial services, and really a competitive advantage against some of our HCM competitors that continue to leverage these third-party trustees. So, for us, I think it's a big commitment to the business that we have, the retirement business that is, which really can matter to financial advisors, and as you said, CPAs and banks. Really by taking the trust services in-house, the implication is that we have better control over our costs. Ultimately, that yields a better price for our clients, a better service. We also have the ability to maintain all of the data inside of ADP's ecosystem, which as you know, is a big component of who ADP is in terms of data integrity and all those things. So, that's kind of the retirement trust services in a nutshell, Mark. Mark Marcon : Terrific. thanks for that. And then just, it was noticeable that you basically are anticipating a lower level of decline in terms of the ES retention, which is coming off of record levels. To what extent is that due to an anticipation of lower levels of bankruptcies as opposed to just the improvement that you've been seeing in terms of your client service scores? Maria Black : So, retention is going incredibly well, right? And we mentioned that in the remarks. Year-to-date retention has definitely been better than we expected. And so, I think things are fundamentally really healthy right now. One thing to keep in mind as kind of think about the outlook, is that we are, as you mentioned, we are coming off of some of the record highs that we've seen over the last several years. And while we believe that from specifically a down market perspective, we're close to being normalized back to fiscal 2019 trends, we do also anticipate some pressure in the back half from perhaps out of business and bankruptcies having more of a material impact. We haven't seen it to date, but we certainly want to ensure that we're cognizant of the fact and we believe it's prudent - given that we have retention running at such record levels, we believe it's prudent to plan for it in the back half to have some pressure. And obviously, just like any year, Mark, retention is always noisy until we have some normal variability and conservatism in the back half. Just like you, I'd like to think that there's opportunity there. I think only time will give us the answer to that, but that's kind of how we're thinking about the back half. Mark Marcon : Really appreciate that, Maria. Thank you, and congratulations. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. James Faucette : Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate all the detail this morning. I wanted to quickly just touch on PEO. You called out a strong acceleration in the business, but it looks like outlook for revenues was changed - you may have mentioned that, but I'm just trying to capture how much of that is timing issue versus the concentration you have in professional services and technology, which still seem a little bit soft, at least in the employment reports. Don McGuire : Yes, James, thanks for that question. We've been happy to see the stabilization in the pays per control in those sectors, the financial services and technology sector. So, although there's still a little bit of noise there, it's certainly stabilized from what we saw in the prior quarter. So, that's positive. I do think that as we looked at our sales results, our bookings for PEO, we were very happy with the bookings. Maria mentioned that already very good. I think as we kind of put those together, the improvement in the pays per control and the improvement in our bookings, I think we're going to be heading towards that re-acceleration that we've been pointing to over the last couple of quarters in the PEO. But really just trying to get the impact of those two components, those variables, is really what's going to help us get that re-acceleration going. Danny Hussain : And James, just to clarify, the pays per control, although it\u2019s stabilizing, it's not providing any sort of upside versus our prior forecast. So, bookings are going well. It takes a quite a bit in terms of bookings to really drive a material change to the current year revenue, which you well understand. With pays per control still providing sequential, gradual drag, those two are sort of netting out to an inline outlook. James Faucette : Got it. Thanks for that, Danny. And then quickly on AI, it seems like there's a little bit of incremental investment there and certainly a big focus on this call, but wondering about how we should think about the - how you're anticipating a return on that investment and over what kind of timeframe. And maybe more qualitatively, what kinds of paybacks, whether it's increased customer satisfaction or internal operations, et cetera. Thanks. Maria Black : Yes, so I'll start on the on the AI side and tell you all the reasons again that I'm so excited about it. Maybe Don can give you a little bit about how we're thinking about the return on investments that we're making. So, just to remind everyone how we're thinking about AI, in its most simplistic way, I think about it really in three buckets, the first of which is product and innovation. So, putting generative AI into all of our innovation cycles. So, that's everything from product development to the features and functionality that I mentioned in the prepared remarks. And by the way, later this morning, we're actually issuing a press release that goes through some of our product and innovation, call it, philosophy and launches of products, right? So, some of what this press release speaks to is how we're thinking about and our design principles around making things easy, smart, and human within our product and innovation cycles to really drive things like payroll assist, things like ADP Assist into the market in a meaningful way. So, product is really kind of the first bucket. And as you'll see, we're making significant investments there. We do have ADP Assist now more broadly deployed across the product set, and we're seeing meaningful impact as it relates to our client experience on that. The second bucket is what I call efficiency and service efficiency. And this is really about giving all the same things that we're looking to give our clients to make their jobs easier and more effective and efficient, and giving those same tools to our associates. And so, we have Agent Assist. I'm pleased to say that from an Agent Assist perspective, we've more than doubled the number of associates today that are engaging in AI tools overall. Specifically, a big piece of that is anchored in Agent Assist and the things we're doing around call summarization. Again, I'll let Don comment on investments and return, but just to kind of give you a flavor of what we're talking about here, the feedback we're getting from our associates is, there are times we're shaving off a minute or two minutes by aiding things like call summarization. And while that probably seems minuscule, what I would offer to you is we have thousands of service associates, and we also have millions and millions of calls that we take every single year. And so, we're pretty optimistic and excited about a minute here and a minute there, and what that means from an incremental opportunity for us over time, right? So, we continue to lean into our service efficiency and really getting all of our associates more effective as it relates to their ability to engage with our clients. And then last but not least - by the way, I could go on and on and on all day on this topic, but last but not least and very, very important is how we're thinking about generative AI in our go-to market motions. And so, we have for years been at the tip of the spear of sales modernization. We have partnerships that are two decades old where we've always been leading the way with what it looks like to have a best-in-class modern distribution and sales force, and this is no different for us. So, we already have a broad set of our sellers leveraging tools along the lines of Generative AI, many of which are through our best-in-class vendors and partners that we have, and we're seeing great impact there. Things that I used to do myself at a personal level manually, such as pre-call planning, by the way, things like call summarization for prospecting, these are big items for us as it relates to our go-to-market motions, and we've just started scratching the surface. So, all in, really excited again. Just to kind of wrap it all up, I think it's about product, service efficiency, and our go-to-market motions. We are making active investments. Some of those investments are things that we've shifted that we were already working on in digital transformation. Some of it is incremental investments. And so, I think with that, I'll turn it over to Don who can kind of talk about how we're thinking about our incremental investments and moreover the return on that. Don McGuire : Yes, so I think Maria just outlined some of the exciting areas that GenAI will have for us and some of the things that'll change, how they'll make the client experience better, how they'll help our associates, how they'll help us sell more, et cetera. But I would say at this point in time, what we're really talking about is some modest investments in GenAI. I think it's going to be a little while before we start to see returns from those things, but we certainly do anticipate returns. But in the near term right now, it's really a time for investing in these tools, et cetera, and we'll see those outcomes, those financial outcomes somewhere down the road. James Faucette : That's great. Thank you both very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi there, and thanks for taking my question this morning. You guys called out higher seller expenses as just one component of the margin headwinds in PEO. I guess the question, is this just the cost to compete in PEO at this point? In other words, is it becoming more expensive to compete in PEO, or do you expect expense levels related to selling to sort of abate in a more normalized time period? Don McGuire : Yes, I don't think there's - just to answer the question, there's nothing really unusual or fundamentally different about our selling expenses and how we go-to-market in the PEO. I think certainly as we see higher sales, as you know, we get a lot of our sales, half of our sales, give or take, from internal. So, some of that's a little bit of our internal housekeeping if you will, how we allocate expenses between business units, et cetera. But higher sales generally translate into higher selling expenses. So, really nothing fundamentally different in how we go-to-market. Certainly, not seeing any fundamental differences in the competitive landscape that's driving those expenses. Ramsey El-Assal: Got it. Okay. And then one follow-up for me. In the context of the international product launches like Roll in Ireland, and also I guess the partnership you guys just announced with Convera, can you comment on the international value proposition itself, whether it's sort of largely the same as it is in the US, or are there distinctive products, needs, partnerships required in these markets that you guys sort of still need to build out to more fully execute on the international opportunity? Don McGuire : Yes, I'll start, and Maria can add here in a second. So, as you know, you look at our revenue as - international revenue as a percentage the total, and it\u2019s not where we'd like it to be, even though roughly 40% of the people we bear around world are in international. So, and the reason for that is that we have fundamentally different offers in the US. We have things like PEO. We also have money movement services, tax services, pretty much broadly distributed. Some of those offers don't have the same value proposition outside of the US market. So, our opportunity there is not quite the same. Perhaps it will be as time goes on, some of those services may be available in other markets, but as we speak today, they're not there. The value prop isn't the same. With respect to Convera as a partner, just to speak to that one a little bit, we have thousands of clients, and those thousands of clients have thousands of entities spread across multiple countries around the world. And if you think about the complexity and the difficulty of paying their people in some of these small countries and then getting the payments to the various social security providers in those countries, having somebody like Convera who can help a large European or a large US multinational manage the treasury function in those small countries around the world without having to set up all the banking, et cetera. So, someone like Convera acts as a great partner for us to facilitate those cross-border payments in a very - in a compliant way, et cetera. So, I think that's very positive for us. So, we do have some partners in international like Convera as I just mentioned, but we still see it as a great opportunity for us to continue to grow. Maria Black : That's right. If I may, one of the things, I think what Don is suggesting is really the opportunity we have with international. And so, when you put it in the context of the business that we have in the US there, there is a tremendous opportunity for us to think more broadly in international partnerships as the one Don just outlined with Convera, is a big piece of that. What I would also add is that from an international perspective, we did call out the performance specifically in Q2 on international. That's, by the way, bookings. That's on the heels of a solid Q1. What I would offer as well, we have record retention. We have record customer experience and client experience in international. So, I think we have a tremendous value proposition in international. By the way, some of the recognition I cited during the prepared remarks is really about how best-in-class our offer is with respect to the international offering we have. So, that said, as Don mentioned, we're not satisfied. I think there's more opportunity to us to scale and grow our beyond payroll offerings, partnerships that are a big piece of that, but undoubtedly, we're performing and competing very, very well internationally. Ramsey El-Assal: Fantastic. Sounds like good things ahead. Appreciate it. Maria Black : Oh, you know what, let me just comment because you mentioned Roll in international, so I just thought I'd mention that really quickly, which is, we are very excited about the down market in international. Roll is one way that we're getting after that. And the pilot programs that we're running are teaching us a lot as we think about the down market and international. Ramsey El-Assal: Okay, perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Bryan Keane : Hi guys, congrats on the solid results. Don, I just wanted to ask about average balances. I know we were expecting a little bit of a headwind from the payroll tax deferral. Maybe you can quantify that as part of the reason for the drop of balances down 2%. And then what's the go forward there we should expect? Is there a more of a headwind from the payroll tax deferral for balances and maybe expect a similar decline in the back half of this year? Don McGuire : No, I think you were right to call out the payroll deferral, payroll tax deferral. That definitely was behind the decline quarter-to-quarter. We don't - that's now behind us. So, that's not going to be there. So, we are expecting 2% to 3% balanced growth throughout the balance of the year. So, we think that's very positive. I think the big callout though on the whole CFI program is just the fact that since we spoke last, five-year and 10-year interest rates are down about 80 bps on both of those. And so, I think that's a little bit of the headwind and that's roughly the $20 million or so that we're calling down the float number for the balance of the year. But still very optimistic about growth. Certainly, the reason that it's not growing as quickly perhaps as it did last year, we've certainly seen some moderation in wage growth, and we've talked about even though pays per control are behaving as we expected, they are certainly lower - pays per control growth is lower than it was in the back half, but will be lower in the back half of this year than it was in the back half of last year. So, those would be the major influencers, if you will, to the full balance as we go forward to the back half. Bryan Keane : Got it. And is that part of the moving of the ES margins to the lower end of kind of the range you talked about? I think you talked about rates there. Just what was the surprise from three months ago on rates that that maybe caused you to push the margins towards the lower end or where you think the lower end, the new margin range? Don McGuire : Yes, so, you're right. I think the float certainly is a component of us guiding to the middle of our range, for sure. So, that's a component. We don't try to second guess the markets. We use yield curves that are out there in the market to estimate what we think our returns are going to be. So, no real surprises, other than seeing what's happening in the overall market. And then we're taking the forward yield curves and applying those to our balances, and that's where we land. Bryan Keane : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Scott Wurtzel : Great, thanks. Good morning, guys, and thank you for taking my questions. Maybe just wanted to start off on some trends that we've seen so far in the selling season. Seems like through 2Q it was pretty positive on the booking side, but maybe wondering how we've sort of tracked into 3Q, and then also what you've seen maybe from competitors, any changes in pricing, go-to-market strategy and all that would be helpful. Maria Black : Yes, good morning, Scott. We feel good about the demand environment overall at this point. I think companies are still hiring. We saw that this morning actually as well. And companies are still investing in their people, their talent. They're investing in HR. I think there are a couple things I'd highlight to you. The down market, definitely companies are continuing to hire and they're continuing to buy. We had tremendous second quarter results. By the way, that business has been executing incredibly well really for many, many quarters. And that's our run offering, but it's also all the things that are attached to run. So, think insurance services, retirement services. All of the down market is doing incredibly well. To give you a little bit of a line of sight, because it is the 31st of January, so we do actually have a tiny bit of visibility specifically to the down market. And you asked about trends into the third quarter. What I would offer to you is January looks good. I think we're actually on track to onboard something close to like 30,000 units in that business alone in the month of January. And so, that's the size of some companies, if you will. So, it's pretty incredible to see the execution in the down market. We have solid pipelines really across the mid-market as well as off-market. The mid-market did incredibly well in the second quarter. From a competitive standpoint, I think we get a lot of questions around the competitive landscape. Has it shifted in the mid-market? What I would offer to you, it hasn't really shifted. It's been a competitive space per us for a long time. It's an area for us that we're executing very, very well. We have best-in-class products. We continue to take friction away from our clients, make it easy for our clients to engage with us. We know this based on our results and retention. We know this based on our results and record NPS. We had good bookings in the mid-market. So, I think the mid-market is solid and certainly not getting any easier for our clients to be employers in the mid-market. As it relates to the international space, I think I covered that already, so I won't touch much more on international, but a good Q2 on the heels of a good Q1. And then in our enterprise and upmarket space, this is an area that has normally, I think it's kind of the new normal on longer deal cycles that have more individuals involved in those cycles. We're paying close attention to it and certainly all the things that are happening kind of across that space. But I would suggest to you that we feel relatively solid about our pipelines and our ability to bring that business in the back half. Scott Wurtzel : Great. That's helpful. And just a follow-up for Don, just on the float income guidance, sort of noticed a pretty notable increase on your outlook for the client short portfolio. So, just wondering if you can maybe give a little bit of color on sort of the changing geography on those investments for the balance of the year. Thanks. Don McGuire : Yes, so maybe let me clarify that for you a little bit. So, really, we haven't changed our investment strategy at all. What we have done is we've tweaked a little bit the way we're going to - we were borrowing funds in the market day in, day out. So, what you're seeing is, we're actually entering the market a little bit early. So, instead of borrowing everything we need to on a peak borrowing day, we've simply spread the borrowing out over two, three days so that we can tap the market in a more - in a smoother way, if you will. And I think if you're looking at the average balances on that - on the appendix sheet that's in the release, you'll notice that that number's gone up in the short fair bit, but that's the driver. So, it's not a change in our investment strategy at all. It's just a change in a bit of a tweak in the way we're actually borrowing funds in the market when we need larger amounts of - when we have larger amounts of borrowing. Scott Wurtzel : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Bryan Bergin : Hi, good morning. Thank you. First question I had is on EBIT margin. Can you comment on what drove the outperformance versus your view for that to be down I think in 2Q? I'm curious if that was an aspect of timing within the year versus better-than-expected efficiency. And I think, Don, I heard you mentioned some GenAI investments to come. Is that incremental spend versus the prior plan? Don McGuire : So, yes, let me start - Bryan, let me start with the first part of your question. So, there was a little bit of modest revenue outperformance in the quarter. So, I think that was a contributor to the margin. And then we had some expenses. We always have focus on expenses. There's a few things, a little bit of bad debt, a little bit of headcount, et cetera, and perhaps a little bit of timing, but nothing significant to really call out as a contributor. In terms of the GenAI spend, yes, we are spending a little bit more than we said we were going to last quarter. So, we do have a bit of incremental spend. It's not a huge amount, but I know that lots of folks like to measure things in 10 bps. So, we are calling it out. Not an incredible amount, but a little bit more than we had said in the prior quarter. Bryan Bergin : Okay. And then just I guess a follow-up then on GenAI and ADP Assist here. Is that a feature you're able to monetize directly or more so kind of an enhancement you're offering for free to drive the CSAT stores higher? And I guess understanding you're leaning into these developments, do you kind of view it - when you think about the monetization of GenAI products, is this a near-term dynamic or more so kind of feature and product differentiation that's a longer term monetization dynamic? Maria Black : So, Bryan, ADP Assist is really the overarching, call it, brand, if you will, that we're leveraging to talk through all the things that we're putting into our product to make things easier. The way that I think about it is it\u2019s really just the next phase of digital transformation for ADP using new tools and technology. So, said differently, our intention is not to charge to make things easier for our clients to do business. That is our commitment to our clients, always has been, is to make it as easy as possible to process payroll, to have accurate payrolls. And so, it's not a monetization effort as it stands. It's really about just leveraging the new technology to step change the digital transformation that we've had underway candidly, for many, many decades since the dawn of the computing era. So, that's kind of how we're thinking about ADP Assist. In terms of monetization in general, do I believe there's monetization as it relates to GenAI? Of course. I think it\u2019s more about the dollar long term, right? So, I think about it - the dollars that we're putting in today will yield multiple dollars for us in years to come. So, there will be distinct monetization opportunities as we create new products into the market, as we think about various things of that nature, perhaps features and functionality. There will also be gains in sales and retention that will lead, in my mind, to investments that are proven today in GenAI to drive incremental bookings and retention over the long term. So, I think it's about putting a dollar in today with the belief that it will yield many dollars of margin to come, if you will, as well as bookings, et cetera. Bryan Bergin : Okay, understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is open. Samad Samana : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe on the PEO business, I was curious, I know you guys called out some of the bigger verticals inside of the PEO business and that there's maybe some more softness there than you'd expected in technology and professional services. Any change in the exposure rather inside the PEO business or within like the big verticals? Are you guessing any change in the trends that you saw maybe over the last couple of quarters? Maria Black : The trend in specifically professional services has stabilized. And so, I think Danny made the comment earlier, it's no longer contributing to the deceleration. So, it used to - the professional services cohort used to contribute to the acceleration of pays per control, then we found ourselves where it was contributing to a deceleration, and it's largely stabilized at this time. Samad Samana : Got you. And just as you think about the pricing environment, I know that we're still not at when the company does the annual price increases, but as you think about maybe for new deals or for new customers that are onboarding, any change in the kind of price pressure or competitive nature of what your competitors are offering in terms of discounts or what ADP's is having to offer? And just as we look ahead to price increases, how are you thinking about this year's price increases? Don McGuire : Yes, we're not really seeing any changes, Samad, in the price environment, the competitive environment. We think we're priced appropriately, and we've always acknowledged that we're a little bit of a premium to others. But we're happy with that because we think we offer better service and stability, et cetera. So, no real changes. You're right. It is a little bit early. The budget cycle kicks off here in the next six, eight weeks or so, and we'll certainly be looking at the pricing increases for next year and weighing all the regular factors, what's inflation been? We thought our price increases were very well received last year. We thought they were in line. So, we'll keep that in mind. But as always, we're always interested in the long-term value prop with our clients and being competitive in the market. So, we're always measured, I believe, when we think about the price increases that we do hand out to our clients. Samad Samana : Great. Appreciate you taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Mcveigh with UBS. Your line is open. Kevin Mcveigh : Great. Thanks so much. Maria, I think you talked to kind of implementations a little bit. Can you remind us maybe what percentage of the revenue is done internally on implementations today, and if that's a shift philosophically, what that can be over the course of time? If I heard the remark right. Maybe I picked it up wrong, but just any incremental thoughts on that? Don McGuire : Yes, I'll maybe - Kevin, you're a bit soft by the way, but you're a little bit hard to hear, but I think the question was what kind of revenue we derive from implementation, and is that \u2026 Kevin Mcveigh : Yes. Don McGuire : Yes, so it's not a substantial. Sub 10% of our overall revenue comes from setup - we internally call it setup fees. So, it's not a substantial amount. Kevin Mcveigh : And then do you see that - Don, over time, does that become less if you outsource that? And is there any way to think about the margin impact from that initiative? Don McGuire : Well, I mean, you also - so, no, I don't think there's a big opportunity there. We certainly have had conversations. We certainly have lots of folks who would like us to outsource our implementation because they think it's a revenue stream for them. We like to have that control over the client from sale-through to go live in service. Not to say that we won't work with third parties to help us from time to time, which we do. But it's really not that large a factor. Certainly, there's some money there to be had, but it's not that large a factor in the overall scheme of things. There's also some interesting accounting, of course, around implementation and setup fees and the deferral over the terms of the contract. So, once again, it would take a lot of changes to do anything, make any changes to the bottom-line financials in the near term. Kevin Mcveigh : Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Tien- Tsin Huang : Thanks so much. Good results here. Just want to dig in on your prior comments. I know a lot of people asked on PEO and the healthy activity there and the confidence in the acceleration. Is ADP doing anything differently, or is industry demand changing? I understand it\u2019s not - it doesn't sound like there's a cost of pricing change there. So, I just want to make sure I understood that. Thanks. Maria Black : Yes, good morning, and thank you. I am happy to talk about PEO bookings. I think as mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're very pleased with our PEO bookings. This really is the fourth quarter that we've seen positive PEO bookings momentum, and the Q2 specifically exceeded our expectations. Most of the pressure that we felt in the PEO has been a byproduct of kind of the pressure on pays per control and having to overcome that, which is why the focus on bookings has been so paramount for us. And certainly, we deliver that in the second quarter. In terms of from a demand perspective, I speak about the PEO all the time, as you know. I think the demand continues to be incredibly strong. I wouldn't suggest that there's anything unnatural that we are doing outside of a tremendous amount of focus across the enterprise to ensure that we're executing on the PEO booking side. But in terms of anything unnatural or demand changing, I think the value proposition, as I always say, is stronger than it's ever been. I think clients in that space are looking toward ADP to help them from a PEO value proposition. So, everything from payroll to benefits to navigating the complexity of being a business and having the ability to execute on a co-employment relationship. So, I would say the value proposition is as strong as it's ever been. I think it remains strong. The demand is there. The organization is focused on PEO bookings as an execution lever for us. And I'm pleased to see that we did just that in Q2, and we've really had - this marks the fourth quarter of positive bookings momentum from the PEO. Tien- Tsin Huang : No, that's great. Thank you, Maria. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Caroline (indiscernible) on for Jason. Thanks for taking our question. So, pays per control growth has been 2% quarterly through the first half, but the guide for full-year 2024 is still 1% to 2%. So, what are the drivers of the second half deceleration, or do you think that the high end has become more likely? Don McGuire : Caroline, thanks for the question. We said we would go to - we'd be 1% to 2% for the year, and we certainly have that 1% to 2% range still in the back half. We're not really anticipating any slowdown in pays per control, but we certainly have it built in. So, perhaps we're a little bit conservative there. But as we sit here today, the employment demand continues to be robust, although still declining somewhat, but I think we're confident that in the back half, we're going to be declining a little bit, but still coming in on that 1% to 2% range for the year. Not really much more to say there other than employment demand, labor markets continue to be maybe a bit softer than they were, but as we saw this morning in our NER report, hirings still out there, still good growth. So, not a lot of extra color, I don't think, to add around pays per control. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Your line is open. Dan Dolev : Hey, guys, great results here. Just a strategic question, obviously if you look over the next 12 to 18 months, interest rates are coming down. There is a big debate out there on the ability to offset some of those headwinds in terms of revenue. Can you talk about maybe some idiosyncratic initiatives that you could do to offset the headwind from declining interest rates? Thank you so much. Don McGuire : I think that's really a macro question. I guess the macro answer to that would be that if interest rates start to decline, we'll see an offsetting increase just in economic activity. And if we see that increase in economic activity, we should see revenue go up. We should see bookings opportunities go up, et cetera. So, I think that if interest rates come down - and there's lots of debates, whether it's two cuts or four cuts, et cetera, who knows, but if they do come down, we should certainly avoid the recession. Nobody's asked about a recession on the call today, so thank you. I think the consensus is that there's not going to be a recession. So, certainly any of the polls suggest that the economy's healthy with 3.3% GDP growth in the last report. So, if rates come down, the economy should remain healthy, and a healthy economy should help continue to contribute to our growth. Danny Hussain : Dan, I'll just add also, our model involves reinvesting further out in the yield curve, and as you know, we're still reinvesting at higher rates than what's embedded in the securities that are rolling off. So, even if we do start to see short-term interest rates fall next year, which is obviously consensus at this point, a lot of that will be offset by the reinvestments that we have further out in the yield curve. And so, it's too early to be talking specifically about the interest rate outlook for next year, but we would just recommend you keep that in mind. Don McGuire : Yes, that's fair. I think if you look at our reinvestments, our current reinvestments are still at 4%, which is higher than our average yield today. So, there still are opportunities. Our float is expected to continue to grow over the next 12, 24 months. Certainly, it's going to grow a little more slowly than we would've expected at the end of last quarter, but there's still upside from float, which is perhaps not as much upside. Dan Dolev : Great. Great results, again. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Pete Christiansen with Citi. Your line is open. Pete Christiansen : Thank you. Good morning. Two questions. Now that we fully lapped ERTC, I'm just curious if you've noticed any changes in client demands or competitive tactics, particularly in the down market? Maria Black : Yes, good morning, Pete. The ERTC, as you know, and I think what you're referencing is the new deadline that was pulled forward five quarters actually. So, the deadline actually as it stands is potentially today. I think we're still waiting for the final kind of execution, if you will, of that new deadline. But arguably, we're having to execute on behalf of our clients with today in mind. And so, there's a tremendous amount of volume that we are pushing through on behalf of our clients, and it has put pressure into the system, which is hard to watch and witness, by the way, as it relates to the very clients that are supposed to be helped by this and the challenges that they're facing trying to navigate it. So, we're doing everything we can in our power to help and process these claims. In terms of financial impact for us as it relates to ERTC, it isn't a financial impact to us. I think it's very de minimis as it relates to our overall revenue, as it relates to our overall incremental. We really, from a standpoint of what we're looking toward, it's about supporting our clients. And so, I think some of our competitors have used it more as a business and a revenue than us as it relates to how we're thinking about it. But undoubtedly, the advancement of this deadline to today has not been ideal for really anyone engaged in it. Pete Christiansen : That's helpful. And then I'm curious, the combination of HCM and payments functionality, has certainly been a theme. EWA is obviously a big portion of that and now cross border. Do you see opportunities to increase penetration there or to add more capabilities either through partnership, M&A, furthering payments, and I'm thinking perhaps even like in disbursements, those sorts of things? Thank you. Maria Black : From a strategic standpoint, Pete, what I would offer is continuing to solve for our clients and employees and how they engage with us. If you imagine across ADP, we pay 41 million wage earners in the US. That's 25 million. I think last time we talked about our Wisely offering, what we disclosed was that we had 1.5 cardholders or something like that. So, to just kind of give you the opportunity scale of it, we believe there's tremendous opportunity to increase how we're engaging with our clients, whether that's through the likes of Wisely, it's through the likes of EWA, as you're suggesting, or it's any other type of payments and things that we can do to make it easier for our clients and employees to move through the world of work, right? And so, the way I think about it and the partnerships that we're actively out there in the market talking to and thinking about, anywhere we can add value in our clients and employee life and flow. So, as they move through their day and they clock in through ADP's mobile app, which by the way, we have 10 million users that are actively using our ADP mobile app, so as they're engaging with ADP, are there opportunities for us to insert value there? Whether that's things like EWA, it's things like payments, it's things like financial and wellness apps like the companion app we have through Wisely. These are all top of mind for us as we go through our strategic discussions and as we think about partnerships in the future for ADP. Pete Christiansen : Thank you so much. Super helpful. Operator : Thank you. We have time for one last question, and that question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking my question. So, just a multipart question on PEO and following up on some of the commentary earlier on solid bookings and moderating PPC, sorry, paper control headwinds. As we look at the WSC growth, we have continued to see a sequential improvement there, better than what we saw last year. And just given the commentary, is it fair for us to assume that we should continue to see that improve as we go through the year? And then on revenue per WSC, I was wondering if you could comment on, looks like pricing trends are positive, but if you could comment on any other puts and takes participation, anything else that could help drive better revenue per works at employee. Thanks. Maria Black : So, the answer to your question is, yes, we do expect that the booking contribution, coupled with a bit of stability on the pays per control side, coupled with retention getting more favorable on the back half, all of those things should lead to the re-acceleration that Don mentioned earlier, that we've been pointing to in the back half. I think in terms of other componentry within the PEO, you mentioned a few of them. There's payroll per works on employee. There's workers' compensation. There's State unemployment. Some of these things are things that we're still waiting to really see the outcomes. I'll give you an example. One of those is State unemployment in terms of - obviously, we sit here today forecasting what that looks like. Most of those rates are issued throughout this quarter. And so, while we have some line of sight, in the end, we don't know entirely what the State unemployment outcome - we do expect that it creates a little bit of a - rates are going down year-on-year again this year. But again, only time will tell. Sometimes the States, as an example, make very strange decisions that aren't always in line with what's happening from a broader labor and unemployment perspective. So, all that to say, I think - I don't know that I could sit here today and give you any componentry that seems strange or out of the norm. I think they're all things we're watching as we look toward the re-acceleration in the PEO in the back half. Ashish Sabadra : That's very helpful color. Congrats on the solid results. Operator : Thank you. I'd like to turn the call back over to Maria Black for any closing remarks. Maria Black : Yes. So, really quickly, I think I'll end with how I ended my prepared remarks, which is a huge shout-out to all of the associates and the entire ecosystem across ADP. So, that's ADP associates, partners, channels, all of the stakeholders that really contributed to what was a good, solid Q2, but also a good, solid first half. I'm really excited about the back half and what we'll accomplish, not just in fiscal 2024, but moreover in calendar 2024. It's a time and it's an exciting year for ADP. This year is the year that we actually round our 75th anniversary. And then when I think about who this company is over the last seven decades and 75 years, I can't wait to see what we're going to do in the next 75. So, look forward to sharing in that celebration with all of you as we head into 2024 together. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This does include the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, my name is Michelle, and I'll be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. After the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Danny Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Danny Hussain : Thank you, Michelle, and welcome everyone to ADP's third quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. Participating today are Maria Black, our President and CEO; and Don McGuire, our CFO. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call. During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these items along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release. Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risks. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. I'll now turn it over to Maria. Maria Black : Thank you, Danny, and thank you everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported strong 7% revenue growth and 14% adjusted diluted EPS growth for the third quarter as we continued to make progress delivering against our strategic priorities and as the labor market and the overall HCM business environment remained stable. I'll begin with a review of the quarter's results and provide a brief update on our strategy before turning it to Don to update you on our outlook and share some early considerations for next year. In Q3, we delivered solid Employer Services new business bookings growth reaching record bookings for our Q3 period and keeping us on track for our full-year outlook. We maintained momentum in our small business portfolio with particularly strong growth in our retirement services offering, and in Q3, we also delivered strong bookings results in our midmarket, enterprise and international businesses. With a steady demand backdrop and a healthy new business pipeline, we are focused on continuing to execute for the remainder of the year. Employer Services retention was very strong in the third quarter and once again exceeded our expectations also reaching a new record level for our Q3 period led by our midmarket business. Our overall retention continues to benefit from ongoing investments in our key platforms and from our commitment to delivering an exceptional client experience, which together helped our client satisfaction scores reach a new all-time high for our Q3. Our Employer Services pays per control growth was steady at 2% reflecting the resilient overall U.S. labor market and the fact that our clients continue to add to their workforces at a moderate pace, and our PEO revenue growth of 5% for the third quarter was in line with our expectations despite continued short-term pressure from below normal hiring activity we've been experiencing among those clients. Moving on to a broader update, we continue to push forward on our three strategic priorities, leading with the best HCM technology, unmatched service and expertise in a broader scale to ultimately deliver the best possible experience not just to the buyers of our products but everyone that engages with ADP. We are investing with purpose to deeply understand and deliver value to a vast set of personas from small business owners that count on us to HR professionals and executives of the largest global enterprises to millions of employees and gig workers around the world who engage with our solutions through CPAs, banks, brokers and other key partners to our thousands of dedicated service and implementation associates and to our sellers who represent ADP in the market every day. It's with these personas in mind that we continue pushing forward on our strategic priorities, and in Q3, we made steady progress. Our first priority is to lead with best-in-class HCM technology. We've been rolling out ADP Assist these past couple of quarters, which as a reminder will be embedded in our key platforms and utilizes GenAI to surface insights, aid decision-making and streamline day-to-day tasks for our clients and their employees. In Q3, we were very excited to begin piloting a new feature that enables our small business clients to not only leverage GenAI to answer questions and better understand how to initiate an HR action which we outlined in recent quarters but to actually allow them to issue commands to complete that HR action. For example, users can now type I need to rehire Alex or I would like to give Alex a leave of absence and are expedited through that workflow. Our second priority is to provide unmatched expertise in outsourcing. We continue to extend GenAI capabilities to a broader portion of our service associates, and in Q3, we started rolling out a new tool for some of our implementation teams. Now they can use GenAI to take in unstructured client employee data reducing manual data entry and minimizing errors during the implementation process. While it's still early, we are excited about its potential benefits. Our third priority is to benefit our clients with our global scale. The ADP marketplace remains a differentiator for us and is a perfect example of a benefit our clients receive from partnering with the leader in HCM. As a growing number of our hundreds of partners offer AI-enabled solutions, in Q3, we established ADP marketplace AI principles that require our partners to commit for the same type of responsible AI principles that govern our own products including human oversight, monitoring, explainability and mitigating bias. Our clients put a huge amount of trust in us and this is another example of how ADP strives to ensure the responsible use of AI throughout the ADP ecosystem. We also continued to extend our market-leading global scale, and in Q3, we reached 1 million paid employees on our I-HCM platform, which continues to scale in several countries in Europe and we made further progress in growing our presence in the APAC region, where we have recently been expanding our in-country payroll and workforce management presence in a number of markets. In 2024, we are celebrating our 75th anniversary and we pride ourselves on having built ourselves into a brand that truly matters to employers, their employees and the broader world of work. Our focus on our strategic priorities positions us to deliver more value than ever for our over 1 million current clients and to the tens of thousands of new clients we welcome to the ADP family every quarter. I'd like to highlight just a few of these new client wins from Q3 to give you an appreciation for the variety of ways in which we deliver value for them. In U.S. small business, we had a new Boutique Donut Shop referred to us from one of our CPA partners. The client chose ADP for the strength of our run platform, our reputation for great service, our strong relationship with our CPA and our ability to provide retirement services. Since this was a first time small business owner, our sales team even took the time to help the business owner set up their business the right way from guiding the client on obtaining a state tax ID to making sure the client obtained the appropriate workers compensation insurance. In U.S. midmarket, we won a multistate operator of rehabilitation centers, this client wasn't happy with our prior HCM provider and Workforce Now proved a much better fit. What makes me the most proud in this example is how one of our ADP marketplace partners played a key role in the decision to switch to ADP by independently highlighting the advantages we offered in terms of ease of integrations, a capability we have invested in over the years. In U.S. enterprise, we welcomed a large luxury resort that operates multiple hotels, restaurants and retail stores on site and was dissatisfied with the prior provider's level of client service. The client was so happy following their seamless ADP implementation, which included onsite training for their HR team that they accelerated their plans to add-on features like benefits, recruiting, onboarding, wage garnishment and tax credits. In our International business, one recent win was a leading airline that utilized ADP in certain countries and asked us to help better define their global payroll strategy. Ultimately, they expanded the scope of our services to include in additional 18 countries and started that rollout in the third quarter with plans to add other countries over the next year to enable true consolidated global reporting and analytics. And as a final example, our HRO team started a New York-based design firm after its leadership team recognized the company lacked the HR infrastructure required to adequately attract and retain the right talent. They turned to our PEO offering for truly comprehensive support, attracted by the breadth of our offering including features like the MyLife Advisors program, which supports employees as they make benefit in other important life decisions. We also advise this client in the development of a comprehensive benefits strategy to support their multigenerational workforce and help them attract the talent that they need to grow. As you can tell from these examples, it's often a combination of our technology, expertise and overall breadth that resonated with these businesses, and the result is incredible diversity in our client base and a resilient overall business model. We look forward to leaning in and delivering even greater differentiation in the market going forward. Overall, we were pleased with the strong financial and strategic outcomes in the third quarter. I'd like to thank our associates who continued to deliver exceptional products and service to our clients, in whose efforts drive these client wins and retention. Thank you again for all you do for ADP and for our clients. And now, I'll turn it over to Don. Don McGuire : Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide more color on our results for the quarter and our updated fiscal 2024 outlook. Overall, we reported a strong third quarter with our consolidated revenue growth and our adjusted EBIT margin coming in a bit above our expectations. The interest rate backdrop has improved since we last provided our full year outlook, so we are updating our outlook for that as well as making a few other changes, which I'll detail. I'll start with Employer Services. ES segment revenue grew 8% on a reported basis and 7% on an organic constant currency basis. As Maria shared, we had a good quarter in ES new business bookings with broad-based growth across our client segments. We have a tough compare in Q4 following last year's strong finish but with a steady HCM demand environment and healthy pipelines, we feel on track to deliver our 4% to 7% new business bookings growth outlook for the year. Also, as Maria mentioned earlier, our ES retention exceeded our expectations and increased slightly from last year. Given our continued strong retention performance, we are increasing our full-year retention outlook slightly, we now anticipate a 20 to 30 basis point decline in full year retention which is better than our prior forecast. ES pays per control growth held steady at 2% in Q3 and we now expect growth to round to 2% for the year, the high end of our prior 1% to 2% growth outlook, and client funds interest revenue exceed our expectations in Q3 due to higher average client funds balances and a slightly better average yield. We are revising our full-year client funds interest outlook to reflect our Q3 results and the increase in prevailing interest rates since our last update. We now expect fiscal '24 average client funds balance growth of about 3% and we are raising our expectations for client fund's interest revenue and net impact from our client fund's extended investment strategy. In total, there is no change to our fiscal '24 ES revenue growth forecast of 7% to 8%, although we are now likely to come in towards the higher end of that range. Our ES margin increased 230 basis points in Q3, driven both by operating leverage and the contribution from client funds interest revenue growth. With our strong Q3 results and the slightly more favorable client funds interest rate backdrop, we are raising our fiscal '24 ES margin outlook and now anticipate growth of 180 to 190 basis points. Moving onto the PEO. We had 5% revenue growth driven by 3% growth in average work site employees in the third quarter, representing slight acceleration from the first half of the year. These results were largely in line with our expectations and we were encouraged by the gradual stabilization in our PEO's pays per control growth which decelerated but only slightly from the prior quarter. We continued to anticipate soft pays per control growth through the end of the year and expect work-site employee growth to hold steady at about 3% keeping us on track for our full-year outlook for work-site employee growth of 2% to 3% and revenue growth of 3% to 4%. PEO margin decreased 220 basis points in Q3. As we shared last quarter, we expect this year's workers' compensation reserve release benefit to be significantly lower than what we experienced these last few years, and in particular, last year's $73 million benefit. We are updating our fiscal '24 outlook to now assume a minimal release benefit, and as a result, we are further revising our overall PEO margin expectation to be down 120 to 140 basis points in fiscal '24 versus our prior expectation for a decline of 80 to 100 basis points. Putting it all together, there is no change to our fiscal '24 consolidated revenue growth of 6% to 7%. With the two changes to segment margins, largely offsetting one another, we continue to expect our adjusted EBIT margin to increase by 60 to 70 basis points. We still anticipate an effective tax rate of around 23% and we continue to expect fiscal '24 adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 12% with the middle of that range still the most likely outcome. As we look ahead to fiscal '25, I wanted to share a couple of early thoughts at this point. First, give them the fullness of the labor market, we are planning for pays per control growth to once again be below normal levels next year and to decelerate modestly from this year's growth level in both ES and our PEO segments with the resulting revenue pressure more apparent in the PEO segment given its more direct revenue sensitivity to work-site employees. We will of course share those exact assumptions with you when we give our formal guidance in a few months. On the expense side, we are also planning to continue growing our GenAI related spend next year. As you've heard from us all year long, there are many ways we can put GenAI in the hands of all of the different stakeholders that work with or on behalf of ADP, including our client practitioners, their employees, our service and implementation teams, our sellers and our developers. These are critical investments and they are the right investments for ADP, but we expect the associated benefits and productivity of growth to phasing gradually over time likely representing overall margin pressure for the year. At the same time, we appear positioned for continued tailwind from interest rates, though the extent of this benefit will of course depend on how the yield curve continues to develop. As usual, we're focused primarily on maintaining good momentum in our new business bookings and maintaining our strong client satisfaction and retention and we remain upbeat about our strategy for the years ahead. And now over to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open. Owen Callahan : Hi, this is Owen on for Ramsey. Thanks for taking our question this morning. So, you're currently entering your open enrollment season for client benefit elections within the PEO. I was wondering if you could talk about trends you're seeing there thus far, you called out some stability in regard to insurance price inflation driving more attached rates, are you seeing any of this follow through? Any thoughts there might be helpful. Thanks. Maria Black : Good morning. I was going to say good morning, Owen. How about I start and I'll let Don chime in. I think the comment would be, just to start, we are smack in the middle of our open enrollment season exactly as you suggested, and so, it's probably too early to make a call in terms of what that's going to look like from a full year perspective on the retention side. But overall, we have seen a bit, a tiny bit of PEO retention improvement this year and the compares are getting a bit easier and we do expect some improvement for the full year. So with that, I'll let Don chime in. Don McGuire : Sorry, I jumped again there. So, Maria, thank you. Perfect answer. Thank you. Owen Callahan : Great. Super helpful. And then, if I may, just on client retention continues to sort of surprise to the upside, I was wondering drivers there, I previously thought potentially fewer bankruptcies in the down market but any expectations more longer term might be helpful there? Maria Black : Yes, absolutely. We're very pleased with the overall retention results. I think you see that in our revised outlook, you see that in the revision we made last quarter as well. And so, just to remind everybody just how well retention is going, fiscal '23 was a record, that record was really driven by the mid-market and international and the down market actually did decline a bit in fiscal '23 and we expect pretty much the same outlook, if you will, for full year '24, which is why we still have a down year-on-year retention result, but we're incredibly pleased with overall what we're seeing with client retention, that's really being led by a combination of things, one of which is the investments we made into product, the record results we have in terms of client satisfaction, that in and of itself was a record in the third quarter, along with retention. So, we're very, very pleased with that. As mentioned, there's still down market variability and there's down market out of business. We haven't seen it thus far this year but we still expect it to normalize a bit further. And then there's always normal variability in retention. So, we believe the retention guide is the appropriate one, but certainly we're very pleased with the record quarter and where we sit with retention thus far this year. Owen Callahan : Great. Super helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Zack Ajzenman : Hi, thanks. This is Zack Ajzenman on for Bryan. First question, just want to dig in on the ES revenue growth affirmation despite the higher retention at PPC views, heard that you might come in towards the higher end of the range, but perhaps you can elaborate on some of the underlying assumptions and any offset? Don McGuire : Yes, so a couple of things, Zack. Maria already mentioned that retention is in very good shape for us, so certainly that's been helping and contributing to the revenue growth. And of course what's changed since last time around which is making us even more comfortable with saying we're going to be towards the higher end of the range is that client funds interest impact is very good. So, I think those are the two primary drivers to why we're more confident that we're going to see revenue come in towards the higher end of the seven to eight than we perhaps worth 90 days ago. Zack Ajzenman : Got it. And a follow up on demand ES new business bookings affirmed at 4% to 7% growth, what are the strongest segments of the market and any notable changes to call out versus the second quarter? Maria Black : Sure. So, first and foremost, we feel good about the overall demand environments. Companies are still hiring as we saw today and they're still investing as such in people, in HCM. The call outs, I made a few of them during the prepared remarks, but it's really -- the down market continues to impress us this quarter specifically in retirement services, so I'd make a call out there, it's quite fantastic to see that story and retirement services come together. We talked quite a bit about secular tailwinds in that space based on legislation that coupled with the investments we've been making, an incredible distribution execution, really great to see the retirement services leading the way. I think other areas that I would call out that have been remarkably strong is our mid-market as well as international. And so, again, similar story to retirement services, and that it's really a great story coming together between investments and execution, and enterprise also was strong for us for the quarter. And in terms of anything changing broad-based, we haven't really seen anything change in the demand environment. Quite candidly, we feel really strong as suggested by the overall hiring landscape and the labor demand. Zack Ajzenman : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open. Mark Marcon : Hi, good morning, and thanks for the terrific updates. Client retention obviously really strong, obviously your scores continue to go up. Are there any areas that you would call out that are standing out in terms of driving the higher NPS scores and the higher client retention? Anything that you would particularly note? Maria Black : Good morning, Mark. I would say to you mid-market on both of those. So, mid-market is driving the strong NPS scores to record highs. The mid-market is driving incredible retention. So that's the one call out. You can probably hear the optimism in my voice there because it's a fantastic story coming together, but I think overall retention is incredibly strong. The mid-market international in fiscal '23 were very strong, they continue to be strong, but that's really the one call out I would make is the mid-market. Mark Marcon : Great. And then Maria there's one area that investors have been asking more about and you have -- you and ADP have the broadest outlook with regards to the space, so I'm asking this on the call, but some people wonder a little bit about saturation, your new bookings continue to grow but investors are asking a little bit more about like how much room do we have for new solutions or how many clients have already upgraded, things of that nature? Your results and the results of some of your peers continue to blow their concerns, but I'm wondering if you could address those? Maria Black : Yes, absolutely, Mark. I'll give it a shot and certainly happy to have Don chime in. Maybe he can talk a little bit about our growth opportunity in international, but I think, broadly speaking, when you think about the total addressable market of the HCM space and where we all play and we all compete and it's highly competitive and there's been a lot of investments coming into the space over the past few years. What I would suggest is there's still tremendous amount of growth and growth upside for all of us, and as you mentioned, we continued to deliver that and the results that we see on the new business booking side. And so, I think overall there is still runway, there's still plenty of space. I think the part for us outside of our incredible distribution organization which has always been a competitive advantage in how we go to market, that distribution is also anchored to our ability to upsell to the base. So you mentioned this ability to upgrade and how much has upgraded and are we all the way there? What I would suggest to you is, we're still at about 50% as it relates to new business bookings coming from, call it, new business, net new business versus upgrades, which suggests to me that we still have a tremendous amount of opportunity even within our base. And that's a lot of the focus that we have as an organization, whether it's in the PEO getting smarter about which clients within employer services that we target to offer to the PEO or it's the work that we're doing on generative AI to try to get upsell and offering the right product to the right client at the right time. And in my mind, bending the curve and continuing to focus on attach rates whether that's on the point of sale or omni-attach at a later time is definitely an opportunity for us to continue to deliver bookings in a very broad market that still has a tremendous amount of opportunity for all of us, but moreover, where we continue to execute and deliver on that. So, I don't know, Don, if you want to comment a little bit on international in terms of the opportunity there? Don McGuire : Yes, perhaps to add a little bit more color, I think we're very still very optimistic about growth opportunities beyond the U.S. or the North American market. So, Mark, I think we've talked before we're on the ground in 40 plus countries outside of the U.S. We're present in multiple segments in those markets as well. We've got some great things happening in Southeast Asia where we're rolling out a single platform across beginning in India but many countries surrounding India and the Southeast Asian market. We're excited, we often talk about the fact that we pay over a million people in India, every payroll, every payday. Price points are still a bit low, but we expect those things to work for us and work in our favor in the future. So, I think still lots and lots of opportunity for ADP from a growth perspective and certainly we don't worry about saturation being a limiter to our future. Mark Marcon : That's what I thought. Thanks for -- appreciate the complete answers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Scott Wurtzel : Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to go back to some of the early thoughts Don that you provided on fiscal '25 and talking about the GenAI investments and I think you had mentioned that there could be some margin pressure associated with that, and just wanted to clarify were you talking about potentially leading margin to be down year-over-year or are there other offsets with general operating leverage and interest income that can potentially offset the margin pressure from those investments? Thanks. Don McGuire : Yes, Scott, thanks for the question. I think it's still early. I think the intent here was to give some very early guidance on what '25 could look like. So, we still expect to see some improvements in margins. It's just, do we expect to see as much of an improvement given some of the GenAI pressures, expense pressures that we may see. Of course, CFI, at this point in time, depending what the yield curve does, once again things have changed a fair bit in the last 90 days, and if I was to, not that I have a crystal ball, but I don't think many folks right now are expecting anything to change from the rates perspective in the U.S. before September, so I think we're going to get some tailwinds from that. So, we're not really trying to signal here -- not signaling a decline in our margins, what we're signaling perhaps is perhaps a slower growth in the margins as we look into '25. Scott Wurtzel : Got it. That's super helpful. And then just wanted to go onto the PEO segment and going back to some of the verticals that we've talked about over the last year in technology and professional services, just wondering if you can update us on some of the trends you've seen there with pays per control growth. I mean, even looking at the employment report that you guys released this morning, it looks like professional services is stabilizing and increasing, but technology information seems a little bit choppy. So, just wondering if you can talk about trends in the PEO with respect to those verticals? Don McGuire : Sure, so if I, you know, Maria talked a little bit about bookings, I think, so we've been, we were happy with our bookings. They softened a little bit in Q3, but we had a very, very strong Q2 on PEO bookings. We can move on kind of to the PPC growth. Back in Q1, it decelerated a little bit more than we anticipated, and a significant amount of that deceleration was attributed to the technology and professional services sector. And in Q2, that stabilized. So that was good for us. While there's still some headwinds in PPC, including from technology and service sectors, there were no surprises in Q3. So it's important to note that worksite employee growth accelerated, about 1% over Q2, despite the modest incremental pressure we had from PPC pressure. And so, and that, of course, is a function of the year-to-date booking success that we've had. So nothing really to call out. More stability, if you will, in PPC pressure than we've talked about previously. Scott Wurtzel : Great, thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tien- Tsin Huang : Thanks, good morning. Thanks for going through all this. Anything on the pricing side worth sharing, Maria? Just thinking about some of the peer commentary out there. Any call-outs or interesting observations? Maria Black : In terms of, from a standpoint of our price, or pricing in the market from a demand? Tien- Tsin Huang : Yes, your pricing, or as you're thinking about resetting prices as you go into the usual seasonal time changes, price changes, any thoughts there? So both for new renewals as well as new deal bids? Maria Black : Yes, absolutely. So I think my general sentiments, and then Don can give the kind of a little more directional, but my general sentiments around price remain that we're very thoughtful, and very measured as it relates to how we think about price, whether that's on the new business side, or it's on the renewal side, as you mentioned. And so for us, it's about understanding kind of by segment. So you heard my commentary in the prepared remarks, just how broad and deep and diverse ADP is, with respect to our client base. As you can imagine, we think about a down market, price increased differently than perhaps an enterprise. Some of those are also long-term contracts that have indexes attached. And so all of that lends itself to a very surgical approach, right? To ensure that the price value equation remains the right one, for the market and for our clients. And obviously at the same time, what we're doing is also monitoring what's happening in the HCM space with respect to the peer group and pricing overall. And I would say from a competitive lens, we haven't seen anything unusual as it relates to price from us or the others, even though it continues to be a highly competitive environment. And so as such, our approach this year to price, which I'll let Don comment on, has been very thoughtful and I would expect us to take that same measured approach as we had into '25. Don McGuire : Yes, so the price increase this year was relatively well-received. We're in the 100, 150 basis point range. We're closer to the 150. So happy with where we're at. But back to Maria's comments, we're in the middle of our planning cycle right now, and we'll look very carefully at that whole value equation, making sure that we keep our retention up. Our NPS is supporting that, and we'll make sure that we're mindful and thoughtful about what we do with pricing going forward. Tien- Tsin Huang : Yes, no I'm sure it'd be thoughtful about it. Thank you for that. Just on the GenAI front, I respect the investments there. I'm curious if you were to classify it as either driving expense efficiency versus driving better sales efficiency, what are you really aiming for with some of these investments here for fiscal '25? Maria Black : Oh. The answer is both. So I think it's really about solving for, again, all of the users that interact with ADP, right? So if you think about all the personas, our clients, our clients' employees, and our service agents, our sellers, it's really about putting GenAI in every part of our ecosystem. So in terms of what are we solving for, the answer is both. We're trying to drive greater service efficiency. I think, we've proven out that through digital transformation and taking friction out of our products and making those investments, we have the ability to drive up our NPS results and record client satisfaction tends to lead to similar record retention. So definitely working on ensuring that we're driving up retention. Obviously, the more happy clients we have, the easier it is for our sellers. We're also investing into generative AI for our sellers, to become more productive. So it is about service productivity. It's about seller productivity. It's about client experience. Client experience lends itself to retention. So I guess it's just one happy virtuous cycle, but I think - my answer is both, and all of it is what we hope to gain. Now, again, kind of back to the investments we're making and what Don alluded to in terms of any pressure we would have with respect to margin on those investments. Some of these investments, we know they're the right thing for ADP, but they will take time to ultimately garner all of the results, in all of these categories that I just mentioned. And so, as it stands today, we have some really exciting things that we're seeing. If you think about something, like call summarization that I've spoken about in the past. And we're shaving off roughly a minute per call, that doesn't probably sound that exciting. But you think about a minute per call over time, and you think about how many calls we take broadly across ADP in a given year. The math lends itself to over time, tremendous efficiency, and again, hopefully a better experience, right? So I think the answer is all of it. We're solving for all of it. Tien- Tsin Huang : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, everyone. It's [indiscernible] for James. Thanks for taking our question. Just one for me today. You mentioned coming in at the higher end of the range on ES for the full year, which makes sense given some of your commentary on booking strength, better retention, pace for control, improvement in the float benefit that we're seeing. But given all of those factors, it looks like ES in the quarter came broadly in line with our expectations, despite all of those tailwinds. So I'm curious, given your commentary about price coming in towards the higher end of your historical range, what does that imply just in terms of what you're seeing on the net new side, as well as cross-sell and upsell? Thanks. Don McGuire : Yes, Michael, thanks for the question. I think that, first of all, the price, there's no change in that. I think we've been calling that out for most of the year, certainly in the one to 150 range. So not much of an incremental impact, if you will, for Q4 and therefore for the year in total. So not a lot of change from that. Yes, I mean, bookings, we called out, we're still in the hunt for delivering on the range as we declared, so we're still in that so. But not really a lot to drive incremental revenue, other than some of the float, but as the year shortens or we have fewer months, days left in the year, the impact from higher CFI is going to be somewhat muted as we look to finish the year. Danny Hussain : Hi Michael, it's Danny. If you're wondering whether there is some offset somewhere else, there's a little bit from FX moving adversely relative to our prior expectations. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you both. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Pete Christiansen with Citi. Your line is open. Pete Christiansen : Good morning. Thank you for the question. Maria, you gave great explanation of the wallet share opportunity that still left earlier, PEO, propensity modeling with GenAI and then international. I want to dig into the international side a little bit, particularly some of the newer markets that you're getting into. I'm just hoping you can give us a bit of a progress report on a lot of the last mile infrastructure that, you've been putting in place, go-to-market, ramping that up. And I'm just curious, should we think of like the deployment of PI, the next-gen payroll engine in the international, as a real catalyst - for the next leg of booking growth? Thank you. I appreciate it. Maria Black : Yes, thanks, Pete. I think that was a solid like three, four questions in one. So I will, I'll do my best to weave through it here. But as Don mentioned, we're on the ground in 40 countries. We do payroll across 140 countries, inclusive of our partner network. In terms of the final mile or the last mile, as you referenced, the first thing I would comment on is we've building that 50 years. So when I think about international and everything we've done over the course of decades to build that infrastructure, it's a tremendous lead is what I would suggest. And you see that in our international bookings results, right? So we had a nice first quarter in international. We accelerated that in the second quarter. We had an even better Q3. A lot of that is being driven by our multinational growth. So think about our Celergo offering, our GlobalView offering. These were especially strong for us in the third quarter. And I do believe it's the overall demand environment coupled with - on the ground strategy, if you will, if you will. And by the way, the international pipelines remain healthy. And we believe it's going to position us for a solid Q4, but also next year. In terms of, where we continue to expand. I mentioned it in my prepared remarks. Asia-Pac or APAC is something that, our Asia business has been relatively modest, but we see significant growth over time. Obviously, that growth is a direct byproduct of our clients demand growth, as it relates to the activities of our clients and where they're moving associates, and where they're moving business. So, we believe that continuing to lean into Asia-Pac is important for us. And so as a result of that, we kind of are continuing to lean in there. I think we mentioned last quarter, the acquisition of a company in the Nordics, specifically in Sweden. So that's an area that also is a high growth area from a client perspective. And so I think, our strategy over time has been as we get further into a country and we see the demand, at times we will fold in our partners. And you've seen that obviously in the Nordics, and you've seen that in many countries prior to that. But that ecosystem is vast across 140 countries. Its decades of building that final mile. It's a clear competitive differentiator in the market. You can feel see and it's really palpable on the heels of the last earnings call. I was actually over at our rethink event, which is where we bring together a few hundred of our very largest global MNC clients. And the spirit of how we're executing in that market is really palpable, when you hear it directly from our clients. And I believe it's a tremendous opportunity for us to continue to drive growth. So I think, I covered all of that, Pete. Pete Christiansen : Thank you, Maria. Just quick follow-up. Do you think that the deployment of next-gen payroll is a catalyst for going-to-market and some of those newer markets? Maria Black : Yes, of course. So next-gen payroll, for sure, our intent is to continue to drive next-gen payroll, across various international markets. We have it deployed in a few of our markets today. And that coupled with these offers that again have the lead of Celergo going GlobalView over time, will just further the growth narrative and the story over there. But that is absolutely the intention and the strategic direction of next-gen payroll. Pete Christiansen : Thank you for the comprehensive call. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with the RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. David Paige : Hi. This is David Paige on Ashish. It was great to hear about your results and growth in the mid-market particles. I was wondering if you could just give a little bit of an overview on the competitive landscape there. Are you guys taking share or the entire market or just what's the outlook or the environment in terms of competition in the market? Thank you. Maria Black : Yes, absolutely. So the mid-market is a great segment for us. It's certainly not getting any easier to be an employer in the mid-market. It's littered with complexity and all sorts of challenges to navigate, just even if you look at the last 30 days, you can see legislation that mid-market employers are having to navigate. And so it's a strong market. It is a highly competitive space. That's not new. I think for - from a competitive landscape perspective, it's always been competitive. And I don't know that we've seen a noticeable changes in the competitive landscape. What we have seen is incredible distribution, execution, incredible satisfaction, execution on our end. We've made great investments into the product set. It's winning in the market. You marry that strategy with great execution on the seller side and great execution on the retention side. That, to me, is what's changing in the mid-market is that we've gotten stronger. David Paige : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is [Caroline Lada] on for Jason. Thanks for taking our question. Sorry to double down on price, but just given the way inflation isn't dropping off, maybe the way the market was hoping or expecting recently. Do you have any updated expectations about ADP, and like the broader peer group's ability to raise pricing heading into the fourth quarter, and 2025 without like significant pushback? Don McGuire : Caroline, thanks for the question. I think it just comes - continues to come back to the same concepts, and that's making sure that we offer good value to our customers over a 10-plus year lifespan. So, we're always mindful of making sure that clients are getting good value, and that we keep those clients for a very, very long time. So it's that client life cycle of the total return on the entire life of a client. So, we're always very, very careful not to overstep on pricing. Having said that, we, of course, watch what the competition is doing. We have our ear to the ground. Our salespeople have their ear to the ground. We're trying to make sure and understand what's happening from the competition. So, we will continue to look at it. We'll continue to knock around some ideas, and some models and see what the impact could be. But I don't want to signal exactly what we think we're doing, because we're still, as I said earlier, in the midst of our planning cycle here. But we always look at it. We take price usually every year where we can, not including some of the contractual commitments we have with some of our larger clients, but just something we're very, very careful and cautious about doing shots a lot of color. Unidentified Analyst : Awesome, thank you. That adds a lot of color. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Kartik Mehta : Good morning. Maria, as you look at the mid-market and the success ADP is having, who are you winning market share from? Is it traditional payroll companies? Are there companies that are maybe using other software products that you wouldn't consider payroll companies? I'm just wondering where the success is coming from? Maria Black : Everywhere. Candidly, listen, from a mid-market perspective, again, the demand is healthy. The competitive environment is competitive, and we continue to remain laser-focused on all of the competitors specifically. The ones that have been talking a lot about us over the last few years. And I think the way that we've been focused is really about the investments we've made, investments into a best-in-class product. Investments into focus on distribution investments into a digital transformation that's driving great client satisfaction. And so, that really has allowed us to have a winning story, as it relates to really all of the players. Kartik Mehta : And then just one follow-up. Just on the PEO business, as you look at the long-term growth perspective of that business, obviously, there's been - a couple of things that happened that maybe have slowed the growth down in the last year or so. I'm wondering just your outlook on the PEO business and if you think anything has changed in that business, or demand for the product? Maria Black : Yes. So I'm happy to start and certainly happy to have Don chime in too on the PEO. I'm always very, very bullish on the PEO value proposition. I've been close to that business for a long time, and I will tell you it's stronger than it's ever been. So despite the strangeness that we've had in the PEO, from a kind of the componentry heading into the pandemic, during the pandemic after the pandemic and then now, call it, a little bit post, post pandemic. What I would suggest to you is it has nothing to do with the fundamentals of that business, and what we would expect over time from a growth perspective long-term. And so the value proposition is strong. Nothing from our end has changed there, as it relates to the overall demand from the business. And we see that just in the - we continue to have 50% of our clients into the PEO coming from the base. So it's resonating with our existing clients. It's resonating with the open market, and it continues to be a very strong offering for us. So I don't know, Don, if you want to add anything there? Don McGuire : Nothing to add then the value proposition is as strong as ever, and the fundamentals in the business are continue to be quite strong. Kartik Mehta : Thank you very much. I really appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. We have one more question from Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Your line is open. Dan Dolev : Hi guys, thank you for taking my question. And apologies, I was on a different call. But I know it's kind of maybe early, but do you have any news about - your next fiscal year, maybe something like early views as we head into the fourth quarter? Thank you. Don McGuire : Yes. Dan, just a couple of things, thinking about next year. We do think that it's early, so we didn't share too much, although we did say that the pace per control will continue to be under a little bit of pressure, given the fullness of the labor market. So that's kind of continuing story that we've been telling. We will continue some of our GenAI spending related spending, making the right investments for ADP. And of course, we're going to get some tailwind from interest rates. So I think those are the three primary things. And of course, we always remain very, very focused on bookings and our strong client retention and client experience. So, I think those would be the highlights for '25. Dan Dolev : Okay. Appreciate it. And apologies again if this was already addressed. I was on a different call. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Maria Black for any closing remarks. Maria Black : Yes. Thank you, and thank you once again to everyone who joined us today, whether the full time or late. We always appreciate the questions, the interest, and we certainly look forward to speaking with all of you again soon, and look forward to the close of the year. Thanks. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Michelle and I'll be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. After the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the conference over to Matt Keating, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Matthew Keating : Thank you, Michelle, and welcome, everyone to ADP's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. Participating today are Maria Black, our President and CEO; and Don McGuire, our CFO. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you also find the Investor Presentation that accompanies today's call. During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. The description of these items, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, can be found in our earnings release. Today's call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. I'll now turn it over to Maria. Maria Black : Thank you, Matt and good morning. Before we get started, I'd like to take a minute to thank Danyal Hussain for leading Investor Relations for these past several years. He helped lead us through the pandemic and helped Shepherd our CFO and CEO transitions during his time. With Danny moving on to a broader role, it is my pleasure to officially welcome Matt Keating to his first call. Congratulations to you both. We closed out the year with a strong fourth quarter that included 6% revenue growth, 80 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion and 11% adjusted EPS growth. For fiscal 2024, we delivered 7% revenue growth, 70 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion, and 12% adjusted EPS growth, representing another great year for ADP. I'm excited to share the progress we've made across our three strategic priorities, but first I'll start off with some additional highlights from our results. Our sales and marketing team delivered exceptional employer services, new business bookings in Q4, on top of a strong Q4 last year. This performance was broad based, showing continued strength in our small business portfolio, as well as our mid-market enterprise and international businesses. In fact, we sold and started more than 50,000 new small business clients during the quarter, which not only reflects the strength of our run solution, but also our reputation for commitment to strong service. Similarly, in the enterprise space, client interest in our next-gen HCM solution has exceeded expectations and resulted in strong Q4 sales, and we are excited to continue this great momentum. As a result of this exceptional performance, our fiscal 2024 employer services bookings growth came in at 7%, the high end of our 4% to 7% guidance range. This growth speaks to the power of ADP's unmatched distribution model, which remains a clear competitive advantage for us. With our new business pipeline even stronger than this time last year, we look forward to building on that momentum. Overall, our employer services retention came in better than expected for the year at 92%. We drove record level retention in our mid-market business for the second consecutive year in fiscal 2024. I'm also extremely proud to share that our client satisfaction scores for our total business reached new all-time highs for both the fourth quarter and full year. These results are a testament to the strength of our entire product portfolio and our commitment to supporting our clients. We are confident that these client satisfaction gains will support our retention results moving forward. Our employer services pays per control increased 2% both for the quarter and the full year. We were happy to have seen the resilience of the US Labor market, as our clients continued to hire employees at a moderate pace. Finally, our fourth quarter PEO revenue growth of 6% exceeded our expectations despite continued pressure from slowing client hiring activity. Our fiscal 2024 accomplishments extend far beyond our strong financial results. One year ago, I laid the foundation for our three strategic priorities that will guide our future growth. Now, I'd like to recap some of the great progress we made in each of these areas. Our first priority is to lead with best-in-class HCM technology. We had a very busy year on this front as we launched ADP Assist, our cross-platform solution powered by generative AI that transforms client data into actionable insights. This isn't just another technical solution, it's an experience that combines ADP's deep data set and expertise to empower HR professionals, leaders, and employees. We deployed ADP Assist across several of our platforms, including [Roll] (ph), RUN, Workforce Now, and next-gen HCM, with enhanced capabilities ranging from report creation to natural language search to initiating HR actions. These tools streamline daily tasks and are all powered by an easy-to-use search interface that is already receiving meaningful recognition in the field of generative AI. We are very proud to share that ADP Assist earned the Generative AI Innovation Award in the 2024 AI Breakthrough Awards, and we look forward to rolling out even more features in fiscal 2025. In addition to embedding generative AI in our products, we continued to advance our next-gen initiatives. Our active next-gen payroll client count increased by nearly 50% in fiscal 2024, and we grew our number of live next-gen HCM clients by more than 30% as we continued to improve implementation times. Our next priority is to provide unmatched expertise and outsourcing. Our approach to supporting our clients has been key to our winning formula for decades. And in fiscal 2024, we focused our efforts on implementing new technology that will help make an even greater impact for our clients. To further unlock the value of our expertise, we deployed generative AI tools like call summarization and real-time guidance to support our service associates. We also invested in generative AI and other automation capabilities for our implementation teams to reduce manual data entry and minimize the risk of error during implementation. For example, out of the 50,000 new RUN clients we sold and started during the fourth quarter, about half were digitally onboarded compared to a third of our new client onboarding and run this time last year. And as generative AI capabilities advance, we are excited to further accelerate this progress. Finally, we plan to provide additional tools to help our associates deliver better, faster service and allow our client satisfaction scores to continue reaching new record levels. Our third strategic priority is to benefit our clients with our global scale. Globally, we bring together an unmatched footprint, best-in-class integrated solutions, and industry-leading service and expertise to help our clients and their employees navigate the changing world of work. In fiscal 2024, we continued to leverage this global scale to strengthen our business. We extended our global footprint, acquiring the payroll business of our partner in Sweden, expanding the scope of our Celergo payroll offering to include Iceland, and further growing our on-the-ground presence in the APAC region. Our iHCM platform also continued to scale in several European countries and now serves more than 5,000 clients and pays more than 1 million client employees. Finally, we deepened our existing partnerships with several other leading technology providers to further simplify HCM processes and broaden the spectrum of support we can provide our clients. Next, I'd like to share some new client wins from Q4 to highlight how we're leading in workforce innovation and delivering value for our clients. In US Small business, we continue to successfully onboard new retirement services clients across multiple industry verticals. During the quarter, we added the plan of a Texas-based insurance agency, which was challenged by manual processes and the management of multiple providers. ADP's advanced technology and planned [fiduciary] (ph) solutions simplified the client's plan administration, reduced its manual oversight, and lowered its plan fees. The ADP team made the transition easy and stress-free by providing the client with critical management of the transfer process, as well as regular briefings on the plan set up. This is just one of the thousands of new clients who turn to our retirement services solution every year. In fact, we recently took the top spot as the nation's largest 401(k) record keeper by Total Plans and Total 401(k) Plans in the Plan Sponsor Magazine 2024 defined contribution Record Keeping Survey. We serve over 170,000 retirement services clients and it brings me great joy to see how ADP is helping employers address the retirement savings needs of so many Americans. We look forward to continuing the momentum in our retirement services business in fiscal 2025. In our HR outsourcing business, an orthopedic device company who had grown extensively through acquisition recognized it needed a deeper HR and technology infrastructure to support its future growth. So it turned to our comprehensive services support model to integrate its acquired companies onto a common platform. We look forward to supporting this client's current needs and helping it expand in the future. Additionally, comprehensive services cost a major milestone in fiscal 2024, generating more than $1 billion in revenue for the year. This business has come a long way since its launch in 2008, and we look forward to leaning into our outsourcing business as a differentiator. In US Enterprise, we welcomed one of the largest automotive dealers in the Midwest to our next-gen HCM platform. Following several years of rapid growth, this client wanted to reimagine their HCM strategy. To help, our team went on-site and conducted a deep review of its current practices and pain points. We developed a plan that would leverage our next-gen HCM platform, flexible position management structure and other advanced HCM tools to address the organization's current and future HR strategy. Our initial solution included HR, payroll, time, and benefits, and the client later added recruiting and talent management. We look forward to helping shape the future of their workforce together. Overall, we were extremely pleased with our strong financial and strategic outcomes this past year. In fiscal 2024, ADP was recognized as the world's most admired company by Fortune magazine for the 18th consecutive year, and we also celebrated our 30th straight year on the Fortune 500. As some of you may know, 2024 is also our 75th anniversary. As I reflect on ADP's enduring impact on the world of work, the one constant on our journey is our talented associates, be it the recent accolades we received or the 75 years of support for our clients, we owe our recognition and strong financial performance to our 64,000 dedicated associates who deliver the great products and exceptional experiences and continue to drive our client satisfaction scores to new highs. I want to take a moment to recognize them for their incredible contributions. Thank you for all you do for ADP and for our clients. And now I'll turn the call over to Don. Don McGuire : Thank you, Maria. And good morning, everyone. I'll start by expanding on Maria's comments around our Q4 results and then cover our fiscal 2025 financial outlook. Q4 performance was very strong overall, helping to drive fiscal 2024 revenue and earnings growth towards the high end of our expectations. As previously mentioned, we benefited from broad-based strengths in employer services with exceptional new business bookings, better than anticipated retention, and stable pays per control growth. PEO revenue growth in the quarter also came in better than expected. Our strong Q4 results contributed to our full year revenue growth of 7%, bringing our fiscal 2024 revenue to $19.2 billion. For our employer services segment, revenue in the quarter increased 7% on both a reported and organic constant currency basis. These results were bolstered by a slightly better than expected contribution from client funds interest. Our ES margin expanded 220 basis points in the fourth quarter, which exceeded our expectation. For the full year, our ES revenue grew 8% on a reported basis and 7% on an organic constant currency basis, and our ES margin expanded 210 basis points. For the PEO segment, revenue increased 6% for the quarter as growth accelerated from Q3. Average worksite employees increased 3% on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter to 742,000. PEO margin contracted 240 basis points, slightly more than we anticipated due to higher operating expenses and unfavorable actuarial loss development in workers' compensation reserves. For the full year, PEO revenue grew 4%. Average worksite employees increased 2% and our margin contracted 150 basis points, with the margin contraction mostly due to less favorable actuarial loss development in workers' compensation reserves versus the prior year. Our fiscal 2024 PEO new business bookings growth rate also moderated from the prior year. I'll now share outlook for fiscal 2025. While the macro backdrop remains uncertain, we believe we are well positioned to deliver solid overall financial results while continuing to invest in our future growth consistent with our strategic priorities. Our fiscal 2025 outlook assumes some moderation in economic activity over the course of the year. Beginning with the ES segment, we expect revenue growth of 5% to 6%, driven by the following key assumptions. We expect ES new business bookings growth of 4% to 7%, representing solid growth after coming in at the high end of the same guidance in fiscal 2024. For ES retention, we forecast a 10 basis point to 30 basis point decline from the 92% result for fiscal 2024. We are encouraged by our recent record client satisfaction scores, but we think it's prudent to continue to expect some retention pressure from higher small business out of business levels and slightly slower economic growth overall. As we mentioned at our prior earnings call, we see the potential for below normal US pays per control growth in fiscal 2025. And our outlook assumes 1 to 2% growth for the year. This view is consistent with most economists forecast for continued moderation in US private sector payroll growth. After price contributed around 150 basis points to ES revenue growth in both fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024, we anticipate a benefit closer to 100 basis points in fiscal 2025, which is in-line with the moderation in overall inflation. We also expect FX to transition from a modest tailwind to ES revenue growth in fiscal 2024 to a slight headwind in fiscal 2025. And for client funds interest revenue, the interest rate backdrop remains dynamic. And it's important to remember our client funds interest revenue forecast reflects the current forward yield curve, which is likely to continue to evolve as we move through fiscal 2025. At this point, we expect our average yield to increase from 2.9% in fiscal 2024 to 3.1% in fiscal 2025, which contemplates the market's expectations for short-term interest rates to decrease during the year. We expect our average client funds balances to grow 3% to 4% in fiscal 2025. Putting those together, we expect our client funds interest revenue to increase from $1.02 billion in fiscal 2024 to a range of $1.13 billion to $1.15 billion in fiscal 2025. Meanwhile, we expect net impact from our client fund strategy to increase to a range of $1 billion to $1.02 billion in fiscal 2025. We expect ES margin to increase 100 to 120 basis points in fiscal 2025, driven by operating leverage as well as continued contribution from client funds interest revenue partially offset by ongoing investments to advance our key strategic priorities. Moving on to the PEO segment, we expect PEO revenue to grow 4% to 6% and PEO revenue excluding zero margin pass-throughs to grow 3% to 4% in fiscal 2025. Our PEO revenue growth outlook assumes average worksite employee growth of 1% to 3%. This reflects our expectation for continued new business bookings growth and modestly better retention to be offset by declining PEO pays per control growth that remains below our historical experience. We expect PEO margin to decrease 90 to 110 basis points in fiscal 2025. This anticipated margin decline reflects our forecast for zero margin pass-throughs to grow faster than PEO revenue and increase in our workers' compensation costs and higher PEO selling expense from accelerating new business bookings growth. Adding it all up, our consolidated revenue outlook is for 5% to 6% growth in fiscal 2025. And our adjusted EBIT margin outlook is for expansion of 60 to 80 basis points. We expect our effective tax rate to be around 23%. And we expect fiscal 2025 adjusted EPS growth of 8% to 10% supported by buybacks. One quick note on our margin cadence. We anticipate adjusted EBIT margin expansion on a year-over-year basis to be more modest in the first half of the year before trends ramp in the second half of fiscal 2025. Thank you. And I'll now turn it back to Michelle for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Bryan Bergin : Hi. Good morning. Thank you. I want to start with bookings here. So, sounds like a pretty solid close to the year. Can you provide more color on the attribution of that bookings performance across the business? And in general, I guess when you're looking at demand into July, just any changes based on employer size or geography? Maria Black : Sure, good morning, Bryan. Great to hear from you. I love talking about bookings, especially on the heels of what was truly an exceptional performance by the overall team in the fourth quarter. To answer the first part of the question, it was broad-based. So we did see strength across our growth in small business, mid-market, enterprise, and international. So we are really pleased with the momentum that we see as it relates to the overall receptivity to the offerings, to the product, to the execution, and really proud of how the team moved through the quarter, which led to the exceptional results at 7% for the year. In terms of the demand environment overall and what we see, what I would offer is that the HCM demand environment remains strong. One of the things that's unique about HCM is what we do, it's not a nice to have, it is actually an imperative for a company to run their business. They need to have their associates pay, they need HR tools, and certainly it's not getting any easier. Whether you're in the down-market, mid-market, up-market, to navigate being an employer. And as such, we fit squarely into that. So we feel good about the momentum stepping out of the quarter. We feel good about the demand environment stepping into the quarter. Pipelines from a year-on-year perspective look strong. So we're very optimistic and proud of the performance. Bryan Bergin : Okay, I appreciate that. And then my follow-up, just on kind of pays per control performance here, can you compare and contrast the pays per control performance in ES versus what you're kind of seeing on the same store sale, PPC and PEO. And any cadence assumptions here as you go through 2025? Don McGuire : Yeah, Bryan, I'll take that one. So as we look at pays per control, we do think that the labor market is still pretty resilient. I mean, there are a number of factors that we look to. And, you know, if you look at the BLS, you look at the unemployment rate, JOLTS Report came in the other day, it was down, but better than expected. Labor force participation still got some room to go, et cetera. So jobless claims are kind of neither here nor there. They're benign. So we think there's still continued good strength in the market. Having said that, we do think that pays per control is going to moderate. And we have said we're thinking 1% to 2%, as we go forward into 2025. I would say that we do expect that the pays per control growth in the PEO will be lower than it is in ES, but we are still optimistic that there's growth to be had, but certainly we expect ES to be somewhat stronger than we expect PEO. Bryan Bergin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Your line is open. Dan Dolev : Oh, thanks guys for taking my question. You know just to touch again on ES, like I kind of want to know like how much of that strength is idiosyncratic and things that you're doing internally versus the macro. And then maybe the follow-up is again asking about the guidance and like maybe you can layout you know what could go well and what could go wrong in terms of the macro -- the underlying macro for the guide that would be it. Thank you. Don McGuire : Yeah Dan. So you know just to follow up on that I would say that you could will unemployment remain as low as it has been? I think there's no indication that it's going to worsen. It's still at, you know, decade lows or comparable to decade lows. There is good strength, there seems to be good strength across the broader spectrum of new jobs. So the NER report came out earlier today and we're [continuing] (ph) to see new jobs. So I think that we put out there a PPC growth number that's realistic. What could change that? We could imagine all kinds of macro issues, but I prefer not to do any imagining. I think we're trying to do what we can based on what we know today. So I think that what we have today is pretty good. But as I mentioned earlier to Bryan's question, we certainly recognize that ES is likely to be stronger than PEO. Maria Black : And Dan, if I can just add on the sales side, just with respect to -- are we driving the results as it being driven by Macro? My answer to you would be both. And so I think we have a strong demand environment. I touched on that during Bryan's question in terms of our offer and how squarely it fits into that demand environment. And that's really a broad-based execution across the entire business. So it is the investments we've made into our products. It is the best-in-class service that we have. We see that in the NPS results, by the way we see that in our retention results as well. And so I think we've been getting stronger and stronger. I think the value proposition of what we offer is an imperative for businesses. And then once again, I would say, yeah, we are executing incredibly well across the full spectrum of our sales differentiation. I mentioned in the prepared remarks, I consider it to be one of the greatest competitive advantages that ADP has. Part of that is our ability to canvas the entire market. So whether buyers trying to buy digitally, or they're trying to buy through a channel, or they're trying to buy the traditional way, like we show up at every single turn, and we lean right into that with the best product and the best service out there. And as a result of all of those things, I think we are executing very well. Dan Dolev : Great results, Thank you. Maria Black : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. James Faucette : Great. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask on competition. Some of our recent conversations with those in the industry have kind of indicated that there's been some meaningful price compression from some of your competitors, particularly in the mid and down market segments. Have you observed others getting more competitive on price or from your perspective, is it fairly status quo right now? Maria Black : Good morning James. What I would offer is it is pretty status quo. We haven't really observed any of those meaningful price compression, things of that nature. Given how much we do compete, I think we would see \u2013 I\u2019d say, that there is always some of that in terms of whether it is promotions and things that all of us run at various times throughout the year. But it doesn't seem atypical for me. And obviously, I've spent a lot of years watching the competitive landscape and the sales environment. So I haven't seen anything anomalous. I think the one thing that's changed, specifically in the competitive landscape is us. And so when I think about our ability to execute, and everything I just mentioned, best product, record retention, record NPS, incredible execution by sales. I think we are stronger than we've ever been. So I'd say, that's the shift. But from our purposes, it is still a competitive environment and we lean into it every single day. James Faucette : Great. Glad to hear that. And then wondering if you can give a little bit more color on the composition of bookings, especially between enterprise, mid-market and down market. And also, what are you seeing in the international business? And how should we think about the potential uplift there over time, as price points in lower-cost regions continue to improve? Maria Black : What I would offer is that the down market had incredible strength by the way on top of incredible strength last year. I think I mentioned -- or I did mention during the prepared remarks, we onboarded, we sold and started 50,000 new clients in small business in the fourth quarter alone. So we are officially got 890,000 of our 1.1 million clients are in that down market space. And so we continue just to see broad-based demand. And again, we\u2019re executing very well on that. Our mid-market sales results were phenomenal. Just an incredible execution by the team. Again, our product has been getting newer and stronger, so feel really good about that. I mentioned also in the prepared remarks what we saw in the enterprise space, specifically with respect to our next-gen HCM offering. One of the reasons I'm so excited about this is that we are seeing record results, we are seeing more than we anticipated, quite significantly more than we anticipated. And we are not even at general availability yet. And what that suggests to me is that the market is ready for this offering -- the market is excited about this offering. We see clients wanting to buy in the enterprise space from ADP, and we are stepping into that opportunity. So that's kind of the distribution. Very strong strength. You asked about international specifically. International had a fantastic year overall. So it was really the story of four quarters. I think first quarter of last year was strong over year-on-year first quarter of 2023. Second quarter got even stronger. Third quarter got even stronger than that. And fourth quarter, you'll probably guess got even stronger than that. So overall, our international business had just a fantastic year as well. James Faucette : That\u2019s great. I appreciate all the color Maria. Maria Black : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wonder if you could comment on how you're thinking about the balance -- striking a balance between pricing and retention and just sort of also speak to your confidence level about being able to take that 100 basis points of pricing, which I think is more than you took sort of pre-pandemic, although less than you've been taking in this really inflationary environment. How are you -- how confident are you that you can take that without tipping retention in the wrong direction? Don McGuire : Thanks for the question Ramsey. Yes, it is a great question because we always think really, really hard about pricing decisions and making sure that we don't get greedy. As we've shared on many occasions, what we are interested in is long-term clients and the lifetime value of those clients. So we are always very, very careful not to over rotate on price. And you are right, we have been able to take about 150 basis points in '23 and '24. And as we look to '25 and we looked at the moderating inflation environment, we thought that 100 basis points is realistic. If we go back pre '23 and back into the teens we were more on the 50 basis points range, but the inflation environment was very, very different then it was virtually not existent. So we are confident that we can get 100 basis points. We are confident that we can target it in the right places. So it is something that we think is a reasonable expectation for us to target. Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. And a follow-up for me is about generative AI. And just if you could talk about how we should think about the long-term kind of opportunity there in terms of monetization. Is this ever something that could contribute to revenue directly? Or is this -- is generative AI sort of more something that will drive soft dollars to retention, new bookings? Obviously, there is an expense benefit internally. But I'm just curious about how you're framing it up over the long term. Maria Black : It's a great question. My answer to you would be both. And so from a generative AI perspective, I know you know that I love to speak about it. I talked about it again at length just this morning during the prepared remarks. What I\u2019d offer is that all across, whether it is the focus we have of putting generative AI, ADP Assist across and into each one of our products, or it is the work that we're doing with putting ADP Assist into the market to help practitioners, or help our own service associates and our sales associates, the way I think about it, first and foremost is exactly what you suggested, which is it should feed the ADP model. And in its most simplistic form when I think about this company and driving the recurring revenue model that we have, it is about sales, it is about retention, it is about product efficiency and it's about NPS. And those four metrics generative AI and everything that we are offering as it relates to ADP Assist should feed, call it the machine of our model, right? So we should have more sales, we should be able to keep clients. Why? Because they are happier and they have a better experience as it relates to NPS. And then in turn, we also drive efficiency. So I think that's the output and the outcome of a lot of the investments we are making. That said, as we look at all the use cases and both the short-term stuff that we're working on, as well as the long-term vision of what ultimately generative AI could look like in the coming years, we do see monetization opportunities. And each one of our business cases, as you can imagine, has clear goals of what it is that we are trying to accomplish, inclusive of revenue growth. I think it's too early to start sharing some of those broadly across the market. But certainly, that's a big piece of our strategy, as is making sure that we continue to drive the transformation type of opportunities that we've been driving for years as a company. Ramsey El-Assal: Fantastic, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is open. Samad Samana : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Don, maybe one for you. Just on the PEO guidance, and I apologize if this question is kind of a dumb question, but I just want to make sure I understood it. If I look back to last year, you had actually a slightly better WSE assumption, and you guided to 3% to 5%. And this year, you are assuming lower WSE growth but actually slightly better revenue growth. And I was just trying to reconcile those two things. Is retention assumptions the big difference there? Or is there some other mechanical thing, it is easier comps? I'm just trying to understand the PEO guidance this year versus last year. Don McGuire : No, Samad, it is a great question. So there are a few things happening if you look forward to 2025, revenue is growing, but the biggest contributor to the revenue growth is zero margin pass-throughs. So that's the largest component, and that's what's happening there. And then, of course, we have mentioned earlier that pays per control are under pressure. So as I said in an earlier answer, 1% to 2% for ES, and we think more towards the low end of that for the PEO area. And then we have a little bit of pressure from workman's compensation on the margin. And I guess the third thing is we do continue to focus on the area to get sales reaccelerating. So we certainly have more selling expense baked in to that business to help drive the top-line and make sure we get to continue to grow our worksite employees. Samad Samana : Understood. And Maria, if I take just one huge step back, the business is very strong right now, and it seems like that's happening in what is a backdrop that is slowing. And so I just was wondering, you've been at ADP for a long time, you've seen multiple cycles, can you just remind us that when you see a broader slowdown in the backdrop, just kind of how you still are able to drive value and what the performance of the business has historically been in these slowdown periods, because I think we are all impressed by the durability of the strength even as things may be slow in the backdrop? Maria Black : Yes. Thanks, Samad. And you are right. I think the durability of what it is that we offer, I spoke to it a bit earlier in terms of the imperative of HCM, I think that durability also lends itself to a different environment should the macro change. So the sales force of ADP, if you will our offering is great in times of growth, it is great in times of steady, and it's also great as a conduit as there might be pressure in the employer environment. And so the value proposition, we have a playbook. We can adjust very, very quickly in terms of what it is that we offer and the demand environment -- as the demand environment shift. Now that said, should there be a huge decline in the macro, of course we will be impacted. One of the things that does end up getting impacted is bookings. But at the same time, from a standpoint of the self-adjustment of that value proposition, it\u2019s very durable, and it is very durable, as a result of HCM being an imperative. And so we feel good about our ability to flex. And I've seen that, to your point Samad, I've been here a long time, as a student of ADP's great distribution, and I've seen that flex over time and have all the confidence that the team would do the same. I think maybe Don could also talk about the -- how that financial model, should something shift in the market, the financial model also self-adjusts as it relates to the playbook, if you will in a different macro. Don McGuire : Yes, certainly. We've talked about this before. But if we go back a year or so, I think -- or maybe 18 months, the word recession was on people's lips a lot more frequently than it is today. I think the latest survey I've seen says that there is about a 28% probability of recession in the next 12 months. I'm sure that's some survey that the rest of you have read somewhere as well. So the good news is, it looks very unlikely that we are going to have a recession over the next 12 months. But certainly, as an all-weather company, what we do isn't discretionary. You have to do it. The levers we have, if sales slow commissions slow, if implementations slow, we don't need as much headcount, et cetera, et cetera. But I think, as we saw in 2008, it took a long time for ADP to find itself in a place that looked like a lot of adjustment. So we think that we can use those tools again should we need to. But I'll just finish with hopefully, that survey is correct and nobody is thinking about a recession in the next 12 months. Samad Samana : Great. Appreciate. Have a good day. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open. Mark Marcon : Hi, good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the strong bookings in the fourth quarter as well as the really strong retention. I wanted to dive a little bit deeper into both. With regards to the strong bookings, Maria you cited on the small business side, RUN doing extremely well, getting 50,000 new clients. Can you talk a little bit about what the source of those clients are? Were those clients that were using competitive solutions? Were they brand-new business formations? How would you characterize that? Where are you seeing the strength and the takeaways from? Maria Black : Sure. So on the down market specifically as it relates to bookings, the bookings again are broad-based, right? So where are we getting them? We are getting them from digital inbound, we're getting them from new businesses, we are getting them through the ecosystem of our channels, so clients that are engaging with banks, CPAs. Again, we canvass the entire market. That said, some of the things that we have seen, Mark year-on-year new business formations, it is still at an elevated rate, but it is pressurized. So sorry, year-on-year, it is minus 3%, but it's still elevated compared to norm. And so as a result of that, we did see less coming this time from new business formations. Now we had a lot come from new business formation, but we also saw an increase in balance of trade, some more coming from the competition. So what I would say is mix shifted a little bit in terms of how we broadly canvass the down market. All that rolled up to this incredible result of 50,000 units in the fourth quarter. So it is broad-based, but there are tiny bit of shifts within that to answer your question specifically. Mark Marcon : Great. And then on next-gen HCM, you also mentioned a 50% pickup there in terms of new sales. And this is before you are fully GA. Can you talk a little bit about what the source of the wins are in terms of -- are these clients that are transitioning from older ADP platforms? Or are they coming from competitors? And if it's from competitors, what sort of competitors? Maria Black : Sure. The answer is both and also head-to-head against competition. So some of them are ADP upgrades. We did see more new logos than we've seen before. So we are really excited about the net new wins to ADP. Some of those were wins and takeaways from enterprise competitors. Some of them were wins head-to-head against the same said enterprise competitors, which again is probably why I'm so optimistic about it, because it appears that the offer that we have is competing incredibly well in the market and clients are choosing ADP. Mark Marcon : That's great. And then with regards to client retention, I know you are guiding prudently for a normalization. But it seems like your client satisfaction scores continue to trend up. How would you characterize the primary drivers of the improved client satisfaction? Is it the solution set? Or is it the service underlying, or a combination of both? Maria Black : It is a combination of both. NPS is fantastic. So NPS for the quarter as well as the full year was a record. Almost every single business is at a record NPS. So what drives NPS? It is that both, right? So it is the investments we've made into our best-in-class products. And this is years that we've been making these investments and making our products newer and more modern taking friction out, making them more self-service. All of these things that go into having best-in-class HCM technology, those investments coupled with best-in-class service, is driving the broad NPS record that we have across the business. So as such, that is a direct correlator to a record retention. And so we are really proud of the 92%. You are right. We're prudently guiding into the year again. And the reason behind that is, as you know we've had this conversation many times, is that there is still perhaps some normalization that could happen, and also because we are executing at all-time highs almost across every single business. We just want to be thoughtful as we step into the year to make sure that the retention guide is prudent. Mark Marcon : Got it. Thank you. Maria Black : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tien- Tsin Huang : Hi. Perfect. Just want to extend on the retention, but more on the outlook side, if that's okay. Just any callouts expectation-wise across the segments, small, mid and large? I know you've commented on balance of trade already, but I didn't know if you are seeing anything different in terms of expectations on retention. Maria Black : Yes, fair. What I would offer is it is the same reason that we guided into the year, this year the way that we did, this year that we just closed, it is expected potential normalization in the down market. Now I've been saying that for the last couple of years. It isn't -- yes I know. The down market isn't entirely normalized back to where it was pre-pandemic. Now I get that that's five years ago and it may be at some point, we all have to just suggest that it is the new normal. But we haven't seen an uptick in bankruptcies, out of business at the levels that we used to see in that business. And as such, we believe it is prudent that there could still be some of that normalization. So it's really the same thing that we've been suggesting. It just hasn't happened yet. And our goal would be of course, to not have it happen again. Tien- Tsin Huang : Yes. And you did outperform, obviously the guidance you set last year this time, so okay. No, I just wanted to check. I think this -- again, you've said prudent and totally agree with that. Just my quick follow-up just is on the margin front. I know it is very typical margin expansion. I think you did call it last quarter, maybe a little bit more investment in G&A. Anything different in terms of incremental margin outlook for fiscal 2025? It does look like you have a workforce rebalancing in the fourth quarter as well. So I just want to make sure we call it the puts and takes there on the margin front. Thank you. Don McGuire : Yes. So Tien-Tsin, thanks for the question. I think that we are always -- I'll start with where you ended there. We are always looking at the workforce and making sure we're -- we've got the right people in the right places and the right numbers of people in the right places. So we're always looking at that. I don't think there is any real specific callouts on the margin. I think that there are some Gen AI investments. These are modest, but they do attract 10, 20 bps here and there, so to speak. But they are modest all things considered. Certainly, the margin next year would get a little bit of pressure from lower pays per control from lower pricing increases and from lower client fund interest, specifically -- most specifically in the back half. But I think those are all things that we've called out and you can read through. So nothing abnormal. Tien- Tsin Huang : Yes. No, glad to see it's typical. And congrats to Danny and Matt as well. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Bryan Keane : Hi guys. Congrats on the quarter really strong in ES. On PEO, the bookings were accelerating and recovering in fiscal year '24 but moderated towards the end of the fiscal year. So just want to understand what changed in the marketplace there. Maria Black : Sure. Thank you by the way. I appreciate the congrats. PEO bookings did moderate a bit in the back half. And from a year-on-year perspective, it did moderate as well. That said there was still strong growth in PEO bookings. And so from my vantage point, the demand equation is still incredibly strong for the PEO. It was a slight moderation year-on-year. We feel really solid about the demand for the offer, the value proposition of the offer, and we feel solid about pipelines in the PEO. And as you know, with pipelines in the PEO, it is more about activity in the market, new appointments, requests for proposals, things of that nature. So all the bellwether signals show that the PEO strength is still there, but it did moderate a bit in the back half. Bryan Keane : Yes. And just a follow-up just with thinking what would it take to get PEO back to high single-digit or double-digit revenue growth that was targeted previously? Don McGuire : Yes. Hi Bryan, I think it's going to take a little bit of time. And we were working, and as I mentioned earlier, we are seeing some more margin pressure in PEO, and some of that is because of the investments we are making in the sales force to make sure we can get those bookings going. But realistically, to get to kind of Investor Day guidance that we provided three years ago, it is going to take some time to build that back. So we are definitely focused on that, and we are definitely focused on getting there. Of course, if we were to see some reacceleration in the pays per control, that would put lots of wind in the sails, but it's going to take a little bit of time to get back to where we want to be. Bryan Keane : No, that makes sense. And congrats again. Maria Black : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Scott Wurtzel : Good morning guys. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to go back to the margin guidance and just the context of seems like slower expansion in the first half versus second half. Wondering if you could maybe walk us through the drivers there. Is that more on the shape of revenue, or does it have anything to do on the cost side? Thank you. Don McGuire : No. Good question, Scott. More on the shape of expenses. Revenue expectations throughout the year are pretty consistent quarter-to-quarter. It is really some spending patterns we have in the first half of the year, but really nothing specific to call out. Just want to give folks a heads up that we think we are going to be stronger in the back half than the first. Scott Wurtzel : Got it. That makes sense. And just as a follow-up on the international side. I mean it seems like you're making some good traction on incremental countries and geographies. And we'd love to just kind of hear about your sort of expectations for international heading into this year, how much of it is a priority for you relative to maybe other investments in the business and where you're maybe seeing opportunities internationally. Maria Black : Yes, fair, Scott. It is a very large priority for us. As you may remember, our third strategic priority is to benefit our clients with our global scale. International fits squarely into that strategic priority. We've been building this business for 50-some odd years. We are well ahead of the competition, as it relates to the number of countries that we serve on behalf of our clients, and moreover the infrastructure in those countries that we've built out. So we often speak to the final mile and all the things that we do to ensure that our clients have the ability to pay across very complex, sometimes large complex clients or countries, and sometimes very small complex countries. But certainly, it is a big piece of our offer. I think companies continue to want to think about their system of record from a global perspective, as they continue to have distributed workforces across the globe, as they continue to move supply chains in this world of globalization, as they have remote employees in smaller countries and around the world. We have this incredible network and ability to support clients today in what is 141 countries, and we continue to add more, as they become prudent in terms of the -- again, if it is the growth economies or where our clients are heading. But it is a big piece of our growth story. It's a big piece of our differentiation in the marketplace. And our multi-country MNC business is a clear competitive advantage for us in the international space. Scott Wurtzel : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open. Caroline Latta : Hi. This is Caroline on for Jason. Thanks for taking our question. Can you talk about the duration of the portfolio? We were a little surprised to see that the F\u201925 average yield is expected to be up year-over-year based on the number of rate cuts being forecast. And maybe how you might be adjusting your investment strategy for the portfolio based on the interest rate outlook for the next 12 months. Don McGuire : Caroline, thanks for the question. So we do have a laddered strategy. So if you actually refer to the -- I think, the last page of the earnings release, I think you can see the maturity schedule for our investments. And you can see that, for example in 2025, we have $6 billion that's maturing at roughly 2.2%, and our reinvestment at this point in time is 4.2%. So there's still lots of opportunity, and this is a place where ADP's laddering strategy shows its strength. It is fair to say that over the last couple of years, because of the inverted yield curve, we did have some opportunity cost by having this strategy. But I think we are very much seeing that as yield curves start to normalize, that we still have lots of opportunity for client funds interest growth. I\u2019d just add to that that the portfolio is continuing to grow. It's growing 3% to 4% again next year, maybe not as much as it has in the past couple of years because wages have moderated a little bit, pays per control moderated a little bit. But we are still seeing good growth in that area. So we still have lots of opportunity. And the most important thing here, the most important comment I can make on this whole fund strategy, is that we base all of these commitments or all of these expectations on the current yield curve. We're not trying to outguess the market. We're looking at what the market in general has to say. And we are using those yield curves to put together our forecasts and our guidance on interest rates. Caroline Latta : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. David Paige : Hi. This is David Paige on for Ashish. Thanks for taking our question. I just wanted to circle back to the workforce optimization charge that we had in the quarter of $42 million. Should we expect further workforce optimization in 2025? And if yes, how much of that there, what's the benefit to the EPS guidance for '25 as well? Thank you. Don McGuire : David, as Maria has shared earlier, I mean, we're always looking to make sure that we've got the workforce at the size it needs to be and in the places it needs to be. So we made those difficult decisions that we had to make on behalf of some of those employees. But we always look at this. And if you look at ADP over the years, we've always done what needed to be done to go forward. So I would just leave it at that and say that we're very happy with the guidance we put out here and the margin guidance as well. So we will make sure that we do what we need to do to execute, and we'll see what the future brings. But as we sit here today, we've done what we need to do, and we are looking forward to the future. David Paige : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Kartik Mehta : Good morning. I know you've talked about the strength in bookings quite a bit. And I'm just wondering from an enterprise sales standpoint if there is been any change. Is the sales cycle lengthening at all? Are enterprises maybe asking to buy less modules they have in the past? Any kind of change or has it been pretty much status quo and really no change from a demand or a sales cycle standpoint? Maria Black : Fair. It is a great question. I think we talked about it a bit last quarter and perhaps throughout the year, which is that we're really at a new normal, as it relates to the overall sales cycles. It is reminiscent of what it used to look like pre-pandemic. But arguably, there are more decision-makers involved. The process has elongated a bit from where it was during the height of the pandemic. But the deals are moving through the motions. I would say that they are moving through the motions pretty typically. But certainly, it's not as fast as it was at one point in time. But we're not seeing less modules. We are seeing a big conversation around global, a big conversation around global system of record, things of that nature, which again is where this next-gen HCM fits squarely into that demand. So the conversation shifted a bit, but that is not necessarily new news, Kartik. It's really what we've seen over the last couple of years, as a byproduct of how clients in that enterprise global space operate. So certainly, that's how we are leading what that best offer kind of across the enterprise and international space. But from a deal cycle standpoint, it is pretty similar to what we've seen throughout this year, which is more decision-makers involved and prudency, as it relates to the decisions that are being made, but not necessarily less modules or anything of that nature. Kartik Mehta : And then just on the small business side, I mean as you look at the health of the small business, anything that is changing or anything that would give you concern just as people get worried about the economy, or change in behavior? Maria Black : Yes. Great question. So we monitor so many of these things, right? So I spoke to one of them earlier, which is the pace of new business formation. That tends to be a bit bellwether. Again, it is still elevated from norms, but it is down year-on-year. We are also monitoring our own out of business. We are looking at clients that call it suspend payroll and how many are sitting in that type of capacity. These are all things and metrics that we've monitored for years to ensure that we are kind of seeing what is happening real time, if you will. What I would say is there are little pockets, very similar to the new business formation of kind of watch items that we have our eye on. None of it at this juncture gives us great pause. Quite the opposite. But at the same time, we are monitoring these things to make sure that we don't get surprised as it relates to the shift should there be one. But there hasn't been one yet. Kartik Mehta : Perfect. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Maria Black for any closing remarks. Maria Black : Great. Thank you. So I will end where I started, which is I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our 64,000 associates. All of the results that Don and I have the pleasure of getting on this call to represent, they are a byproduct of 64,000 associates that are all incredibly committed to having the best-in-class technology, the best service, and the biggest, broadest global scale. And everything we do, whether it is from product innovation to our contracting process, to our sellers, to our service associates, it really takes the entire company being aligned on what I would suggest is a commitment to client and client centricity. In that spirit, I'd also like just to take a minute to thank our 1.1 million clients. I will tell you, as we celebrated the 75th anniversary of ADP, it was quite a remarkable moment to think about all the clients that we've impacted over 75 years and had the honor of contributing to their journeys of success and navigation. So definitely want to take a minute to honor all of our clients. And then last but not least, all of you who dialed-in today. I appreciate you joining us. I appreciate your interest and your investment in ADP. And I look forward to speaking with you soon. Operator : Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Michelle and I'll be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's First Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. After the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the conference over to Matt Keating, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Matthew Keating : Thank you, Michelle, and welcome, everyone to ADP's First Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Call. Participating today are Maria Black, our President and CEO; and Don McGuire, our CFO. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you also find the Investor Presentation that accompanies today's call. During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. The description of these items, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, can be found in our earnings release. Today's call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. I'll now turn it over to Maria. Maria Black : Thank you, Matt, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. This morning, we reported strong first quarter results that included 7% revenue growth, 130 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion and 12% adjusted EPS growth. I'm excited to share the considerable progress we made across our three strategic priorities in the quarter, but let me first begin with some additional financial highlights. We had a solid start to the year from an Employer Services new business bookings perspective, with record volume for our first quarter. This performance was broad-based as our small business portfolio benefited from our continued strength in Retirement Services. Our mid-market and HR Outsourcing businesses also showed good growth and our International business maintained its strong momentum from last year. Overall, HCM demand remained steady, and our new business pipelines were healthy at the end of the quarter. Our Q1 Employer Services retention rate exceeded our expectations and only declined slightly. Our overall client satisfaction score reached a new all-time high for our first quarter, driven by improvements in our mid-market, enterprise and HR Outsourcing businesses. Moving forward, we expect our record client satisfaction levels to continue to support our strong retention results. Employer Services pays per control increased 2% for the first quarter as our clients continue to hire employees at a moderate pace. Finally, PEO revenue growth of 7% and average worksite employee growth of 3% for the first quarter exceeded our expectations as strong PEO new business bookings growth more than offset the impact of modest further deceleration in PEO pays per control growth. We are very proud of our strong first quarter financial results and equally excited by the significant progress made across our strategic business priorities. As the needs of today's global workforce continues to shift, employers require dynamic Workforce Management Solutions that will help them maintain compliance and flexibility while engaging their employees. We continuously aim to offer solutions that will solve our clients' complex business challenges. As part of this approach, we recently acquired WorkForce Software, a leading Workforce Management Solutions provider that specializes in supporting large global enterprises. This acquisition expands our current array of time and attendance, absent management and scheduling tools and strengthens our ability to win in a highly attractive market. WorkForce Software is a leader in serving large complex organizations and their robust solutions can adapt to the dynamic needs of today's employers by offering tools that create resiliency, help drive optimal performance and make managing a global workforce easy. We are thrilled to bring together these capabilities as well as their trusted global support organization to broaden our suite of Workforce Management Solutions. Based in Michigan, WorkForce Software serves over 1,000 clients in more than 100 countries, including many well-known global brands. I'd like to officially welcome the members of the WorkForce Software team to ADP. Together, we will continue to drive the future of Workforce Management Innovation, and we are looking forward to all the great things we will accomplish. Additionally, in September, we introduced ADP Lyric, our flexible, intelligent and human-centric global HCM platform. Lyric is the new name for our Next-Gen HCM offering, which is designed to meet the evolving needs of the modern workforce. This is a differentiated offering combining global HR, global payroll and global service to adapt to unique structures and workflows and to offer employers a human-centric approach to managing their people. Thanks to its integrated Generative AI technology and the power of ADP's unmatched dataset, Lyric provides insights and intelligence like predictive analytics and anomaly detection to provide clients with personalized recommendations. Lyric is a global platform. It can support payroll in over 75 countries today and we are focused on expanding its international reach moving forward. Following its successful launch at this year's HR Tech Conference, we are seeing very strong interest in Lyric, and we look forward to sharing our future progress with you. The acquisition of WorkForce Software and the introduction of Lyric position us to provide our enterprise clients with a unique global HR, payroll, time and service solution. We continue to invest in Generative AI capabilities to enhance the experience of our clients and empower our associates. During the first quarter, we expanded access to our robust Generative AI-based service tools, which are designed to bring speed to our service interactions and improve the client experience. These tools seamlessly integrate productivity enhancing technologies like call summarization, virtual knowledge assist, and guided workflows for our associates so they can best support our clients. We expanded the use of these tools to our associates, supporting our small business clients in the first quarter. Early feedback is impressive and we look forward to continuing along this journey to drive productivity gains and even higher client satisfaction. We're also excited to share that we recently launched Intelligent Workflow Automation technology in Workforce Now. These dynamic workflows deliver a personalized and satisfying employee experience at pivotal moments in an employee's career like onboarding, while at the same time dramatically reducing manual work for HR practitioners. This functionality enhances the experience of mid-market clients and their employees on our Workforce Now platform and we look forward to adding similar capabilities to our other HCM platforms over time. These meaningful steps collectively demonstrate our continued focus on our three strategic priorities, which are to lead with best-in-class HCM technology, provide unmatched expertise in outsourcing and benefit our clients with our global scale. We remain confident in our ability to advance our strategic goals, drive our competitive differentiation and deliver strong financial results. And with that, I'd like to take a moment to recognize our associates whose efforts and outstanding performance are positioning us to consistently deliver for our clients and our shareholders. Thank you all. And now, I'll turn it over to Don. Don McGuire : Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some more color on our results for the first quarter and then update our fiscal 2025 outlook, which now includes our WorkForce Software acquisition and our recent debt issuance. Let me begin with our Employer Services results and outlook. ES segment revenue increased 7% on both a reported basis and organic constant currency basis coming in ahead of our expectations. As Maria shared, ES new business bookings were solid to start the year. With a stable demand backdrop and healthy pipelines, we are maintaining our 4% to 7% full year growth guidance. ES retention declined slightly in Q1 versus the prior year, but still came in modestly better-than-anticipated. We are continuing to forecast a 10 basis point to 30 basis point decline in full year retention based on an expected increase in small business losses due to higher out of business rates. ES pays per control growth of 2% met our expectation for the quarter and we continue to forecast 1% to 2% growth for the full year. Client funds interest revenue increased a bit more than we anticipated in Q1, helped by stronger average client funds balance growth. While the yield curve has broadly declined since our last update, this impact is partially offset by our stronger client funds balance growth. For the full year, we are reducing our client funds interest revenue forecast by $10 million. However, we are maintaining our net impact from client funds extended investment strategy forecast as lower reinvestment rates are almost entirely offset by lower average borrowing costs. Based on our Q1 ES revenue growth performance and the expected contribution from the WorkForce Software acquisition, we are increasing our fiscal 2025 ES revenue growth range to 6% to 7%. Our ES margin increased 260 basis points in Q1, driven by both operating leverage and continued client funds interest revenue growth. On a full year basis, we're adjusting our ES margin outlook to incorporate the expected impact of the acquisition and now forecast an increase of 40 to 60 basis points for fiscal 2025. Moving on to the PEO, revenue growth of 7% and average worksite employee growth of 3% exceeded our expectations. As Maria mentioned, strong PEO new business bookings growth more than offset the impact of further modest deceleration in PEO pays per control growth. As a result, we now expect fiscal 2025 PEO revenue growth of 5% to 6% and average worksite employee growth of 2% to 3%, which at the midpoint of the ranges are each up 50 basis points from our prior forecasts. We continue to expect PEO pays per control growth to be slower than ES pays per control growth in fiscal 2025. PEO margin decreased 80 basis points in Q1, which is less than we anticipated due primarily to stronger revenue growth. The margin decline versus last year stemmed mainly from higher workers compensation program costs and higher zero margin benefits pass-through revenue growth. We now expect PEO margin to be down between 70 and 90 basis points in fiscal '25, which is 20 basis points better than our prior outlook. Putting it all together, we are increasing our fiscal 2025 consolidated revenue growth forecast to 6% to 7%. While we anticipate future revenue synergies from the WorkForce Software acquisition, we expect it to pressure our adjusted EBIT margin this fiscal year. We now forecast full year adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 30 to 50 basis points. In addition, in September, we enhanced our capital structure by issuing $1 billion in 10 year notes. And subsequently, our corporate interest expense will increase by about $40 million for fiscal 2025. We continue to expect a full year effective tax rate of around 23%. After incorporating the anticipated impacts of the acquisition and our recent debt issuance, we now forecast 7% to 9% adjusted EPS growth for fiscal 2025. Thank you. And I'll now turn it back to Michelle for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Zack Ajzenman : This is Zack Ajzenman on for Bryan. First question is on Employer Services, just the demand and bookings backdrop. If you can just dig into the areas of strength in Q1 and kind of how it progressed through the quarter? And then we have a follow-up. Maria Black : Sure. Good morning, Zach. Thanks for joining us today. So demand overall, we feel good about it. We feel good about the HCM demand. We had a great sales quarter. We have a great sales and marketing organization. It was solid and it was broad-based. I think from a demand perspective, I called out a few areas of strength, one of which is the Retirement Services offering in our down market. We continue to execute there against opportunity and our strategy. And so excited to see them continue the great progress. Certainly in the mid-market, our HR Outsourcing offerings as well. And then we saw continued strength in International. I think that's a great story on the heels of the strength that we saw in International all four quarters last year. So really pleased with the broad-based result. And I think the demand remains pretty consistent. I think the down-market, companies are still hiring and they're buying. I think in the mid-market, certainly not getting any easier. It's still very complex. We do also have those offerings beyond tech-only in the mid-market that extend our reach into the HR Outsourcing offerings. And you heard the PEO result was solid as well. So and again, we're always watching what's happening in the global space, which is why we continue to be as pleased as we are with the execution on new business bookings in International. Zack Ajzenman : Got it. And then a follow-up on PEO retention. So it sounds like worksite employee retention came in above plan in Q1. As we think about the balance of the year, are you still anticipating an improvement in PEO worksite employee retention year-over-year growth for fiscal '25? And is it an offset -- enough to offset the decel and pays per control? Maria Black : So the biggest contributor to the outperformance in worksite employees, average worksite employees was really bookings, right. So we did have a strong first quarter, albeit the first quarter for PEO is generally relatively light on the year, so we still have to execute that. And that is the focus. We've been laser-focused on accelerating PEO new business bookings that remains to be the case. That was the biggest contributor and that is the piece that can really overcome the deceleration in worksite employee pays per control or PEO pays per control. Retention does contribute. It contributes very modestly compared to new business bookings. That's really what we saw in fiscal '24 as well. We saw that retention was year-on-year up, but only contributed modestly and that's really what we expect for '25 as well. Zack Ajzenman : Thank you. Don McGuire : Yes. Maybe just to add some color to the -- maybe just add a little bit of color to that in terms of the pays per control growth, we do expect to see pays per control growth lower in PEO than in Employer Services. That's what we called out at the outset of the year. We're going to talk about, ES, I'm sure, later. But PEO is definitely showing growth but slowing growth. Zack Ajzenman : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. David Paige : Hi. Good morning. This is David Paige on for Ashish. Thanks for taking our question. I was wondering if we could double-click on the WorkForce Software business, maybe what's the financial profile in terms of revenue growth the annualized revenue and the margin profile? And then a follow-up after that. Thank you. Maria Black : Yes. So David maybe I'll let Don talk through the financial element, but maybe before we do that, it's prudent to just kind of comment on the strategic rationale behind the acquisition. As you can imagine, we're pretty excited to have the opportunity to speak to it today. This is a company WorkForce Software that we've been aware of for quite some time, aware of their capabilities, aware of how they're able to support some very marquee clients. I think we talked about in the prepared remarks, they have, they serve about 1,000 companies around the world. These are marquee well-known global brands. So we're really excited about the product set. We're excited about the clients. But I have to tell you too, we're pretty excited about the organization as a whole. I was out there on October 15th, a couple of weeks ago for day one. And in addition to a fantastic product and a pretty marquee set of clients, it's also an incredible team. It's a great team with great domain expertise in this space. And so we're really excited to add this deep expertise to ADP's overall Workforce Management Solutions and how we incorporate that with our organization to really drive further opportunities. So this is a growth story for us about the future and we're pretty strategically excited about it. But with that, I'll let Don kind of walk you through the financial implications. Don McGuire : Yes. So, David, I expect we're going to get this question later on. So maybe I'll just elaborate a little bit more on the impact of the WorkForce Software acquisition. So if you look at the -- we took up our revenue expectation, but on the ES side. Out of the 1% increase to our consolidated FY'25 revenue growth outlook, about half of that is coming from WorkForce Software and the remainder is coming from the strong results in the rest of the business. We had a good first quarter. And we're certainly expecting to see strength throughout the balance of the year as well. And this is certainly more a strategic transaction for us, as Maria just went through, gives us the ability to serve complex global companies with a much broader offer now HCM payroll service and now time to attendance or Workforce Management in that marketplace. And so when we move on and look at some of the additional expenses and some of the things that are causing some drag on our EPS expectations, we only closed the transaction about two weeks ago. So we're not going to be terribly precise on this point. So we do expect some modest pressure. It's important to remember the biggest pieces through are coming from debt intangibles, integration of the deal cost itself. So nothing unusual. I do want to point out that this is a very, it's a relatively small company with a relatively large capability. And when I say that, we're not expecting a significant amount of expense synergies from this transaction because they run themselves pretty lean and they're pretty effective. And then when you move on and you look at what we did in our -- to the midpoint of our ES margin and our adjusted EBIT margin were down 60 and 30 points respectively. And so the question could be is that all from WorkForce Software's anticipated drag? And the answer is actually more of the drag is coming from WorkForce Software. So the other businesses are compensating somewhat for that. So we do anticipate about a 0.5 point of EBIT margin pressure as a result of the transaction in fiscal '25. So if you -- if we look at the EPS growth as well, it's expected to be a bit more than 1% of the drag. So we've outperformed in other parts of the business, so we overcome some of that. And as I said earlier, most of the dilution is coming from integration costs, amortization of intangibles and interest expense. And then I'll jump ahead of the anticipated question I have and that is when do we think this is going to be accretive to ADP? And I think the short answer is, give us a couple of quarters to get things in line and we'll come back and we'll be very excited about sharing success stories and client wins over the next couple of quarters, but it's a bit early given this transaction only closed about two weeks ago. David Paige : That's great. Very comprehensive for me. That's it for me. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open. Mark Marcon : Good morning and thanks for the questions. First of all, congratulations on the first quarter results, really strong particularly. Maria, you mentioned client satisfaction scores are at all-time highs. Can you talk a little bit about some of the factors that drove that? And then I'd like to do a follow-up on WorkForce Software. Maria Black : Yes. Good morning, Mark, and thank you very much for the congratulations. We're pretty excited about the quarter as well. To the NPS question that you had. So what I mentioned in the prepared remarks is we had an all-time high for a first quarter. And we did see strength. Again, it was broad-based. I think some of the call-outs that we've been making over the last couple of years, specifically as it relates to the business that really has been broad-based and it's been near record levels really kind of across the various businesses. I think we've talked quite a bit about the mid-market. We've talked about the last couple of years that we've been speaking to the mid-market. A lot of that mark comes from the investments we've been making in product, the investments we've been making in some of the tools that we provide to our service organization. I mentioned some of those as we extend the reach into the product and in Workforce Now. During the remarks, I also mentioned some of the other work that we've done in SBS specifically, the extension of Generative AI tools into the SBS service organization. And again, the thesis behind it and what it's proving itself to be true is the more we invest in making things easy for our clients and frictionless, the greater our NPS results, and it seems to be resulting in pretty favorable retention results as well. So from an NPS perspective, on a year-on-year basis, just kind of rounded out. We did see the mid-market, enterprise and HR Outsourcing businesses from a year-on-year perspective kind of have those biggest improvements, but from a broad-based perspective, I would say almost every business is at record levels. And year-on-year, it was a record for a first quarter. Mark Marcon : Got it. We had a chance to demo the WalkMe tool within Lyric and that was pretty impressive. I imagine that's going to end up continuing the upward surge in terms of the NPS. Wondering with regards to WorkForce Software. What's the integration plan? I mean the strategic rationale seems fairly obvious. But just how long -- how soon will we be able to see you fully integrate them in terms of a go-to-market plan? When will you start doing joint sales? How much of their client base, which does include similar marquees already ADP clients? What are the opportunities with regards to potentially penetrating some of those that aren't? Can you talk a little bit about whether it's going to be domestic as well as international in terms of when you go to market and how quickly you can do that? Maria Black : Yes, sure. By the way, I love every single one of your questions, Mark, because they're the exact same questions that we've all been asking ourselves as we looked at this great organization and also post the signature, if you will, as we really started comparing kind of what we all have. And so I think it's probably too early to comment on the exact overlap of clients, things of that nature. But if you imagine and you know full well the types of clients that ADP serves on a global, call it, enterprise perspective and you imagine that they have some of the most formidable marquee clients. You can only imagine that there's overlap there. So what we're focused on is exactly what you're referring to, which is adding this offering into our global and enterprise call it, go-to-market growth opportunity. We're pretty excited and you mentioned Lyric and what you saw with WalkMe with Lyric. I hope we get to the Lyric conversation today because we're really excited about where that is on the heels of HR Tech. If you imagine marrying Lyric to the great story now of WorkForce Software, that's an exciting opportunity for us as we extend our reach into that global MNC, call it, enterprise space. So that is the intention. It is an offer that's where it sits today. I think it does add to the plethora of offerings that ADP does have across our Workforce Management Solutions. So if you imagine, we have products already in that space. We also have partnerships in that space. We have products in the mid-market. We also have partnerships there. And certainly we have time and attendance offerings also in the down market, inclusive of, I think we have well over almost 100 marketplace partners in the down-market. So this offering is going to be a great addition to our overall suite, specifically in that global enterprise space. And that is a growth story for us, and it's married directly to our Lyric excitement. And so that's the intent and we're working through each and every one of the questions you asked as we speak. Mark Marcon : Great. Look forward to hearing more on the progress. Thank you. Maria Black : Thank you, Mark. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Scott Wurtzel : Great. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to the PEO segment to start and thought the results there were very encouraging, especially on the bookings side. So I would love to hear just a little bit about that bookings outperformance. And has there been any sort of change to the sales strategy to your benefits packaging and offering a little bit of a combination of both. Any color on that would be very helpful. Maria Black : Sure. I think it's intense focus and execution. And so I think the team has been very focused. We've been speaking about this since the strangeness in the PEO post-pandemic. We've been very focused on reaccelerating bookings. And so I think it's great execution by the team. I think the offering, the value proposition, and I've been pretty bullish about this. Well, probably since about 1997. But listen, the PEO value proposition, it continues to only gain in strength. You mentioned health offerings and things of that nature that sits squarely in that space. If you are a company of the target market of our PEO in the industries that we target with our PEO offering here at ADP, you need the types of things that the PEO offers, that's best-in-class health benefits. It's a competitive workers' compensation program. It's best-in-class retirement services offerings. And so I think continuing to lean into that value proposition. And as I always say, and I said it earlier today, it's not getting any easier for those types of clients to be employers that's only getting more complex. And so I think we're aligning our sales organization to be laser-focused on it and I think it's a byproduct of strong execution. Scott Wurtzel : Got it. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up on the WorkForce Software acquisition. And as we sort of think about maybe incremental revenue opportunities. I mean is there -- I know it's an enterprise-focused solution. Is there an opportunity to maybe also bring this down to serve your mid-market customers as well? Maria Black : So again, I think that's in the same bucket as Mark's question. I think that is a big piece of what we are working through at this time. I think they have across their thousand clients, they certainly have clients in that space. I think, again, the way I sort through it, if you again go back to the big plethora, I use that word to describe the varied offerings we have across each segment, down-market, mid-market, upmarket across each one of the global businesses, the in-country offerings. In fact, we were not too long ago, actually bought a time and attendance offering in Asia-Pac. And so we have organic and we have proprietary offerings. We partner and we go to market in this giant array of offerings and how we sort through that. I think the easiest way that I think about it is client by client. And so I think we kind of put the client at the center, making sure that we are allowing the best possible solutions for our clients. And certainly, as we absorb WorkForce Software's offerings into our ecosystem of time and attendance we will be taking a close look at the mid-market clients and making sure that, call it, client by client, they have the right offering at the right time. Scott Wurtzel : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is open. Samad Samana : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions and I'll echo the congrats on a good quarter. Don, maybe first one for you. Just as I think about the size of the WorkForce deal, it's one of your bigger transactions. Any signal in that, that we should take whether that's the company willing to be more acquisitive or if multiples are in a state where ADP is maybe ramping up M&A more broadly overall or is this a one-off as part of a strategy or kind of a broader signal? And then I have a follow-up for Maria. Don McGuire : Okay. Samad, thanks for the question. Yes, in terms of absolute dollars, definitely one of the larger acquisitions or the largest acquisition ADP has ever done. Although I think the company is a lot bigger than it was when we did some of those acquisitions a number of years back. So I think it fits in squarely. I don't think our M&A be more precise than that. Our M&A strategy hasn't changed. We look for opportunities and we've been looking for opportunities for quite some time, but we need to make sure that they're additive. We need to make sure they complement our offer and they don't complicate our offer. Spent a lot of time over the last 10 years or so, cleaning up our portfolio and making sure we get fewer platforms to do the same thing. And so looking at things that are additive to us are in good tight adjacencies as this acquisition was and making sure that the business model, the recurring revenue model is particularly important to us the way we go to market, looking at all those things is important and will continue to be important to us. So we will continue to look. And if things show up that we think are going to be additive to us and we have an opportunity, we'll move again. But certainly we haven't really changed our philosophy at all on how we approach and what we're looking for in terms of M&A. Samad Samana : Great. And then, Maria, just maybe a question on Lyric. This is something that investors have talked to us a lot about. Just thinking about how it builds on Lifion, which was a focus before. And with the rebranding, I guess, the question we've gotten is, is this, what was the evolutionary or revolutionary moment that led to the rebranding now? Is it product market fit is finally right, and maybe there's an inflection that we're reaching? Is it about from a go-to-market perspective like what led to it now at this particular moment? And should we see maybe an inflection in demand going forward? Maria Black : I'm so glad you asked Samad. I've been excited to talk about Lyric for quite some time. So just to level set, just everyone's clear, Lyric is the new name for Next-Gen HCM. And I think we're all tired of saying Next Gen HCM. I think that was part of it. But all kidding aside, listen, we couldn't be more thrilled to bring ADP Lyric HCM into the market. Personally, I love the name. I think it's a name that evokes emotion. It speaks to the rhythm of what it looks like to be a worker in today's environment and making sure that's something that perhaps was static in the past that didn't have the right type of Lyrics to it ultimately comes alive with the name. And so I think it's the right name at the right time. I think to answer the why now. I think the world is ready for this next offer of HCM in this space. This product, it's flexible, it's intelligent. It's designed with humanity in mind. It's human-centric and its design is how we speak about it. And that is groundbreaking and that is orchestrated really around the person. And what that allows for things, as I mentioned earlier, such as flexible workflows. It allows for inserting Generative AI that can drive everything from anomaly detection to nudges. And so it is a unique offer and that it is married to, call it, the other strengths of ADP. It's a global HCM, global payroll and global service. That's unique and we're pretty excited. And so I think part of it is the market is ready. I think the other part is we're ready. And so as we unveil this, there's been tremendous demand from the clients. I think we saw in the heels of HR Tech. We saw great analyst reviews. Mark just mentioned seeing some of the functionality. And so I think the buzz is out there. We see that also in the pipelines. But as you can imagine, it's still early days. So it's going to take some time until it contributes to the overall ADP financials. But from a product perspective, it's the right product at the right time with the right name. We're pretty excited to lean into that growth story, marry it now to the WorkForce Software offering that we're folding in, I think, it's a great growth opportunity for ADP. Samad Samana : Thank you as always. Appreciate it. Maria Black : Thank you Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Retention continues to outperform expectations. Can you update us on the drivers here, new products, technology, maybe fewer SMB bankruptcies. I'm not sure if that's still an important driver. And also what was the retention rate in the quarter? Maria Black : Sure. So I think happy to talk about the drivers. I mentioned some of them earlier. Listen, all of the things that we're doing, best-in-class service, the investments we make into our product set, it is yielding a better experience. You see that directly on the NPS. NPS correlates to retention. So I'd like to think some of the results we have are structural. I will say that from an outperformance perspective in the first quarter, we did see, while retention was down slightly or declined slightly, we did see that the SBS or the small businesses held. And so our belief in how we're looking at the outlook for the rest of the year is that while we are almost normalized back to kind of the out of business rates from fiscal '19. We're not all the way normalized. And so we do still expect that there could be some pullback. Part of how we've also modeled it, so many of our businesses last year specifically, were at record highs on the retention. So I think we modeled kind of assuming that those businesses were at record highs, and we're assuming some pullback in the down market, specifically as it relates to out of business. Listen, we didn't see that in the first quarter. We're hoping that between the strength in small business, kind of the environment, coupled with strong execution on our strategic roadmap around best-in-class products and best-in-class service will ultimately yield continued favorability, but we believe at this time that the retention guide is prudent. Ramsey El-Assal: Great. And a follow-up for me then is on PEO margins, they came in better than expected in the quarter and you listed your full year margin expectations for the segment. Could you elaborate on the main drivers there? And also for the full year, are you anticipating any reserve releases around workers' comp. As I recall I don't think that flowed in last year at this time. So I was curious. Don McGuire : Yes. So Ramsey, firstly, the PEO margins were certainly better and really based on the struggle revenue that we had in the quarter. So stronger revenue based on stronger Worksite Employee growth and also some help from rates -- wage rates. So that was really the biggest driver for the improvement in margin in PEO. We did have a small release of $4 million in the quarter. And certainly, that contributed a little bit as well, but we are not anticipating to see releases for workers' compensation reserves as we did in prior years. So that is not something that we factored into our balance for the forecast. So strong Worksite Employees, strong growth in wage rates, strong growth in margin. Ramsey El-Assal: Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tien- Tsin Huang : Hey, thanks. You covered a lot already here. But I just want hoping Maria can elaborate on the strong pipeline comment. Any surprises or change in visibility across all of your markets, any change in decision-making, I know, we get a lot of questions up market around the elections. Can we see a little bit of a pause before we get back to normal that kind of thing. Maria Black : So the answer to your question is really no change. So we exited the fourth quarter. We talked about strong pipelines. We're exiting this quarter, feeling confident in strong pipelines. We haven't seen any changes in buying behaviors as it relates to any of the things that are happening across the world if you will. That's not to suggest that we're not keeping a watchful eye. I think we've spoken about deal cycle, specifically in the upmarket because as you mentioned, that's where a lot of the questions come in the space. And I think we're in that new normal. I think it looks like it used to back in the pre-pandemic. And so I think it's just the normal cycle. Listen, as always, every quarter has a little bit of ebb and flow as it relates to some businesses. But I think overall, the strength was broad-based exiting the fourth quarter, exiting the first quarter and the strength on the pipeline side is also broad-based. And just a reminder, pipelines look different, in the down market, it's about net new appointments. It's about activities. It's about those things in the mid-market and into the enterprise space, obviously, these are year-on-year pipeline compares and we feel solid about the pipeline. Tien- Tsin Huang : Terrific. Thanks for that. Just my quick follow-up. I know Mark and others asked about cross-sell potential synergies with WorkForce Software, but it's got some really nice logos going to the site when you first announced this. So is cross-sell an important consideration and decision to bring the asset in? Maria Black : I think and by the way, of course, those logos are also very exciting and the many logos many would be familiar with from a marquee brand perspective. I think how we go to market together is an exciting story. So some of that will be the continued way that this company has been able to execute and win really marquee clients in the marketplace. I'd like to think it only helps them to have the scale and the brand of ADP behind them. And so in a more simple way to say it, if you think about global marquee clients going out to RFPs, the exciting part is we're going to get invited to all of their parties. And hopefully we get -- they get invited to all of our parties. And I think the strength between their product and our distribution and our scale and our brand, I think, leads us to be very optimistic on the growth narrative. Tien- Tsin Huang : Yes. No, sounds like it. Thank you, Maria. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open. Caroline Latta : Hi. This is Caroline Latta on for Jason. I just had a question on Generative AI. I know you mentioned progress on rolling out some of those initiatives. Do you have any call-outs on potential further investment and cadence of that over the coming year? Don McGuire : Caroline, thanks for the question. No real. I'll start with no real call-out on further investments. We are continuing to invest modestly as we've shared over the last few quarters. And we are continuing to see good results. Maria touched on some of those earlier. Certainly, some of the call summarization tools that have been deployed already are showing good results. We've seen good results in our sales area, setting appointments, deciding which appointments to go to preparing for appointments, coaching salespeople when they're in live calls and we're continuing to see opportunities and success in our technology area, coding and some of the co-pilot tools that are available there. So really not a lot of incremental investment, really just continuing the course and looking to get more and more returns on the investments we've made over the coming quarters. Caroline Latta : Really helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Kartik Mehta : Good morning. Maria, you talked a little bit about the SMB and out of business, and you're anticipating maybe it hasn't completely normalized. But I'm wondering as you look at KPIs for your customers, what do you think about the health of small businesses? And if you've seen any change over the last few months? Maria Black : Sure. Good morning, Kartik. So, yes, listen, it's pretty close to being normalized. We're almost there. In terms of the health of small businesses overall, we look at a lot of indexes. We look at other organizations that serve similar type of, call it, nondiscretionary offerings that we serve. I think overall health of small business is strong. There are a couple of watchout items. One of the ones that we pay close attention to is new business formations. And so while it's down year-on-year and it's down even fiscal year-to-date, that is a watch out item. That said, it's still elevated. So it's elevated from where, call it, used to sit, pre-pandemic. And so it's still arguably considered strong. So on one hand, it's strong. On the other hand, it's pulled back a tiny bit from the strength that it used to have. That's just one thing. But we look at all of these things. I think the general sentiment as it relates to demand across the down market and as it relates to the small business side is it continues to be strong. I think we spoke quite a bit about the down market last year and we continue to see good execution among small businesses and overall strength. Kartik Mehta : And, Don, just a follow-up. Any thoughts on change of strategy for the portfolio? I know yields have been coming up a little bit. But I'm wondering if there's any thoughts on maybe changing some of the duration or just any other changes you might want to do for the portfolio based on kind of the yield? Don McGuire : No, Kartik, we've looked at that, and we think we've benefited significantly on our laddering that we've done over the last 20 years or so. And we did have a bit of opportunity cost, as we've shared over the last couple of years as we've been dealing with an inverted yield curve. But that yield curve is slowly starting to normalize. So we should expect to see more benefit. We also called out in our, in the prepared remarks, we are taking our investment or client fund interest number down by $10 million, but we think the net impact because borrowing is less expensive now at the short end. We do think that we're going to be flat to our initial guidance for the year. So we don't see any compelling reason to change the structure of our portfolio. Kartik Mehta : Perfect. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Your line is open. Dan Dolev : Hey, guys. Really good results here. Thank you. Just a quick housekeeping question. Would you be able to quantify how much of the EBIT drag as a result of any incremental amortization? Don McGuire : Well, I don't want to get into too much of the sausage making here, but we did disclose the value of the deal at $1.2 billion. And I think industry averages are somewhere in the neighborhood of 30%. So you can go from there and look at a seven to eight year amortization period and kind of figure it out. I'm sure all of you have done it already anyway. But rough numbers I think that would get you in the ballpark. Dan Dolev : Okay. Got it. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up. I mean, you're doing really well on the top line. Can you maybe discuss a little bit of your pricing strategies and the pricing environment for the deals? And I'm sorry if it had already been asked, I joined late. Thank you. Don McGuire : So pricing, we have had 100 to 150 basis points over the last couple of years. I think as inflation moderates somewhat, we're expecting to get closer to 100 basis points this year and that's where we're sitting. So really no changes to pricing strategy since we spoke last time. And we'll make a small color though on price. It had a small impact in our revenue for the quarter. We do have a couple of European countries where in the mid and the upmarket, the price increases are tied to various inflation indices and those indices came in higher. So we did get a little bit of contribution from price that we weren't expecting, but not a significant amount like literally in the 10 bp range for the quarter. So nothing significant. But no real change. No change for our pricing strategy. Dan Dolev : Got it. Great results again. Thank you. Maria Black : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Pete Christiansen with Citi. Your line is open. Pete Christiansen : Good morning. Thanks for the question. Nice trends this quarter. One quick one on WorkForce Software and a bit of a housekeeping on top of that. Just curious, Maria, in terms of the, I understand the strategic rationale, I totally understand. You're still working through things. But if we think about the opportunity and framing that, is it more about new logo adds from their customer set or do you see upside more a function of scaling their solutions on your existing base, just the hypothesis there on sizing the upside opportunity. Maria Black : Yes. Thanks, Pete. I think the answer to your question is both, right. But I think scaling their opportunity, leveraging a lot of ADP strength, our scale, our distribution, our brand. I also look at this, the Workforce Management Space, it's a sizable total addressable market, right. So if you look at it from a TAM perspective, the TAM sits in the billions. We serve a lot of that today. Some of those billions are obviously domestic. Some of those are in the international space. I also look at this as an area across the world that will continue to expand. And there I'm not talking about the next quarter or perhaps even the next year. When you think about the needs of global companies over the next decade, if you will, across ADP and what companies will look at as they try to solve for their global workforces and new ways and new places, I think, this is an area that is going to continue to grow in demand and having an offering that can grow and expand as that demand expands, I think, is all about the growth story of ADP both, call it, in quarter this year, but also about the future of the company. So really excited to more meaningfully step into this space. And I think that's what it's about. But certainly continuing their successful growth and our successful growth in this space. And in an ideal world, the execution here looks like that one plus one equals three, right, not two, so. Pete Christiansen : Sure, sure. That makes a lot of sense there. And then a quick housekeeping modeling question for Don. Just curious plans for the assumed debt from the transaction. And if you could potentially size the interest expense impact to earnings for us, that would be helpful. Thank you. Don McGuire : Well, I guess, I'd point you to our release. We issued $1 billion of notes earlier in the year at 4.75% and this transaction was $1.2 billion. So you can impute the interest there. I think it's yeah. Pete Christiansen : Okay. Sorry about that. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with UBS. Your line is open. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thank you. Just one on the WorkForce acquisition. Any sense as that business scales, how much revenue it can contribute versus, I guess, what the multiplier effect could potentially be off of the acquired revenues you scale it across your existing client base? Don McGuire : Good question and certainly a question that we looked at when we're putting our business case together and making the decision to pursue this company. But as I said earlier, it's a little bit early to start drawing out the expectations here. The excitement is palpable. The sales forces are able to work together. There are a lot of things you can't do until you actually have the deal signed. And so it's really been two weeks and a bit since that's happened. And I think the work teams are hard at it, trying to identify opportunities. And I think there's lots of opportunity, as Maria said earlier. We have clients, they don't have. They have clients, we don't have and there's a whole bunch of new logos out there that we can go pursue. And I think the great technology that came with WorkForce Software with ADP's financial strength behind it and more certainty perhaps in a smaller company is going to contribute to this growth here. So we're excited about it and we think there's going to be more, but a little bit early at this point to call out the numbers. Kevin McVeigh : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Zachary Gunn with FT Partners. Your line is open. Zachary Gunn : Hey, there. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to go back to Lyric for a second. I understand it's still smaller going to take a bit to have a meaningful impact. Just wondering if there's any thought process of how long it will take before it starts to have a meaningful impact to numbers? And just any data points you can give around that? I know last quarter, I think there was some commentary of client count increasing 30% year-over-year. So just any commentary there would be great. Thanks. Don McGuire : Yes. Zach, we're very excited about the live clients we have, and they continue to increase. And as Maria said, there was an awful lot of excitement coming out of HR Tech in Las Vegas. So the pipeline has increased pretty dramatically. Lots of work to do. Once again, it's going to take a little bit of time to move the needle. $20 billion of revenue. We're trying to move that needle a lot. It takes a lot. So once again give a little bit of time. And as we package up these offers, the Lyric and the WorkForce Software, along with our tax compliance and the other solutions we have, global payroll, we're expecting good things. But once again a little bit early to share specifics. Operator : Thank you. We have time for one last question and that question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. James Faucette : Thank you very much. Just had a couple of, I guess, nuanced questions. First, last quarter, you had suggested that PEO pays per control would be lower than that of Employer Services. With it downticking this quarter, do you still believe there's growth in PEO pays per control this year? Don McGuire : Yes. So the short answer is, yes, we believe there's growth in PEO pays per control this year. There was growth in the quarter, and we expect it to be continued growth, but we do expect it to be softer than the 2% at the high end that we have for Employer Services. So, yes, growth, yes, lower than Employer Services. James Faucette : Okay. Got it. I just want to make sure I understood that. And then following up and sorry if I missed this, but did you quantify Employer Services bookings growth for the quarter specifically? And it sounds like you're still pretty constructive on that front, but how you think about that for the full year range? Don McGuire : No, we did not quantify for the quarter, and we're still sticking to our 4% to 7% guidance that we established at the outset of the year. As you know, things can get lumpy. But Maria said, we had a record first quarter on bookings, new business bookings, and we're comfortable with where we landed, and we're happy with the pipelines. Demand is strong. So we're still thinking that 4% to 7% range. James Faucette : Got it. Got it. Thanks for the clarity there. And just maybe just one last question there is, what are some of the swing factors that would push you towards one end of that range either to the upside or to the lower end? Don McGuire : It's all about execution. I think that demand remains strong. Demand for HCM remains strong, demand for payroll. We don't work in a nondiscretionary industry. People need what we have and what we sell. So we do think that demand is consistent and we'll have to watch and see how things go. We've got one quarter behind us. We're happy with the quarter, solid first quarter. But I can't think of any specific things other than massive macro changes, et cetera, which none of us are anticipating. Certainly, if we look at some of the GDP numbers, we look at the inflation numbers, we look at the labor numbers, they all point to pretty solid and stable demand. So I think we're going to stick with our 4% to 7% for the time being. James Faucette : Okay, great. Appreciate all that detail. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Maria Black for closing remarks. Maria Black : Thanks, Michelle, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. I have to say it's not every day you get to get on and talk about such a solid quarter, both with respect to the overall performance of the business, but also making meaningful steps in our strategic priority agenda. So really excited about the quarter. I want to thank my team specifically. There's a lot that comes together to execute what we just did. I want to thank my team, I want to thank, obviously, the broader ADP organization, as I did earlier, really proud of the execution across the entire company. And then once again, welcome to WorkForce Software. Really excited to see where the future leads us. We're just getting started. Operator : Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",
