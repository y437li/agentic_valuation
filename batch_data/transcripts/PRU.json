Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the first quarter 2014 earnings teleconference. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Eric Durant. Please go ahead. Eric Durant : Thank you, Cynthia. Good morning. Thank you for joining us. Representing Prudential on today's call are John Strangfeld, CEO; Mark Grier, Vice Chairman; Charlie Lowrey, Head of International Businesses; Steve Pelletier, Head of Domestic Businesses; Rob Falzon, Chief Financial Officer; Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. In order to help you to understand Prudential Financial, we will make some forward-looking statements in the following presentation. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. Additional information regarding factors that could cause such a difference appears in the section titled Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures of our earnings press release for the first quarter of 2014, which can be found on our website at www.investor.prudential.com. In addition, this presentation may include references to adjusted operating income or to earnings per share or EPS or return on equity or ROE, which are determined based on adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP measure of performance of our Financial Services businesses that excludes certain items. Adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, GAAP and the excluded items are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations. For a reconciliation of adjusted operating income to the comparable GAAP measure, please see our earnings press release on our website. Additional historical information relating to the company's financial performance is also located on our website. I'll forego the repeat. On to John. John Robert Strangfeld : Thank you, Eric. Good morning, everyone, thanks for joining us. And we'd like to acknowledge also, today, we have Charlie Lowrey in a different role as Head of International and we welcome Steve Pelletier in his new role as head of the U.S. Before I hand it over Mark and Rob for more specifics, I'd like to kick things off with some macro comments. We are very pleased with the results for the first quarter and we believe we're off to a good start to achieve our goals for 2014. Our annuities, retirement and asset management businesses have benefited from sustained growth and account values of asset under management. Returns and risk profile in our annuities operation continue to migrate towards our objectives for this business, as the sustained period of favorable equity markets and a gradual shift in the composition of our block have driven improvement. We're very comfortable with the risk profile as it stands today and we're also comfortable with the expected profitability of the products that we are selling. Our Retirement business had its best ever quarter. Outstanding results were driven by improved investment spreads in both Institutional Investment Products and Full Service retirement, even excluding a higher than expected contribution from non-component investments. Higher fees also contributed to earnings growth this quarter. And although we recorded no pension risk transfer transactions this quarter, we continue to believe that PRT is an attractive opportunity that will develop further over time. Asset Management achieved its growth in earnings entirely on the strength of growth in asset management fees, reflecting growth in assets under management. Other related revenue was down slightly from a year ago and contributed less than 20% of adjusted operating income for the quarter. So as assets management earnings have increased, we believe it's quality of earnings have improved as well. In our domestic insurance operations, we see underlying improvement, even though adjusted operating income is lower than a year ago. After 6 consecutive quarters of mortality more favorable than expected, individual insurance had less favorable experience this quarter. Our integration of Hartford continues to progress well and our distribution capabilities are broader and deeper than before as a result. We believe our product portfolio, now fully integrated, is well diversified and poised to achieve appropriate returns. Lower earnings in Group Insurance reflected a less favorable result to disability, attributable to an adverse fluctuation in claims. Disability remains a work in progress and while the business has improved, its improvement will not be linear. Getting this business right will take more time, but we are confident we will get there. Finally, International Insurance, excluding the few significant items Mark will review with you, recorded modestly higher earnings with hindrance from currency translation. The Life Planner earnings continue to benefit from business growth but the benefit in that growth was partially offset by less favorable mortality and foreign currency translation. The business itself is still humming along, producing very attractive returns. Gibraltar's results reflected lower expenses, as well as modest business growth. Gibraltar has now completed the integration of Star and Edison and the expense savings we plan for are now in the till. Within Gibraltar's captive agency system, we've raised performance standards and the sales productivity of our life consultants is now in line with that of Gibraltar's agents prior to the acquisition of Star and Edison. Over time, the number of life consultants will stabilize and then grow and that will give the business a boost. So overall, we feel very good about our quarter and where we're going. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark. Mark, over to you. Mark B. Grier: Thanks, John. Good morning, good afternoon, or good evening. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll take you through our results for the quarter and then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon, who will cover our capital and liquidity picture. So starting with Slide 2, I'll begin with an overview of our financial results for the quarter. On a reported basis, common stock earnings per share amounted to $2.40 for the first quarter based on after-tax adjusted operating income of the Financial Services businesses. This compares to EPS of $2.27 a year ago. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items in both the current quarter and the year-ago quarter, EPS was up 16% amounting to $2.46 this quarter compared to $2.12. On that basis, pretax earnings for our operating divisions increased by 17% for the quarter. This is largely the result of 3 things. First, a greater contribution from investment results, reflecting exceptionally strong current quarter returns from non-coupon investments, including our Fosun venture, as well as actions we've taken to reposition the portfolios for our pension risk transfer business and Prudential retirement. Secondly, higher fees driven by growth and account values and assets under management in our annuities, retirement and asset management businesses. And third, continued growth of our International Insurance business, which also benefited from lower expenses. On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $1.2 billion for the current quarter compared to a loss of $735 million a year ago. The loss in the year-ago quarter reflected the accounting impact of foreign currency remeasurement of non-yen liabilities on the books of our Japanese insurance company driven by a weakening yen. In the current quarter, the impact from this remeasurement was less significant because the yen was relatively stable in relation to the U.S. dollar and to other non-yen currencies in which we offer insurance products in Japan. The comparison of book value per share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income or AOCI, is affected by the accounting presentation mismatch from asset liability changes, driven by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The impact of these fluctuations on non-yen liabilities of our Japanese insurance companies runs through the income statement, while the offsetting impact on the corresponding assets, which are currency-matched with the liabilities, is included in AOCI rather than in net income. After adjusting the numbers to remove the impact of this mismatch, book value per share is $61.74 at the end of the first quarter, up $1.75 from year end, after payment of a quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share. As we've told you, we also evaluate our ROE performance after adjusting for this accounting presentation mismatch, which benefited our reported ROE by reducing the denominator. After removing this benefit, along with the impact on results for market-driven and discrete items, our annualized ROE for the first quarter would be about 16%, reflecting continued solid business performance with a tailwind from non-coupon investment results. Slide 3 presents a rundown of market-driven and discrete items included in our results for the quarter. In the Annuities business, we strengthened our reserves for guaranteed minimum debt and income benefits and adjusted DAC, mainly due to a decline in interest rates from year end and resulting in a charge of $0.03 per share. In Individual Life, we absorbed integration costs of about $0.01 per share related to the Hartford Life acquisition. And in our International Insurance Life Planner business, we recorded refinements to reserves and related items, mainly in Korea, amounting to a charge of $0.02 per share. In total, the items I just mentioned had a net unfavorable impact of $0.06 per share on first quarter results. During the year-ago quarter, market-driven and discrete items produced a net benefit of $0.15 per share, mainly driven by a favorable reserve and DAC update in the Annuities business and a gain in Gibraltar Life from the sale of our remaining indirect investment in China Pacific Group. Slide 4 shows net realized gains and losses. On a GAAP basis, our net income of $1.2 billion includes the items you see here, which were essentially offsetting in the current quarter. Product-related embedded derivatives and hedging activities had a negative impact of $657 million, driven by mark-to-market on our GAAP liabilities for variable annuity living benefits, reflecting the decline in interest rates in the quarter. Going the other way, mark-to-market on derivatives, mainly related to asset liability duration management, resulted in a $275 million pretax gain, also largely driven by the decline in interest rates. General portfolio activities resulted in net pretax gains of $180 million and impairments and credit losses on investments were $37 million for the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, foreign currency remeasurement had a relatively modest impact for the quarter resulting in a pretax gain of $231 million. Moving down to our business results. I'll start with our U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management businesses shown on Slide 5. Here's a view of the results of these businesses and the adjustments we would make for market-driven and discrete items to get a view of underlying performance relative to a year ago. Slide 6 highlights Individual Annuities. After adjusting from reserve and DAC updates, which were mainly driven by a decline in interest rates in the current quarter and favorable equity market performance relative to our assumptions a year ago, Annuities results were $409 million for the quarter, an increase of $99 million from a year ago. Slide 7 presents a view of the earnings trend for the Annuities business, where the results reflected in the gold bars exclude the impact of market-driven and discrete items. Most of our earnings in the Annuities business come from base contract charges linked to daily account values. On a point-to-point basis, as you see here, account values of $155 billion at the end of the first quarter are up 9% from a year ago, mainly driven by market appreciation. However, the increase in average account values compared to the year-ago quarter was 11%, outstripping the point-to-point increase and driving growth of $71 million or 12% in policy charges and fee income. Our results have also benefited from a reduced drag from charges for benefit costs and base amortization as the rising account values have lowered the perspective costs of guaranteed death and income benefits associated with our contracts and the improvements to our gross profits have contributed to a more favorable back amortization rate. Slide 8 shows annuity sales. Our gross annuity sales for the quarter were $2.3 billion, in line with the past few quarters, but down from $4.2 billion a year ago. In late February of last year, we implemented a number of changes to our highest daily income product, including reduction of income payout rates at various age bands and elimination of the guaranteed doubling of protected withdrawal value after 12 years while leaving the writer charges unchanged. Nearly all of the sales in the year-ago quarter were of the earlier version of the product, including some level of accelerated purchases in advance of the product change. We continue to take actions to adopt our products in order to maintain appropriate return prospects and improve our risk profile. As part of this process, we've taken steps to enhance our product portfolio, allowing us to broaden the choices we can offer to retirement-focused clients and their advisers, while diversifying our risk exposure. Sales of our Prudential Defined Income, or PDI product, shown in the light blue bars, have begun to meaningfully contribute to our sales mix, accounting for about $460 million or roughly 20% of gross sales for the quarter, bringing cumulative PDI sales to over $1.2 billion. PDI directs a client's entire investment to a separate account fixed income portfolio which we manage and which provides a guaranteed lifetime income amount. This income level is scaled relative to the premium paid based on the client's age at purchase. The payout percentage grows at a contractual roll-up rate until lifetime withdrawals begin. One of the key features of PDI from a risk management and return perspective is our ability built into the product design, to change both the income payout rate and the roll-up rate for new business on a monthly basis, enabling us to keep pricing in sync with changing market conditions. We've also built this pricing flexibility into the current generation of our highest daily living benefit feature called HDI 3.0, which we introduced in February of this year. HDI 3.0 allows us to change the roll-up rate for the protected value that determines the basis for lifetime income and to change the withdrawal percentages for various age bands as often as monthly for new business. The new product also requires allocation of 10% of each purchase payment to a general account fixed bucket called a secure value account that helps provide account value stability through changing market conditions. Shown on Slide 9, the Retirement business reported record-high adjusted operating income of $364 million for the current quarter, an increase of $136 million from a year ago. Current quarter results benefited by $123 million from a greater contribution from net investment results. This includes about $80 million of returns that we would consider above our average expectations on non-coupon asset classes. The exceptionally high returns on these asset classes in the current quarter, which also benefited the results of several other businesses, were largely driven by strong performance from private equity investment funds. Net investment results and retirement also benefited by approximately $30 million from actions we've taken to reposition the portfolios supporting our pension risk transfer business. The remainder of the increase in Retirement results came mainly from higher fees driven by account value growth. Turning to Slide 10. Total retirement gross deposits and sales were $10.3 billion for the current quarter compared to $9.5 billion a year ago. Full service gross deposits and sales were $8.6 billion for the quarter, with 5 case sales of over $100 million, including a major case win of $2.6 billion. This compares to total of $5.7 billion a year ago. We are not seeing major changes in the Full Service market and attractive large case opportunities are lumpy. Full service net flows amounted to $2.6 billion for the quarter. Standalone institutional gross sales were $1.7 billion in the current quarter compared to $3.8 billion a year ago. Current quarter sales included $1.4 billion of stable value rep products, while the year-ago quarter included $3.7 billion of those products sales. Greater competition is emerging in the market for these products with an increase in the number of rep providers. Our standalone institutional business had net outflows of $1.3 billion for the quarter, including benefit payments on pension risk transfer cases and withdrawals by stable value rep clients seeking provider diversification. Total retirement net flows for the current quarter amounted to $1.3 billion and account value stood at a record high $327.8 billion at the end of the quarter, up $28 billion from a year ago. Slide 11 highlights the Asset Management business. The Asset Management business reported adjusted operating income of $193 million for the current quarter compared to $169 million a year ago. The $24 million increase in earnings was mainly driven by higher asset management fees, reflecting growth in assets under management. The segment's assets under management amounted to $891 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 6% from a year ago, reflecting market appreciation together with about $17 billion of institutional and retail net flows over the past year. On Slide 12, you see the results of our U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance businesses, showing the adjustments to Individual Life results for integration costs related to the Hartford acquisition. Slide 13 highlights Individual Life. After adjusting for integration costs, Individual Life reported earnings of $133 million for the current quarter compared to $145 million a year ago. The decrease in earnings was driven by less favorable claims experience in the current quarter. The contribution, the current quarter results for mortality experience, together with reserve updates, was about $20 million less favorable than our average expectations. This compares to a mortality contribution about $15 million more favorable than our average expectations in the year-ago quarter. The impact of less favorable claims experience in the current quarter was partly offset by a greater contribution from net investment results, including about $15 million of returns that we would consider above our average expectation on non-coupon asset classes. Turning to Slide 14. Individual Life sales based on annualized new business premiums, amounted to $122 million for the current quarter. This compares to total sales of $216 million a year ago. The decrease was mainly driven by an $88 million decline in sales of guaranteed universal life insurance products shown in the dark blue bars. We've taken actions over the past year to limit concentration in these products and to maintain appropriate returns, including a series of price increases. In addition, we discontinued substantially all sales of the legacy Hartford products at the beginning of this year as we introduced our integrated Individual Life product portfolio, representing a major milestone in the business integration, which remains well on track. As we expected, these changes caused some acceleration of sales of the legacy products in the second half of last year. Term insurance sales in the light blue bars were down $8 million from a year ago, reflecting price reductions by several competitors. Sales of universal life without secondary guarantees, shown in the gold bars, contributed $25 million or about 20% of our overall sales for the current quarter. These products, which offer relatively low protection costs and are more investment growth oriented than secondary guarantee universal life, have been popular among clients and the distributers who came to us with the Hartford acquisition. We've incorporated the best features of the Hartford product and the Prudential founders plus product included in our integrated product portfolio, allowing us to broaden the choices we can offer to life insurance customers while diversifying our risks. Shown on Slide 15, Group Insurance earnings amounted to $6 million in the current quarter compared to $9 million a year ago. The unfavorable impact on results of an adverse fluctuation in Group Disability claims experience and higher expenses at a year ago was largely offset by a greater contribution from net investment results, including about $15 million of current quarter returns that we would consider above our average expectations on non-coupon asset classes. Slide 16 shows Group Insurance sales trends. Most of our group insurance sales are recorded in the first quarter based on calendar year effective dates. Group insurance sales, based on annualized new business premiums, amounted to $170 million in the current quarter, down from $193 million a year ago. The sales decline reflects our focus on restoring appropriate returns in this business. Turning to the International Insurance division on Slide 17. Here are the results of our International Insurance business. Adjusting for the current quarter refinements of reserves and related items in the Life Planner business and for the China Pacific gain and Star/Edison integration costs in Gibraltar Life a year ago. Slide 18 highlights the Life Planner operations. After adjusting for the charges I mentioned, our Life Planner business reported earnings of $435 million for the quarter, up $13 million from a year ago. Results continue to benefit from sustained business growth. On a constant dollar basis, insurance revenues, including premiums, policy charges and fees, were up 6% from a year ago. The benefit from business growth was partly offset by less favorable claims experienced, including reserves update in comparison to a strong year-ago quarter. We estimate that the negative impact on the comparison and results was about $15 million. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates, which reflect our hedging of yen income at JPY 82 this year versus JPY 80 last year, had a negative impact of $6 million on earnings in comparison to a year ago. Slide 19 highlights Gibraltar Life. Gibraltar Life reported earnings of $418 million for the current quarter, up $26 million from a year ago after adjusting for the items I mentioned. The current quarter benefited from business growth and from lower expenses than a year ago, including some nonlinear items such as employee benefit costs. Both the current quarter and the year-ago quarter benefited from strong investment results, with income from non-coupon asset classes contributing about $50 million to results in each period. Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact of $9 million in the comparison of Gibraltar's results to a year ago. Slide 20 shows the International Insurance sales trend. International Insurance sales on a constant dollar basis were $772 million for the current quarter compared to $841 million a year ago. Market developments, along with repricings and other actions taken by us and by our competitors, have produced volatility on our quarterly sales results. The impact of these factors over the past 2 years has been especially dramatic and distorts quarter-over-quarter comparison. Over that period, our international sales pattern has been affected by changes in the Japanese tax code resulting in a surge of business market sales for our cancer whole life product in early 2012; by repricing of our U.S. dollar products in mid-2012, along with weakening of the yen in relation to the U.S. dollar since then, which made our U.S. dollar products more expensive in yen terms to Japanese consumers; by product repricings by us and our competitors in reaction to changes in Japanese statutory reserve interest rates effective of April 2013, which accelerated sales of some of our products into the early part of last year; and also by opportunistic sales of over $1 billion of a yen-based single premium bank channel product at Gibraltar, followed by the discontinuation of that product late last year as we increased emphasis on recurring premium death protection products. The comparison of overall first quarter international sales to a year ago was most significantly affected by the discontinued single premium bank channel products and going back 2 years ago, by that product along with cancer whole life. If you adjust first quarter sales to exclude cancer whole life, shown in the light blue bars and the discontinued product, shown in the brown bars, current quarter sales are up 5% from a year ago and increased at a compound growth rate at 6% from 2 years ago. Slide 21 shows Life Planner sales. Life Planner sales were $369 million in the current quarter compared to $365 million a year ago. Life Planner sales are typically strongest in the first quarter which is the end of the Japanese fiscal year, driving sales of some products that are popular in the business market and March is the end -- is the close of the sales conference qualification period at Prudential of Japan. Sales in Japan for the current quarter amounted to $270 million, down slightly from a year ago. The comparison of current quarter sales to a year ago is affected by purchases in advance of a repricing of a number of our Japanese yen-based products in April of last year and by the weakening of the Japanese yen over the past year, which makes our U.S. dollar products more expensive in yen terms to Japanese consumers. Sales outside of Japan were up by $8 million or 9% from a year ago. Looking back over 2 years, the comparison of first quarter sales is most significantly affected by sales of our cancer whole life product in advance of a 2012 tax law change in Japan that made the product less attractive in the business market and by accelerated purchases of our U.S. dollar products in advance of a June 2012 repricing at Prudential of Japan. Slide 22 presents the Gibraltar Life sales trend. Sales from Gibraltar Life were $403 million in the current quarter compared to $476 million a year ago. Taking a look at Gibraltar's sales by distribution channel, you can see a $63 million decline in first quarter sales through the bank channel, shown in the gold bars, compared to a year ago when the discontinued single premium product that I mentioned contributed sales of $107 million. Sales of other products through the bank channel increased by $44 million from a year ago, driven by the recurring premium death protection products that we are emphasizing. Sales through independent agents, shown in the light blue bars, are up by $20 million from a year ago, mainly driven by retirement and investment focused products in the business market. Sales by life consultants in the dark blue bars are down $30 million from the year-ago quarter. Similar to Japanese Life Planner sales, the comparison is affected by accelerated purchases of a number of our Japanese yen-based products in advance of our repricing in April of last year. In addition, our Life Consultant count has declined by about 1,450 or 14% from a year ago as we implemented minimum production requirements and other Prudential standards for the sales force that came to us with the Star and Edison acquisition. Looking back 2 years, the comparison of first quarter sales is most significantly affected by the discontinued single premium bank channel products and by our active management of the sales force. Current quarter Life Consultant sales are at roughly the same level as 2 years ago, but with about 30% fewer agents now onboard as we've taken steps to build a more cost effective and productive proprietary distribution channel. On Slide 23, Corporate and Other operations reported a loss of $342 million for the current quarter. This compares to a $303 million loss a year ago after adjusting for a write-off of bond issue costs. The increase in the loss reflects higher expenses in the current quarter, including nonlinear items such as corporate advertising and a lower pension credit. The benefit of lower interest expense reflecting our refinancing of high coupon debt last year was a partial offset. And now I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon. Robert Michael Falzon : Thanks, Mark. I'll provide an update on some key items under the heading of financial strength and flexibility with just a few slides. Starting on Slide 24. We continue to manage our insurance companies to levels of capital that we believe are consistent with AA standards. As of year end, Prudential Insurance reported an RBC ratio of 456%, with total adjusted capital, or TAC, of $13.9 billion. While we don't perform a quarterly bottoms up RBC calculation, we estimate that our RBC ratio as of the end of the first quarter has not changed materially since year end and is above our 400% target, which we believe gives us a cushion against our AA objective. In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margins of 772% and 937%, respectively, as of their most recent reporting date, which is December 31, 2013. These are comfortably above their 600% to 700% targets. Our Japanese insurance companies will soon report solvency margins as of their March 31 fiscal year end. And while the calculations are not yet final, we expect them to continue to be in a strong position relative to their targets. Looking now at the overall capital position for the Financial Services businesses on Slide 25. We calculate our on-balance sheet capital capacity by comparing the statutory capital position of Prudential Insurance to our 400% RBC ratio target and then add capital capacity held at the parent company and at other subsidiaries. As of year end, we estimated that our on balance sheet capital capacity was about $3.5 billion, including about $1.5 billion that we consider readily deployable. Taking into account our results for the quarter, our quarterly common stock dividend of $0.53 a share or about $250 million and share repurchases also of about $250 million, we estimate our on balance sheet capital capacity was over $4 billion at the end of the first quarter. A portion of that we consider to be readily deployable has not changed materially since year end. Turning to the cash position of the parent company. Cash and short-term investments net of outstanding commercial paper amounted to $3.2 billion as of the end of the first quarter. The cash in excess of our targeted $1.3 billion liquidity cushion is available to repay maturing debt, to fund operating needs and to redeploy over time. Now I'll turn it back over to John. John Robert Strangfeld : Great. Thank you, Rob. Thank you, Mark. And with that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs. Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : A question for Mark. Met on their call last week talked about regulators getting a better understanding of separate accounts and that really regardless of what happens with the Collins Amendment, it's possible for them to either not assess capital charges or at least not assess significant capital charges for the nonguaranteed portion of separate accounts. So wondering if that's the message or sense that you guys are getting as well. Mark B. Grier: Yes, it is. And I think I'd make an even broader statement about the insight that regulators are gaining into the whole solvency model and capital world of insurance. The issue around nonguaranteed separate accounts is specific and relates to the line of sight to the capital of the company, and I think that point, as well as others, are being discussed constructively and often. Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then a question for John. You've talked about the 13% to 14% ROE target is sort of, I believe, sort of a through-the-cycle return, so there will be periods where you're clearly above that, as we've seen more recently in periods that are below. But how should we think about -- what's a reasonable sort of standard deviation from this average? John Robert Strangfeld : Well, I guess the way I look at it, Chris, is it's less about an average and more about something we think we can achieve through the cycle absent a tail event. So maybe just to put in a little more context, we've talked about this '13 and '14 aspiration since 2010. Obviously, it's no longer a goal, it's reality. And in fact, our run rate in '13, and again in Q1 of '14, is better than that. And we think this is something -- we don't think of it as an average, we'd rather think it was something we think we can achieve through the cycle absent, as I say, tail-type events. And by maintaining that through the cycle represents superior performance relative to peers and relative, I think, to most balance-sheet-oriented financial institution. So we're sticking with the '13, '14. We think its superior, it's not a once-and-done phenomena, it's a focus on sustainability over time. And that's how we're thinking about it. Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then you had some leadership changes take place post Ed's departure earlier in April. Just wondering if there's anything we should take from that in terms of potential changes in strategy or if Charlie or Steve if they've kind of assessed their businesses, if there's any incremental changes? John Robert Strangfeld : Well, I'll just offer 1 or 2 macro comments on this. This is very classic Pru of carefully thought through, orderly change, planned over a long period of time. So you've seen nothing in this transition that's reflective of anything other than the intense focus that we always apply to talent management and to success in planning. And we're feeling very, very good about these transitions. Clearly, any new leader in a role takes a fresh look at things and that's the way to think about it. But we're feeling very good about where we are and where we're headed in the I think quality, continuity and stability in the leadership team. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Dally with Morgan Stanley. Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : First question on Gibraltar. You've done a great job of improving the consultant productivity. So are they still seeing those relatively large declines in the number of consultants down another 5%, 6% on a sequential basis? I know you mentioned in your comments that you expect that number to eventually stabilize and then grow. Hoping we can get some color on when that's likely to happen. Charles Frederick Lowrey : Sure, Nigel. This is Charlie. So let's just -- let me take that in a couple of different ways. So the Life Consultant account was down about 14% year-over-year. And that really does reflect, as you said, a continuation of the active management of the Star and Edison sales force, enforcing validation requirements and doing a variety of other things. But a couple of comments on that : The second derivative of the decrease is derivating, in other words, is decreasing. In other words, the rate of decrease is decreasing. So this quarter, we went down by 14%. Last quarter, we went down by 18% and the quarter before that, we went down by 20%. So it is coming down. Now in terms of productivity, we're back up to where we were before we acquired Star and Edison. So we're back up at sort of 3.5 policies per month level. So productivity is where it was. And so I think what you'll see going forward, what you'd expect is the percent change in sales will reflect now the percent change in the Life Consultant account going forward. And that's exactly what we see is happening and that's exactly what happened with TOA. So if we go back about a decade to TOA, TOA took 4 years to actively manage their sales force to where wanted it to be. And the sales force was reduced over that period of time by roughly 40%, rough justice. Now we're 3 years into the Star/Edison process and we're down rough justice, about 30%. So we have a ways to go. We're entering into the bottoming-out phase. But I think you'll probably see that later this year or the beginning of next year, somewhere in that time frame, as we finalize the process. But this is a sort of textbook -- sort of what we did with TOA and we're doing exactly the same thing here. Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Great. That's helpful. Second question on group insurance, being that the repricing tools several years but results don't seem to be getting better. Is perhaps the price increases that you've been pushing through have been insufficient and that you need another round of rate hike beyond your original expectations or is it more just a matter of timing that the actions that you take are just going to take more time to be evident in the results? Steve Pelletier : Nigel, this is Steve Pelletier. The results in group insurance this quarter are driven purely in the disability business and purely through claim severity in the disability business. When we look at what we've done over the past couple of years and are continuing to do in the business in terms of repricing, in terms of lapsation of unprofitable business, in terms of claims incidents, and in terms of effectiveness of managing claims, we don't see any reason to lack confidence in the path of recovery that the business is on. Having said that, as Charlie has emphasized in the past, that path is not going to be a linear one. It can have ups and downs as we saw this quarter in relation to claim severity. But we think that the price increases we've engineered in the past couple of years and that we continue to increase are at the appropriate level. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : So first, a question on the stable value business. Your sales flows slowed down there. And you mentioned a little bit, you're seeing a little bit more competition. So just if you could elaborate on that and whether you're seeing competition from public companies, mutuals? And then secondly, on FSA, very strong flows during the large case, I think, about $2.6 billion in there. But maybe talk about competitive trends in that market as well and what your view is in terms of pricing conditions in the Full Service market. Steve Pelletier : Jimmy, Steve again. I will take your questions in kind of reverse order, the points you mentioned. First of all, Full Service. No, we don't see any change in our view of competitive dynamics in the marketplace or in our business strategy in relation to those dynamics. We're obviously pleased by the first quarter sales and flows. However, I'd emphasize that, that contained one very large case, a $2.6 billion case, a public entity on the West Coast. We said before that we're selective in relation to these large cases. Selective does not mean we can't compete, though, when we like the characteristics of the case as we did in this instance. But I don't think that's anything that we can count on going forward. As Mark said, they are inherently lumpy. In IOSD, you are seeing a slowing of sales, and that's fully expected on our part. Our sales performance the last few years in the business reflected our stepping into a void in the marketplace. And now the competitive circumstances are changing. Having grown the book the way we did, we are now facing concentration limits at some counterparties as we would expect to. Also, as you mentioned, new competition, that is coming, Jimmy, both from banks and insurance companies. So I'd emphasize that there's a range of new competitors in that market. As of right now, we have not seen the entrance of that new competition and new capacity depress margins in the market. But obviously, we've got our eyes closely on that. We're not -- it would stand to reason that increased competition could do that, as we've done so to date, but we got our eyes on it. Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : And then maybe one more on the Individual Life business. Hartford had showed a decent amount of universal life with secondary guarantees. You obviously pulled their product off the shelf and you've incorporated some of the features of their product into yours. How comfortable -- as you looked at the Hartford block more, how comfortable are you with the pricing in that -- in the block that you acquired? Steve Pelletier : We feel solid about the block of business in terms of its profitability, in terms of its risk profile. The pulling of the product, of the Hartford product from the shelf, is simply reflective of our integrated product design strategy and it just reflects further integration progress following the acquisition. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : One quick follow-up on the Group business. The -- so just looking at the earnings trajectory and so the loss ratio on Group Disability, do you need to take another round of rate and repricing for that group disability block? Steve Pelletier : We continue to repress the business as it comes up for repricing, Tom. So that's not a course of activity that ends. We are about 60% of the way through repricing the block of business that was on the books a few years year ago. We expect to make significant further progress regarding the remainder at the beginning of next year. Most of this business reprices at January 1 of the year and then the remainder would occur during the course of 2015. So this is not a process we're done with but it's a process that has been progressing as expected. Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. And then one for Mark. The -- any thoughts on the dual bills that are running through the house and the senate, focused on the Collins Amendment and whether that's significant from your end? Mark B. Grier: Well, there's certainly a qualitative significance in the broad-based support for clarifying the original Collins Amendment as it relates to capital standards for non-bank SIFIs. And I think there's a compelling message in the fact that a number of legislators on both sides of the aisle and in both houses of Congress have stepped up to endorse or co-sponsor these bills. I'm not going to comment on the prospects for passing the bills because that's deeper water that I'm willing to swim in. I'm not quite sure how all that stuff is going to work. But I think there's a very clear message in the formulation and the positioning of these bills in both parties and in both houses. Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : And, Mark, just a follow-up on that. Is it important from your end that this does get passed and clarified in terms of the ultimate rule setting? Or do you believe that it -- even without these getting past that, ultimately, it's going to get to a place that you all would be comfortable with? Mark B. Grier: I do believe that this will ultimately get to a place that we'll be comfortable with. The Collins Amendment, as originally drafted or passed and as interpreted by some, is actually an obstacle to implementing Dodd-Frank and achieving the objectives of the bill relative to stability and financial strength. And I think that's clear, and I think we will, ultimately, find a solution either through this kind of legislation or through a more direct administrative solution. Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. And then just one follow-up on retirement. The margins there were quite strong even after stripping out what you've defined as favorable investment income. Can you describe what's really driving it? I saw crediting rest rates were down by a fair amount, is it really just spreads? Steve Pelletier : Spreads are a contribution to it, but also, I mean, I think you're seeing when you take a look at, for example, the Full Service part of the business, you look at our ability to generate greater contributions through a lot of the work we've done in that part of the business. Greater implementation of auto enrollment activities, auto escalation features in plans. So that has helped as well. In the meantime, withdrawals stay at a relatively consistent percentage of unplanned balances. So that has also been a contributor. Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : So just operating leverage in the business continues to flow through, is that a fair description? Steve Pelletier : I think that would be a good characterization of it, yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with UBS. Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Just a question to start on annuities and the ROA. If I look at Slide 7 of your deck, it looks like the year-over-year improvement in ROAs was pretty significant, from 87 basis points to I guess 105. And I know on the last call, we talked about some of the dynamics or drivers that are causing this to occur. But I just want to get a sense, order of magnitude. How much of that improvement would you say is related to the whole K factor adjustments that you make on a quarterly basis? Steve Pelletier : I'd say a very significant portion of this today. This is Steve. When you look at the scale of economies in the business, those remain in place, the business has effectively managed expenses from a general administrative standpoint. But the lowering of the K factor has been significantly driven by outsized equity market performance of certainly the past year, but over the past few years. As you all know, our projections for equity market group are more modest. And so then it would only stand to reason that if markets performed in line with those expectations, any further expansion of the ROA would be at a much more modest rate. Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Got it. And then I guess -- I don't know if we can do this externally, but if you wanted to look at this annuity ROA maybe on a statutory basis, where I'm guessing that we would eliminate a lot of the noise around DAC and K factors. What would that improvement sort of look like, order of magnitude? Steve Pelletier : We won't be able to address that today, Suneet. I haven't even looked at that. We report annuity results on a GAAP basis and we've got multiple legal entities here. It would be difficult to do in a way that would be very meaningful. Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. That's fair. And I guess my second question is on unbaked civvies. As we think about some of the commentary we've heard from AIG and MetLife, it sounds like both companies are spending a fair amount of time, both in terms of investments of dollars and investments of people, in terms of improving their financial systems, to be able to give the Fed what it wants in the manner in which it wants it and the time in which it wants it. And I guess we've not really heard or at least have not heard the same sort of commentary from Prudential. And I'm just kind of curious how you think your systems and everything are positioned to kind of handle what could be some sort of new stress tests if this whole non-bank civvy thing goes in a way that's similar to what -- to the direction it's been going in. Mark B. Grier: Yes, this is Mark, I'll start off and then I'll ask Rob to comment as well. I guess the beginning, starting point is that we're going through a lot of the same thing. The supervisory environment is evolving with the Federal Reserve and we're working on the same kinds of questions about reporting and interfaces and the capabilities that we need to be effectively supervised by the feds. So it's work in process for us. Let me comment briefly on stress test. We've shared with you our capital protection plan. And we go around the track on stress testing frequently here, that there will be challenges to align exactly what we do, what exactly what's expected. But we feel like that's an area in which we've refined our capabilities going back really to the beginning of the financial crisis in ways that are pretty constructive and helpful. The point of that isn't that we won't have to do some things differently but that we're coming into this with a lot of work already done around the things that we understand and also around the quality and credibility of the work we do in stress testing. The things that we understand as they affect our capital insolvency issues. Let me ask Rob to comment briefly and maybe a little more specifically on the capability issue and what's going on there. Robert Michael Falzon : Suneet, I'd make a couple of observations. One, yes, we are going to make similar investments and are making similar investments in both talent and systems. I would observe that we're starting with a very strong foundation in each deliver off of. And so that's extraordinarily helpful. Second, as Mark mentioned, from a stress testing specifically standpoint, we have done stress testing over a long period of time. We've done that both within a statutory framework and we've done that in the context of our capital protection framework as well. For us, it's a matter of migrating that over to a framework that is more Fed-centric than that which we've used. And we expect that, that will occur over an extended period of time. We are confident that we both can execute on this and that we have an ability to meet any reasonable standards that may be put up with respect to both the process of testing and the results of that testing. Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : And should we think about that migration to Fed standards as sort of a -- from a statutory framework to more of a GAAP framework? Robert Michael Falzon : I think that is absolutely one component of it. If you look at how we historically have been regulated, obviously, the statutory framework is critical to us. Although we have translated that historically into GAAP. But yes, the Fed is a GAAP regulator not a stat regulator and that would be one component of the migration. Mark B. Grier: Yes. Just one comment on that. The standard language of the regulation of -- internationally, the regulation of large financial institutions, is in a consolidated framework. And the only place for us that consolidated numbers live is in the GAAP world. We don't have a consolidated statutory view. But I would emphasize that we also have to pay a lot of attention to what our specific individual legal entities look like and the bottoms-up issues related to capital and liquidity and stress. So we're going to have to bring together both dimensions. But as Rob said, the consolidated GAAP world is generally the starting point for looking at large financial institutions in any regulatory setting, as it's been historically and as standards have emerged now. Robert Michael Falzon : I think I'll add one more comment, Suneet, which is when I described that migration, I would say that migration is coming from both sides. The existing stress testing framework that the Fed has used is very bank-centric. So it's not only GAAP, it's bank-centric. And so there's an acknowledgment that we need to move off something that's historically been entity level and statutory. And the Fed will need to look -- migrate its own stress testing away from those things that are appropriate to banks to those that are more appropriate to the insurance industry. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Erik Bass with Citi. Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : I guess could you first provide an update on your outlook for pension closeout activity. I know, John, you mention that in your opening remarks. And I guess is there a sticking point that's preventing larger deals from getting done right now or is it just a function of the long tail transaction process? John Robert Strangfeld : Sure, sure. Let me ask Steve Pelletier to speak to that. Steve? Steve Pelletier : Thanks, John. Erik, we still feel very positive about the prospects for development of the pension risk transfer markets. Funding levels are up, so are TBGC premiums. And revise mortality tables continue to sharpen every one's attention on longevity risk. So we continue to feel that, that bodes well for both the ability and propensity of planned sponsors to transact. These things take time to work their way through the system, both within plan sponsors and then on discussion with potential counterparties, like ourselves. But we still feel the basis for development is there. Charlie, last quarter talked about segmentation of the market from a size standpoint. I would add to that segmentation in the market from both a funded basis in which we're actually taking on the assets and on the part of the market where we're talking about pure longevity reinsurance. Look that in either way, both by size or by type of business, we are in a number of active discussions. We continue to feel that we will participate in the various segments of that market, in particular in the large segment that really plays to our strengths and our ability to develop customized solutions. But these transactions, as well as large full-service cases, these transactions are inherently lumpy and we'll see how they emerge. But the prospects for development of the market are still solid. Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Got it. And if I could ask just one follow-up on the annuities business, where you've highlighted again how the earnings has outpaced AUM growth. I'm just wondered how much operating leverage do you have left in this business and can earnings growth continue to exceed AUM? Again, assuming there that the markets follow your normal assumptions, not the outsized returns we've had over the past couple of years. Steve Pelletier : I think, Eric, just to echo earlier comments, there can be further progress from the operating leverage that's kind of inherent in the business but that progress is going to be much more moderate if markets perform more in line with our more moderate expectations. Operator : And we have time for one final question and that will be from the line of Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank. Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : If we look at the FX drag rate for this quarter, can you help us think about the forward impact of what with the rolling Japanese yen hedge program looks like for the next couple of years? John Robert Strangfeld : Well, we don't disclose the forward rates beyond the current year. We will talk about next year's translation rate at some point before the end of this year. But just a reminder of that, the hedging program is rigorous and structured. It's not discretionary, we don't try to anticipate moves in exchange rates, we put in place a rolling hedge over 3 years. What that basically means is that at any point in time, the next 12 months are fully hedged, the 12 months after that are about 2/3 of the way hedged and the 12 months after that are about 1/3 of the way hedged. The hedging transactions are executed in forward markets. So you ought to pay attention to the difference between spot and forward if you really want to try to hone in on this number. But basically, if rates stabilize where they are after 3 years, it will have fully worked its way through our translation and we'll be translating at a yen rate that's where the current market is. So a long way of saying it depends on how the market moves, but we do smooth it out as a result of our hedging translations. Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And to follow-up on that. As -- since you discontinued the yen-based bank channel single premium whole life product, is it fair to assume that the overall portion of U.S. dollar earnings would actually increase in Japan? And can you give us a sense of what the business mix, kind of denomination look like? Charles Frederick Lowrey : We can't give you a specific mix, but there has been a proportion of obviously dollar-based sales. That's been the best-selling products in POJ for quite some time. With the diminution in the bank products, the single premium yen denominated whole life, the interesting part is that we are beginning to sell other products, as Mark said, in that particular channel. So the recurring premium whole life has come in, as we are selling more of now. And that's right down the center of the fairway of what we want to sell. So it's much more mortality-based and we like that product. In terms of the multicurrency product, we're not selling as much in the dollar-based product for a couple of reasons : one, interest rates have come down; and two, yen has depreciated against the dollar. So that product has diminished slightly against some of the other currency products that we sell. John Robert Strangfeld : Keep in mind that the in-force is large. And so the impact of any particular product activities in any particular year isn't going to move the needle very much. Those yen-denominated single premium products, which had fairly thin margins anyway, didn't swing earnings very much in favor of yen. And any particular year's activities will have a modest impact on mix. Eric Durant : Yaron, it's Eric. Without addressing what changes might occur in the future, rough justice, today, about half of the earnings in Japan are yen-denominated. Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And then one more question on the annuity space. So clearly, you're successful in growing the PDI product, which is an income-oriented product. I think one of your competitors was talking last week about maybe shifting into a more of an investment-oriented product. Do you see a more attractive opportunity in the income protection side, or do you see some opportunities in investment growth, as well, in the annuities? John Robert Strangfeld : First of all, just to address one fact point in your question. We did launch an investment-only product at the end of April. But now let me place that in context. Our strategy in the annuities business is based on helping clients achieve secure retirement income. And doing so through a range of products that diversifies and mitigates our risk, we feel very confident about the profitability and risk profile of all the products that currently populate that strategy. HDI, as we've redesigned it, as Mark spoke about; PDI, which you mentioned; and now going forward, the investment-only product as well. So we think the range of these products is important to fulfilling that strategy of helping achieve secure retirement income.

Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the second quarter 2014 earnings teleconference. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's teleconference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Eric Durant. Please go ahead. Eric Durant : Thank you, Cynthia. Thank you for joining our call. We hope we're not interrupting your summer vacation. Representing Prudential today are John Strangfeld, CEO; Mark Grier, Vice Chairman; Rob Falzon, Chief Financial Officer; Charlie Lowrey, Head of International Businesses; Steve Pelletier, Head of Domestic Businesses; and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. In order to help you to understand Prudential Financial, we will make some forward-looking statements in the following presentation. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. Additional information regarding factors that could cause such a difference appears in the section titled Forward-looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures of our earnings press release for the second quarter of 2014, which can be found on our website at www.investor.prudential.com. In addition, this presentation may include references to adjusted operating income or to earnings per share, or EPS; or return on equity, or ROE; which are determined based on adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP measure of performance of our Financial Services businesses that exclude certain items. Adjusted operating income is not a substitute for an income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, GAAP, and the excluded items are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations. For a reconciliation of adjusted operating income to the comparable GAAP measure, please see our earnings press release on our website. Additional historical information related to the company's financial performance is also located on our website. Over to you, John. John Robert Strangfeld : Thank you, Eric. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. The central message today is that we had strong results in the second quarter, and we are on pace to achieve our goals for the year. While we've clearly benefited from some tailwinds, including strong investment results and favorable mortality, business fundamentals are the main driver of our improving results. We think it's significant that each of our divisions produced higher earnings than a year ago. Mark and Rob will review the quarter in greater detail in a few minutes, but here are a few highlights. Our Asset Management business achieved its 27th consecutive quarter of positive institutional flows. Also, retail flows were positive. Sustained growth in assets under management is driving growth in asset management fees and in operating income. Our Annuities business has benefited from a sustained period of favorable equity markets, which has driven higher earnings, improved returns and a lower risk profile. We are very comfortable with the expected profitability, as well as the risks of the products we are selling today. Over time, we expect the risk profile of this business to improve as the composition of our block gradually shifts to products with less equity market exposure. Retirement continued to produce outstanding results, largely because of strong investment spreads, including a contribution from non-coupon investments that was modestly higher than our average expectation. Although we recorded no pension risk transfer transactions in the second quarter, we completed 3 PRT deals in July, including a landmark longevity reinsurance transaction, which will hit our books in the third quarter. We continue to believe that PRT, both funded transactions like GM and Verizon, as well as those where we solely reinsure longevity risk, is an attractive business opportunity for Prudential. Individual Life Insurance and Group Insurance both achieved higher adjusted operating income this quarter. In Individual Life, the Hartford integration continues on track, and expense synergies contributed to the positive earnings result this quarter. In Group Insurance, experience was more favorable than a year ago in both life and disability. We are confident that Group Insurance is on the right track, but improvement will not be linear. Finally, International Insurance recorded solid results in the face of difficult sales comparisons and currency headwinds. Life Planner results benefited from sustained business growth and improved claims experience. Gibraltar's earnings topped $500 million for the first time, modestly above the strong result a year ago and a seasonally strong second quarter. Productivity in the Life Consultant channel is back to pre-acquisition levels, and the rate of decline in agents is slowing. And over time, we expect the number of life consultants to stabilize and then to grow, and that will give the business a further boost. So overall, we feel very good about our quarter and our business trends. And with that, Mark, over to you. Mark B. Grier: Thank you, John, and thank you, Eric. Good morning, good afternoon or good evening. And thank you, all, for joining our earnings call today. I'll take you through our results for the quarter. And then, I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon, who will cover our capital and liquidity picture. Using Slide 2, I'll start with an overview of our financial results for the quarter. On a reported basis, common stock earnings per share amounted to $2.49 for the second quarter based on after-tax adjusted operating income of the Financial Services businesses. This compares to EPS of $2.30 a year ago. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items in both the current quarter and the year-ago quarter, EPS was up by 12%, amounting to $2.51 compared to $2.24 a year ago. This is largely the result of 4 things : first, higher fees, mainly driven by growth in account values and assets under management in our Annuities and Asset Management businesses; second, improved claims experience in our Group Insurance business; third, continued growth of our International Insurance business; and fourth, lower net expenses in several of our businesses. On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of just over $1 billion for the current quarter compared to a loss of $517 million a year ago. The loss in the year-ago quarter reflected the accounting impact of foreign currency remeasurement of non-yen liabilities on the books of our Japanese insurance companies, which was driven by weakening of the yen, as well as negative mark to market on derivatives we use in duration management driven by rising interest rates. In the current quarter, the yen was relatively stable in relation to the U.S. dollar and other currencies in which we offer insurance products in Japan, and the impact of interest rate changes on our duration management derivatives was more moderate. As a result, our current quarter GAAP net income is fairly consistent with our after-tax adjusted operating income. We consider the foreign currency remeasurement that affects our net income to be essentially an accounting presentation mismatch because we hold currency-matched assets to support the non-yen liabilities of our Japanese insurance companies. And the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on the liabilities runs through the income statement, while the offsetting impact on the assets is included in accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI. Book value per share, excluding AOCI and after adjusting the numbers to remove the impact of this mismatch, amounted to $63.67 at the end of the second quarter, up by $3.68 from year-end after the payment of 2 quarterly dividends totaling $1.06 per share. We also evaluate our ROE performance after adjusting for this accounting presentation mismatch, which benefited our reported ROE by reducing the denominator. After removing this benefit, along with the impact on results from market-driven and discrete items, our annualized return on equity for the first half of the year would be about 16%. This reflects solid underlying performance across our businesses, with a tailwind from strong non-coupon investment results, particularly in the first quarter, and some seasonality that favors the first half in International Insurance. On Slide 3, we have a very short list of market-driven and discrete items included in our results for the current quarter, with a net unfavorable impact of $0.02 per share. In the Annuities business, the impact of a decline in interest rates in the quarter exceeded the benefit of favorable performance of equities and our market-driven adjustments. We strengthened our reserves for guaranteed minimum debt and income benefits and adjusted DAC, resulting in a net charge of about $0.01 per share. And in Individual Life, we absorbed integration costs of about $0.01 per share related to the Hartford Life acquisition. During the year-ago quarter, market-driven and discrete items produced a net benefit of $0.06 per share, mainly driven by a favorable reserve and DAC update in the Annuities business. Turning to Slide 4. On a GAAP basis, our net income of just over $1 billion in the current quarter includes amounts characterized as realized investment losses of $273 million pretax, comprised of the items that you see on this slide. Product-related embedded derivatives and hedging activities had a negative impact of $365 million, driven by a mark-to-market on our GAAP liabilities for variable annuity living benefits, reflecting the decline in interest rates in the quarter. Foreign currency remeasurement resulted in a pretax loss of $231 million for the current quarter. This reverses a gain of the same amount that we had in the first quarter. Impairments and credit losses on investments were $27 million for the quarter. Going the other way, general portfolio activities, mainly in our International Insurance operations, resulted in next -- net pretax gains of $199 million. And mark-to-market on derivatives, mainly related to asset and liability duration management, resulted in a $151 million pretax gain, also largely driven by the decline in interest rates. Moving now to our business results and starting on Slide 5. Slide 5 shows our U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management businesses. This is a view of the results of these businesses showing the adjustments to results for the Annuities business that we would make from market unlockings and experience true-ups. Slide 6 highlights the Annuities business. After adjusting for reserve and DAC updates, Annuities earned $394 million for the quarter, an increase of $69 million from a year ago. Turning to Slide 7. Most of our operating earnings in the Annuities business come from base contract charges linked to account values. At the end of the second quarter, account values were just under $160 billion, with market appreciation driving a 13% increase from a year ago. The resulting increase in fee income was the leading cause of the earnings growth from the year-ago quarter. In addition, the rising account values have lowered the prospective costs of guaranteed death and income benefits associated with our contracts and have contributed to a more favorable DAC amortization rate, resulting in a reduced drag from charges for benefit costs and base amortization. These developments have contributed to a higher margin for the business, compounding the increase in fees to produce a 21% increase in earnings from the year-ago quarter. Slide 8 presents Individual Annuity sales. Our gross annuity sales for the quarter were $2.7 billion, up roughly $200 million from a year ago. As you see on this slide, the mix of our sales has changed significantly, reflecting our strategy to broaden the choices we can offer to retirement-focused clients and their advisors, while diversifying our risk exposure. Sales of our Prudential-defined income, or PDI, product, shown in the light blue portions of the pie charts, amounted to $530 million in the quarter or about 20% of overall sales. PDI directs a client's entire investment to a separate account fixed-income portfolio that we manage, and the product provides a guaranteed lifetime income amount, which is determined by applying an income payout rate based on the client's age at the time of purchase to the premium pay. The payout percentage grows at a contractual roll-up rate until lifetime withdrawals begin. The design of PDI allows us to change both the income payout rates and the roll-up rate for new business on a monthly basis, enabling us to keep pricing in sync with changing market conditions. For example, a purchaser of PDI today would receive a 50-basis-point lower roll-up rate and a lower initial payout rate than in the first quarter, since our current pricing gives effect to recent interest rate declines. Sales of our highest daily suite [ph], or HDI, products, shown in the dark blue portion of the pie charts, accounted for $1.9 billion of our current quarter sales compared to $2.1 billion a year ago. Substantially, all of the current quarter sales represent our current-generation product, HDI 3.0, which we introduced in February of this year. Similarly to PDI, HDI 3.0 allows us to change key pricing elements, including the roll-up rate for the protected withdrawal value that determines the base for lifetime income and withdrawal percentages for various age bands as often as monthly for new business. The remainder of our current quarter sales, about $300 million, represents Annuities without living benefit guarantees. To further broaden our product portfolio and enhance the solutions we can offer to client focused on tax-deferred asset growth potential, in April, we introduced our Prudential Premier investment variable annuity product, which does not offer these guarantees and unbundles guaranteed minimum death benefits as an optional add-on. Slide 9 highlights Retirement. The Retirement business reported adjusted operating income of $286 million for the current quarter, an increase of $7 million from a year ago. The increase came mainly from a greater contribution from net investment results. Current quarter results benefited by approximately $30 million from actions we've taken, mainly in the second half of last year, to reposition the portfolios supporting our pension risk transfer business, essentially migrating a portion of the portfolio from public fixed-income investments to private fixed income and commercial mortgages, consistent with our asset and liability management strategy for this business. This benefit was largely offset by lower income from non-coupon asset classes compared to a year ago. Returns on these investments exceeded our average expectations by about $10 million in the current quarter and exceeded our expectations by about $35 million in the year-ago quarter. Shown on Slide 10, total retirement gross deposits and sales were $6.6 billion for the current quarter compared to $8.1 billion a year ago. Full Service gross deposits and sales were $5.5 billion for the quarter compared to $3.7 billion a year ago. Attractive large case opportunities in the full service market are lumpy, leading to a variable sales pattern from one quarter to another. For example, during the first quarter of this year, we closed 5 case sales of over $100 million each, including a major case win for $2.6 billion, while current quarter new sales plans included only one case over $100 million, and the year-ago quarter had no case sales of that size. We had net outflows of $1.5 billion in Full Service Retirement for the current quarter, reflecting elevated plan lapses, including the impact of client merger and acquisition activity. Stand-alone Institutional gross sales were $2.1 billion in the current quarter compared to $4.4 billion a year ago. Current quarter sales included $1.1 billion of stable value wrap products, while the year-ago quarter included $3.5 billion of those sales. Taking advantage of a market opportunity over the past several years, we have grown the book of this fee-based business to over $70 billion. We are now seeing greater competition in the market for these products, with an increase in the number of wrap providers. Our stand-alone Institutional business had net outflows of $2.5 billion for the quarter, including withdrawals by stable value wrap clients seeking provider diversification. In addition, ongoing benefit payments on pension risk transfer cases reduced account values. Total Retirement account values amounted to $330.5 billion at the end of the second quarter, up by $29 billion from a year ago. Slide 11 highlights Asset Management. The Asset Management business reported adjusted operating income of $200 million for the current quarter compared to $172 million a year ago. The $28 million increase in earnings was mainly driven by higher asset management fees net of expenses, reflecting growth in assets under management. The segment's assets under management amounted to $921 billion at the end of the second quarter, including $547 billion managed for institutional and retail clients. This represents a 16% increase in third-party assets under management from a year ago, driven by market appreciation, along with about $15 billion of positive net flows over the past year. Current quarter results also benefited from an $11 million greater contribution from the segment's other activities. Slide 12 presents the results of our U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance businesses, showing the adjustments to Individual Life results for integration costs relating to the Hartford acquisition. Slide 13 highlights Individual Life. After adjusting for integration costs, Individual Life reported earnings of $166 million for the current quarter compared to $152 million a year ago. The increase in earnings reflects a greater contribution from net investment results, mainly driven by portfolio growth and lower expenses. The integration of the business we acquired from Hartford is well on track, and on a run rate basis, the current quarter benefited from realization of about 3/4 of our targeted $90 million of annual cost saves. Claims experience was favorable both in the current quarter and the year-ago quarter. The contribution to current quarter results from mortality experience, together with reserve updates, was about $15 million more favorable than our average expectation. Shown on Slide 14, Individual Life sales, based on annualized new business premiums, amounted to $103 million for the current quarter. This compares to sales of $184 million a year ago. The decrease was mainly driven by a $75 million decline in sales of guaranteed universal life insurance products, shown in the dark blue bars. This sales decline reflects actions we've taken to limit concentration in these products and to maintain appropriate returns, including a series of price increases. In addition, a number of competitors have taken steps to make their products relatively more attractive, and several companies have recently entered or increased their presence in the guaranteed universal life market. Term insurance sales, in the light blue bars, were down by $7 million from a year ago, reflecting price reductions by several competitors. In July, we announced pricing changes on several of our guaranteed universal life and term insurance products, allowing us to enhance our competitive position where we see opportunities to offer attractive value propositions with appropriate expected returns. Slide 15 highlights Group Insurance. Group Insurance earnings amounted to $46 million in the current quarter compared to $22 million a year ago. The increase was driven by more favorable claims experience both in disability and life. This is presented on Slide 16. In Group Disability, favorable current quarter claims experience drove an improvement of 9 percentage points in the benefit ratio compared to the year-ago quarter. This contrasts to an adverse fluctuation in the first quarter. While we've enhanced our claims management capabilities and are continuing to make progress in repricing cases as they renew, experience will vary from one quarter to another, and improvements won't be linear. Slide 17 presents the International Insurance division. Slide 18 highlights our Life Planner business. Our Life Planner business reported earnings of $382 million for the quarter, up $14 million from a year ago. Results continue to benefit from sustained business growth. On a constant-dollar basis, insurance revenues, including premiums, policy charges and fees, were up by 5% from a year ago. In addition, the current quarter benefited by about $20 million in comparison to a year ago from improved claims experience. We estimate that the mortality contribution to current quarter results was about $10 million more favorable than our average expectations. Higher expenses, driven mainly by technology and distribution costs, partly offset the benefits of business growth and improved claims experience. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates, which reflect our hedging of the yen income at JPY 82 this year versus JPY 80 last year, had a negative impact of $3 million on earnings in comparison to a year ago. Slide 19 highlights Gibraltar Life. Gibraltar Life reported earnings of $502 million for the current quarter, up $14 million from a year ago after adjusting for integration costs. The current quarter benefited from lower net expenses than a year ago, including some nonlinear items, such as fixed asset sales and technology costs. The current quarter also benefited from a greater contribution from net investment results, mainly driven by improved spread on fixed-income investments. Going the other way, policy benefits experience, including mortality and surrenders, was less favorable than in the year-ago quarter. While mortality was somewhat more favorable than a year ago, with a current quarter contribution about $10 million greater than our average expectations, the year-ago quarter benefited by about $30 million from gains on an elevated level of surrenders of non-yen fixed annuities. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact of $11 million in the comparison of results to a year ago. Turning to Slide 20. International Insurance sales, on a constant-dollar basis, were $769 million for the current quarter compared to $827 million a year ago. This is a product view of our sales. Our sales pattern has been affected by actions we've taken, including changes in our product lineup and commission rates. In addition, the seasonal sales trend favors the first quarter for our Japanese Life Planner business and the second quarter for Gibraltar Life. Our yen-based single-premium bank channel product, which we discontinued late last year after opportunistic sales of over $1 billion, contributed $62 million to sales of Gibraltar Life in the year-ago quarter, with minor residual sales through the fourth quarter of last year, as you can see in the brown bars. In December of [indiscernible], we've reduced commission rates on the yen-based retirement income products sold by our Prudential of Japan Life Planners in order to limit concentration. This product, shown in the gold bars, contributed $29 million to current quarter sales, down $28 million from a year ago. Sales of all other products, including those denominated in U.S. dollars, increased by $32 million in the current quarter from a year ago. This includes a $10 million increase in sales of our U.S. dollar-denominated whole life and retirement income products, shown in the light blue bars. Slide 21 shows Life Planner sales. Life Planner sales were $290 million in the current quarter compared to $277 million a year ago. Sales by our Life Planners in Japan were $185 million in the current quarter, down by $21 million from a year ago. In the gold bars, you can see the $28 million decline in sales of the yen-based retirement income product, affected by our change in commission rates that I mentioned. This more than offset an increase of $7 million or 5% in sales of other products, shown in the dark blue bars. Sales outside of Japan, in the light blue bars, were up by $34 million from a year ago, mainly driven by increases in Korea and Brazil. Slide 22 shows Gibraltar sales. Sales from Gibraltar Life were $479 million in the current quarter compared to $550 million a year ago. Sales by Life Consultants, in the dark blue bars, amounted to $232 million for the current quarter, down $24 million or 9% from the year-ago quarter. Our Life Consultant count has declined by about 1,100 or 11% from a year ago, as we implemented minimum production requirements and other quality standards for the sales force that came to us with the Star and Edison acquisitions. In addition, the sales comparison is affected by accelerated purchases of a number of our Japanese yen-based products in advance of price increases in April of last year, which resulted in sales that were reported in the second quarter of last year. Sales through the bank channel, shown in the gold bars, amounted to $167 million for the current quarter, down $51 million from a year ago. This decrease reflects the $62 million of sales of the discontinued single-premium product in the year-ago quarter that I mentioned, partly offset by an $11 million increase in sales of other products. We are emphasizing recurring-premium Death Protection products and life insurance policies with premium-paying periods of 10 years or longer comprised about 1/3 of overall current quarter sales in the bank channel compared to just over 10% a year ago. Sales through independent agents, shown in the light blue bars, amounted to $80 million in the current quarter, up modestly from a year ago. Moving to Slide 23. Corporate and Other operations reported a loss of $341 million for the current quarter. This compares to a $331 million loss a year ago after adjusting for a write-off of bond issue costs. The increase in the loss reflects higher net expenses in the current quarter, including the impact of a lower pension credit. The benefit of lower interest expense reflecting our refinancing of high coupon debt last year was a partial offset. Now I'll turn it over to Rob. Robert Michael Falzon : Thanks, Mark. I'm going to provide you an update on some key items under the heading of Financial Strength and Flexibility. Starting on Slide 24. We continue to manage our insurance companies to levels of capital that we believe are consistent with AA standards. As of year-end, Prudential Insurance reported an RBC ratio of 456%, with total adjusted capital, or TAC, of $13.9 billion. While we don't perform a quarterly bottoms-up RBC calculation, we estimate that our RBC ratio continues to be well above our 400% target at Prudential Insurance, after giving effect to the results for the first half of the year. In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margins of 777% and 955%, respectively, as of March 31, their fiscal year-end. These reported solvency margins are also well above our targets. Looking at the overall capital position for the Financial Services businesses on Slide 25. We calculate our on-balance sheet capital capacity by comparing the statutory capital position of Prudential Insurance to our preset RBC ratio target and then add capital capacity held at the parent and other subsidiaries. As of year-end, we estimated that our on-balance sheet capital capacity was about $3.5 billion, including about $1.5 billion that we considered readily deployable. During the first half of this year, we've returned about $1 billion to shareholders. These returns came in the form of quarterly common stock dividends of $0.53 per share in each quarter, for a total of about $500 million, and a repurchase of $500 million of our common stock. The net results of these returns of capital and the capital generated by our businesses in excess of their organic growth needs left us with available on-balance sheet capital capacity of over $5 billion, including about $1.5 billion that we consider readily deployable. Our $500 million of share repurchases in the first half of the year, including $250 million in the second quarter, completed the $1 billion of repurchases authorized under the program that ended on June 30 of this year. As you know, we announced a new $1 billion repurchase authorization in June, which extends through June 30 of next year. Turning to the cash position of the parent company. Cash and short-term investments, net of outstanding commercial paper, amounted to $4.1 billion as of the end of the second quarter. The cash in excess of our targeted $1.3 billion liquidity cushion is available to repay maturing operating debt, to fund operating needs and to deploy, over time, for strategic and capital management purposes. Now I'll turn it back over to John John Robert Strangfeld : Thank you, Rob. And we would like to open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Erik Bass with Citi. Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : I was hoping that you could provide some more details on the economics of the BT longevity swap transaction. And how should we think about the earnings contribution? Also, how do returns for longevity swaps compare to those for pension closeouts? Stephen P. Pelletier: Erik, this is Steve. I'd be glad to address that. The returns on both longevity transactions and funded transactions are very much consistent with our corporate ROE objectives. In regard to looking at longevity deals, vis-\u00e0-vis funded deals, I'd point to 2 key distinctions. First would be the relative capital intensivity [ph] of these transactions. Obviously, every deal is different, and you need to account for that. But if you were going to use a general rule of thumb that said that longevity deals are about 1/5 as capital intensive per dollar of notional amount as funded deals, that would be pretty accurate. The key distinction there obviously being that, in longevity reinsurance, we're not taking on the assets and therefore, not taking on the credit risk that characterizes funded deals. The second point I would make is the emergence of earnings. The longevity reinsurance and funded transactions are highly complementary in this regard. So from both a strategic and a financial aspect, being active in both sides of the market in that regard is very attractive to us. Funded deals, the earnings level -- the annual earnings level gradually decreases over time. In longevity reinsurance transactions, the earnings emergence gradually increases over time. So those are the 2 key distinctions I would make. Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : That's helpful. So I guess, is the right way to think about then kind of a ballpark, maybe 1% to 2% of the amount swapped is a reasonable estimate for kind of the required capital? Stephen P. Pelletier: Yes, I think that would be fair. Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. And then, I guess one follow-up is that we've seen a number of longevity swap transactions in the U.K. but very little activity in the U.S. And what do you think is driving this? And is there any reason that longevity swaps wouldn't become more prevalent in the U.S. over time? Stephen P. Pelletier: I think the longevity market may well develop in the U.S. Certainly, the U.K. has been the leader in that. We also look for potential emergence of the longevity market in Canada, and the U.S. may well follow. But no question that, for us and for the market, in general, the U.K. has been the main leader in longevity reinsurance activity. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JP Morgan. Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : A couple of questions. First, on the earnings overall. Obviously, the $2.49 number was pretty strong. You mentioned in the release the DAC unlocking in Individual Annuity, also the Hartford Life integration costs. But wondering if you could just highlight some of the other items, whether they were seasonal or related to mortality, morbidity or non-coupon income that might have inflated the reported earnings numbers. And how do we think about earnings going from third -- second quarter to the third quarter? And I think, Mark, you mentioned some of those in your remarks, but if you could just highlight those. And then, secondly, on the Life Planner business. The Life Planner count was down this quarter, and it slowed -- the growth in that has slowed over the last few years. Can you still grow sales in the Life Planner business in Japan if your Life Planner count growth remains sluggish and remains in the sort of low-single-digit range? Charles Frederick Lowrey : Sure. Jimmy, let me -- this is Charlie. Let me take the second one first, and then we'll get back to you on the first one. Let me go through the Life Planner count in Japan, and then I might just comment on the rest of the Life Planner count as well. But in Japan, when you think about Life Planners, there are really 3 ins and outs to the business, and you really have to peel back the onion and look at them. So first, there are the recruits and the terminations, how many people do you actually recruit during a quarter and how many people leave for a variety of reasons. And that was about normal. The second is, as you know, we take Life Planners and some Life Planners choose to become sales managers. And the sales manager's job is to recruit, develop and retain Life Planners. And so over time and in different quarters, you'll get a number of different Life Planners who choose to become sales managers. In this particular quarter, we had more Life Planners who want to become sales managers. That is actually a good thing for the future because we expect the increase in sales managers, over time, to help with Life Planner recruiting in the future. So that actually bodes well in the long term. The third area is when Life Planners go to the bank channel. And here, these are the secondies [ph] we actually introduce into the bank channel. And here, what we do is we take lower-performing LPs, or Life Planners, and give them the opportunity to become secondies [ph] in the bank channel. And as you know, we only hire 2 or 3 applicants out of every 100. We're extremely finicky about who we actually choose to become a Life Planner. And we train them incredibly well to perform 3 different tasks, and that's to prospect, present and to close. But if an LP fails, an LP usually fails because he or she can't prospect. That's the toughest part of the job. But in banks, they don't need to prospect. So as secondies [ph] to the bank, they can perform really well over time. And that's what's happened in this particular quarter as well, is we had more LPs go to become secondies [ph] in the bank channel. So as a result, Japan was down some. If these folks hadn't transferred, the growth rate would have been about the long-term average that POJ has, which is sort of 1% to 2%. But the growth rate isn't unlikely to materially accelerate in terms of hiring LPs because of the number of LPs we have and also our maniacal focus on quality. We're not going to change the quality of our hiring. But I think the long-term average has been sort of 1% to 2%. It'll probably be that way in the future as we go forward. And that's really Japan. In Brazil, it's a slightly different story. You have -- Brazil's up a lot, about 25%. So we have over 800 Life Planners. And there, we expect, in some of our other markets, we would grow Life Planners at a more rapid rate. Eric Durant : Jimmy, it's Eric. Let me just take... Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : And actually, just one follow-up on that. The sales have exceeded -- sales growth has done better than the Life Planner count has done recently. So can you keep that up? And do you see further improvements in that business, especially in Japan? Charles Frederick Lowrey : I think you may see some improvement, probably not on the productivity side, because Life Planners already are at a very high level of productivity. On the premium side, over time, what we've seen is that there has been a sort of constant -- and this is over time. It'll vary from year to year, quarter to quarter. But there has been an increase in premium over time. Not going to be huge, but it will add to the growth rate that you would expect on the Life Planner side. Eric Durant : Jimmy, it's Eric. Let me have at your first question. We had a number of favorable items in the second quarter that may not be trend-able, and that amounted to about $100 million altogether pretax. They would include, in the Retirement segment, non-coupon investment income about $10 million higher than our average expectation. We had favorable mortality in Individual Life, in the Life Planner businesses and in Gibraltar, again with experience being more favorable than our average expectation. The amounts there are $15 million, $10 million and $11 million, respectively. We had favorable seasonality at Gibraltar, as Mark mentioned, that we estimate was about $30 million in comparison to the first quarter and all else the same in comparison to the third quarter. And we had a favorable level of net expenses in Gibraltar of about $20 million. So again, all else the same, you would expect the expenses to be about $20 million higher in the third quarter than in the second quarter. Again, the sum of all these items is about $100 million. It's actually $96 million or about $0.12 a share. Operator : Next, we'll go to the line of Tom Gallagher with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Just, first, a quick one on the Retirement business. Just given the visibility that John mentioned to open the call on the deals that have been booked so far in 3Q, in terms of the PRT and the longevity deal, do you have visibility that flows will be meaningfully positive in 3Q? That was my first question. John Robert Strangfeld : I wouldn't look to characterize our overall Retirement flows in the third quarter, Tom, the way that, for example, the longevity reinsurance deal for BT will show up, as it will show up in our flows and in our account values, but it won't show up on our balance sheet, given the fact that we're not holding assets vis-\u00e0-vis that deal. I would also point out that while we're very pleased about the kind of multiple transaction count in the month of July, we think it reflects a good pace of activity and good pace of our profile in that industry. The other 2 transactions, while we're very happy about them, they were significantly smaller. One was a longevity deal for about $1.7 billion, and the other was a funded deal for approximately $350 million. Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. And also just to follow up on the Full Service side. Just given some of the items you laid out on the large cases that went away this quarter or lapsed this quarter, would you expect some improvement there? Or is it just hard to tell, given the lumpiness of that business? John Robert Strangfeld : I think it is, as you say, Tom, inherently lumpy. The -- what we saw in this quarter was actually, on the Full Service side, some pretty good flow in terms of transaction count and number of deals we closed. However, only one of them was above the $100 million mark that we use to characterize large transactions and that one just barely, while we had 4 lapses that we'd characterize as large and a significant portion of that was driven by M&A activity, in other words, our clients being acquired and the business being merged away from us to the other provider. And that's obviously inherently difficult to predict. But we're -- while we still see this as a very, very competitive business and we do not see that there's any near-term change in the -- in those competitive dynamics, we're pleased with the degree of activity that we see in this business. We're pleased with the condition of our pipeline. I think that's reflective of the investments we've made in the business, so that is encouraging. Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. And then just one last one for me, if I could shift gears to Japan. The -- just, I guess, more of a broad industry question. We're seeing this with peers, too, that the sales environment seems to be becoming more challenging. I'm not sure if that's a function of the currency-related products that were sold and now those have become less attractive or has the competition just intensified. Can you give a bit more color with what's going on, whether it's on the sales front or the recruiting side? Charles Frederick Lowrey : Sure. I'll take the recruiting first. We don't see in -- we don't see a lot greater competition there because we recruit a very different kind of individual. So what we look for are generally people who haven't been in the insurance industry before but have sales experience that want to do something different, that want to be more in charge of their own compensation structure. And as a result, we continue to recruit a fair number of people. By a fair number of people, meaning the level that we want. So on the recruitment side, we don't see a lot of competition in the vein in which we operate. In terms of products, I would almost say the same thing. There is a fair amount of competition. There's a lot of competition for individual products in the third sector. And in the first sector, if you say just life insurance and savings, we concentrate on Death Protection. That is the core of what we do, and we see less and less people in the death protection market. In other words, a lot of people are moving over into savings products, and savings products are more competitive in terms of pricing. But in terms of traditional life insurance, in which we operate, we -- first of all, we compete as much on service as we do on pricing. And second of all, we are able to hold our prices. So we still feel pretty good about the margins we're getting and the products that we're selling. We have tapped the brake on certain products, as Mark talked about, whether it's the yen retirement income product or in the bank channel, the single-premium yen-denominated whole life. We obviously slammed on the brakes there, but that was our doing for specific purposes. Much have had to do with business mix as opposed to profitability. So on the profitability side, we still feel very good about what we offer, but more importantly, how we offer it. We -- it's a very different kind of sale. We have a needs-based selling process that we started in Japan 25 years ago, and we still adhere to that. So our core is Death Protection. Our core is leads-based [ph] selling, and our core is quality recruits. And we're continuing with that strategy. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Nadel with Sterne Agee. John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : A question on Gibraltar, and I know upfront in the prepared remarks you talked about, over time, the life consultant count there starting to stabilize. But as you've implemented these higher production standards, particularly for the Edison and Star consultants, are -- where in the ballgame are you? Are you in the late innings there in terms of stabilizing that agent count? Should we expect that to fall significantly from here still or no? Charles Frederick Lowrey : Yes. I think you will still see it fall a little bit. I'd say we're in late innings, but we may have some extended innings. So let me just expand on that. In terms of the life consultant count, the rate of decreasing is decreasing, if you will. So we're down 11% this quarter. We were down 14% last quarter, 18% the previous quarter and 20% the quarter before that, so 20%, 18%, 14%, 11%. You can do the math. It's going to continue to come down, and we'll bottom out at some point probably late this year, first half of next year. But it's going exactly as we thought. But interestingly, in terms of the metrics, we're doing well. So in other words, the things that we hoped would happen and expected to happen, frankly, are. So John talked about productivity. Productivity has gone back to the pre-acquisition levels, as we had expected it would. 13-month persistency has increased from 89 -- sort of 89.5% back up to 91%. That's not quite up to the level we had before pre-acquisition, but we're getting back to that level. And finally, the policy -- policies are increasing in size. In other words, the in-force face amount has stayed relatively constant, but the number of policies has decreased slightly. And what that means, it gets back to my previous comment, which is this really makes sense, given the focus on Death Protection, as opposed to Star/Edison, which was really pushing more savings products. So our focus is Death Protection. You're seeing that in the metrics coming out, and you're seeing us, again, focus on quality of life consultants. So numbers will continue to come down for a little while, but they are, as you can see, in the bottoming-out phase. And again, that will probably happen in the next -- by the end of the year, first half of next year, something like that. But this is going all -- along exactly as we planned. John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Okay. That's helpful, Charlie. And then, a question on the Annuities segment. On a core basis, excluding some of these discrete items, it looks like the pretax ROA for that segment continues to run right around 100 basis points. Maybe it's slightly higher than that. So other than equity market performance, is there any reason why that level of ROA for the business should shift from current levels? Would the shift over time, for instance, toward the PDI product, alter this return profile? Stephen P. Pelletier: John, it's Steve. Equity markets will continue to be the major impact on the ROA going forward, the equity markets, in relation to our expectations. The business is at scale. The business is able to add business flows and account values without significant increase in expenses, so the ROA will continue to benefit from that. The -- in regard to the differentiation between PDI and HDI, those would not make a hugely significant impact on the ROA. There is a differentiation in fee basis between the 2 types of business, but if you're looking at the overall book of business, the -- that would not have a material impact on ROA. Mark B. Grier: Yes. John, also remember the mix of the in-force. Yes, remember the mix of the in-force. PDI is still small. John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Yes, understood. And then, if I could sneak one last one in for you. Maybe a little bit more philosophical for you on capital management. I know you've talked in the past about wanting to be a consistent buyer of your shares over time. And clearly, since you reintroduced the buyback, $250 million quarter has been right on. I'm wondering how you square that with the fact that your first half results are arguably the best first half -- best 6-month period Prudential has ever had, yet your stock is down 6% year-to-date against the overall market, which is up 4%, and you're underperforming most of your peers. So I'm just curious why you wouldn't advance the pace of your buybacks when your stock is underperforming the way it is. Robert Michael Falzon : John, it's Rob. I think the simple answer to that question is that we do not use stock buybacks to express a view on the relevant value of [indiscernible]. Rather, what we do is we look at buybacks as a deployment of excess capital that we generate on an annual basis, and we had sort of a waterfall that we've described and how we like to redeploy that. Obviously, it's, first, to finance the internal growth of our businesses; secondly, to provide for inorganic growth, like our PRT business, for M&A and also, to provide a return to our shareholders. And we do that through the combination of the dividend and the stock buybacks. So not influenced by perception of relevant value of the stock in terms of the priority of how we would distribute that capital. John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : No, I guess, I'd just -- I'd ask you guys to consider it. There are times when investors will be more interested in building positions in your stock than at other times, and I think this would be one of those times. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Mark, can you update us on what you view as the prospects for passage in the House of the bill to create a separate capital standard for the non-bank SIFI insurers? Mark B. Grier: Well, handicapping the political process is not my cup of tea. I will point out that there's a lot of momentum, significant sponsorship from both sides of the aisle and endorsements of the idea from a lot of different places, not just confined to Congress. But I can't tell you what's involved in making this happen and how that might play out. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. On a related issue, the treatment of corporate bond investments for life insurers without the ability to apply ratings from the rating agency seems to be something that needs to be addressed over time. Do you have any ideas on how that could be taken care of? Mark B. Grier: Well, let me start, and then I'll hand it over to Rob. There are approaches to this credit evaluation and link of solvency and capital that reflect the things that we think are important, particularly the probability of default and loss given default. And I'll let Rob add some comments to that. Robert Michael Falzon : Yes. So first and foremost, we expect that credit quality-sensitive capital construct for insurers would have to evolve. It would be imprudent for something other than that to manifest itself in sort of whatever regulatory outcome occurs here. With respect to the reliance on the rating agencies, there is a number of ways to do a workaround around that. Specifically within our own organization, we have internal ratings for all of our privates, including both the corporate bonds and the mortgages that we underwrite. And on the public side, we have mechanisms for being able to back into equivalent ratings without having to have to rely on the rating agency ratings themselves. And I suspect other institutions can get to the same place as well. So we don't view the lack of our reliance -- or the lack of the ability to rely specifically on the rating agencies to be -- as being an impediment to having a credit-sensitive metric ultimately put in place. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. So that should be able to have a workaround related to -- for the regulators treating all bond investments the same, regardless of rating, at least from an external rating standpoint? Robert Michael Falzon : We certainly would think so. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Schwartz with Raymond James. Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : A couple of questions going back to the BP [ph] pension -- longevity deal, excuse me. First, I'm flashing [ph] on Met's [ph] Investor Day and former CEO talking about problems in the U.K. with regards to regulation in that marketplace. It has become -- it had become significantly more difficult, significantly more conservative. Is that something that has not occurred on the longevity side? Stephen P. Pelletier: Steven, it's Steve Pelletier. I'd make a couple of comments. First of all, remember that in longevity, we are focusing purely on just that, on longevity reinsurance and not taking on the assets. Second, I'd emphasize the point that in these transactions, both the BT deal and the other longevity deal that I mentioned, we are operating strictly on an offshore basis. And that is a key distinction there. The regulatory picture is very different for us given that posture. Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay, got it. And then, just one more quick one on the accounting for the longevity deal. I think you said that it was going to be in your flows, but -- the $27 billion I assume, but not on the -- not in your balance sheet. How will this be reflected in the earnings statement? Is it a premium and an associated loss? Or any ideas? Robert Michael Falzon : It's Rob. Essentially, you'll see a net fee coming through each quarter, representing the -- sort of the risk premium fee being applied. Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay. Plus whatever the payments are, I guess. Or is that netted out? Robert Michael Falzon : Well, the payments will be in exchange of the premium payments and then any benefit payment outflows that we need to make in accordance with fulfilling our obligation. Operator : We'll take our final question from the line of Eric Berg with RBC Capital Markets. Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : I just had one question that I'm hoping you can elaborate on, something that perhaps we've touched on in the past in this forum, which is the changing mortality tables, or the changing lifespan tables that are coming in the pension area. While I realize that, that's not going to affect company's cash immediately as they restate their liabilities upward, it's going to have the effect of, all else the same, increasing underfunded-ness as the Society of Actuaries table is instituted, I guess, at the end of this year. My question is, what's your best sense of how plan sponsors will respond? Will they adjust to this change by just putting more cash into their plan? Or will they say, \"We've had enough of this underfunded-ness,\" and they'll do more pension risk transfers? How will the typical CFO or Treasurer respond to this change in mortality table? Stephen P. Pelletier: Eric, it's Steve. I assume there will be some degree of response that covers both the bases you mentioned. But we certainly do look for the new mortality tables to, across -- pretty much on an overall basis, increase propensity to transactions. We think that aside from funding levels, there are a couple of -- as we highlighted on Investor Day, there are a couple of fundamental things going on in the marketplace in terms of how plan sponsors look at this liability. One is the new mortality tables, and the other is PBGC premium. And so we think that the ongoing trends on both those fronts will increase propensity to transact. Mark B. Grier: And this highlights longevity risk, and one of the big motives for transacting is the pure risk dimension. And this kind of puts it right in front of everybody again.

Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the third quarter 2014 earnings teleconference. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Finkelstein. Please go ahead. Mark Finkelstein : Thank you, Cynthia. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today's call are John Strangfeld, CEO; Mark Grier, Vice Chairman; Charlie Lowrey, Head of International Businesses; Steve Pelletier, Head of Domestic Businesses; Rob Falzon, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by John, Mark and Rob, and then we will answer your questions. In order help you understand Prudential Financial, we will make some forward-looking statements in the following presentation. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. Additional information regarding factors that could cause such a difference appears in the section titled Forward-looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures of our earnings press release for the third quarter of 2014, which can be found on our website at www.investor.prudential.com. In addition, this presentation may include references to adjusted operating or to earnings per share, or EPS; or return on equity, or ROE, which are determined based on adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP measure of performance of our Financial Services businesses that excludes certain items. Adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, GAAP, and the excluded items are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations. For a reconciliation of adjusted operating income to the comparable GAAP measure, please see our earnings press release on our website. Additional historical information relating to the company's financial performance is also located on our website. John, I'll hand it over to you. John Robert Strangfeld : Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Prudential reported another good quarter, and we are on track to meet or exceed our financial goals for the year. Mark and Rob will walk you through the specifics impacting our drivers, results and capital position. I will focus my comments on overall highlights and themes. The key message is we are pleased with where we are as a company and with our strategic initiatives designed to drive long-term growth and sustain returns above industry averages. Excluding the impact of market-driven and discrete items, our year-to-date adjusted operating income per share is 12% higher than a year ago. Results have benefited from favorable investment results and better-than-expected underwriting margins in our insurance businesses. While these are clear tailwinds, the underlying fundamentals of our businesses are performing well, and I will highlight just a few for the quarter. Our Annuities business continues to show good core margins and returns. Mark will walk through the results of our annual actuarial assumption update, but we remain confident in the products we're selling, the risk profile of the business and the returns we're achieving. In Asset Management, our third-party assets under management have increased 11% over the prior year, with total net flows over the last 4 quarters of $12 billion. While we saw modest net outflows this quarter, this, after 22 consecutive quarters of positive net flows, importantly, our overall investment performance remained strong. Individual Life earnings reflect strong mortality performance in the quarter. And while this will vary, we have shown variable mortality experience relative to expectations in 8 of the last 9 quarters. Our International business reported solid results. Our Life Planner count grew sequentially about 2% and delivered solid year-over-year sales growth in each key market. At Gibraltar, we are seeing the benefits of the actions we have taken to improve the productivity of Life Consultant. Sales through this channel were essentially unchanged from the prior year despite a 7% decline in our Life Consultant count. Now I'd like to spend a few moments discussing the Retirement business, and specifically, pension risk transfer or, as we call, PRT. Since June 30, we have completed or announced 5 transactions that could be considered larger deals by market standards. This includes 2 funded pension buyouts, where we were taking on about $4.5 billion in pension liabilities and 3 longevity reinsurance transactions where we're assuming the longevity risk on approximately $31 billion in pension liabilities. While we have been in the pension buyout business for decades, our success in winning larger PRT deals is directly attributable to the investment we began to make in 2006 when we first identified the opportunity at the larger end of the market. At that time, we built a dedicated team and supplemented this team with resources across Prudential. As many of you know, it took 6 years until we successfully executed the 2 largest pension buyout transactions ever in 2012, the GM and Verizon contracts. Our ability to evaluate, structure and close these complex transactions in a timely way and to seamlessly onboard over 150,000 retirees has given us proven market credibility, which helps us succeed on subsequent transactions, like the 5 we announced since June. And importantly, our process of evaluating these transactions, which involves many layers of oversight, have remained consistent and disciplined. To sum up, we're excited about the success we have had shown in this business, and we like the risk and return profiles of the transactions we've announced. And we view pension risk transfer as a source of future growth given our track record, our reputation for successfully executing large and complex deals and the long-term growth characteristics of the market. On another matter, we're also excited with the recently announced memorandum of understanding to partner with ILC that will lead to Prudential indirectly acquiring 34% to 40% of AFP Habitat, a leading Chilean retirement services provider. We view this as an attractive use of capital to participate in the growing Chilean pension market and build on our Latin American businesses, while doing so with an equal partner that has a strong track record and a terrific reputation in the local market. With that, I'll hand it over to Mark. Mark B. Grier: Thanks, John. Good morning, good afternoon or good evening. Thanks for joining us on the call today. I'll take you through our results for the quarter. And then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon, who will cover our capital and liquidity picture. I'll start with an overview of our financial results for the quarter. [Technical Difficulty] Mark B. Grier: Hello. I'm back. Our system somehow went on mute by itself. I'll start over. I'll take you through the results for the quarter. And then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon, who will cover our capital and liquidity picture. And I apologize for the interruption. I'll start with an overview of our financial results for the quarter shown on Slide 2. On a reported basis, common stock earnings per share amounted to $2.20 for the third quarter based on after tax adjusted operating income of the Financial Services businesses. This compares to EPS of $2.89 a year ago. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items in both the current quarter and the year-ago quarter and the benefit of the current quarter results from a favorable catch-up in our effective tax rate, EPS was up 5%, amounting to $2.46 this quarter compared to $2.34 a year ago. Looking across our businesses, here are the main drivers of this comparison. We benefited from higher fees reflecting growth and account values in our Annuities business and the contribution of recent longevity reinsurance transactions and retirement. Our Asset Management business benefited from strong performance-based fees in the current quarter. Our Individual Life and Group Insurance businesses benefited from more favorable claims experience. And in our International Insurance business, higher expenses, including technology costs in the current quarter, coupled with less favorable foreign currency exchange rates, more than offset the benefit of continued business growth in the year-over-year comparison. On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $465 million for the current quarter. This reflects a non-AOI charge to increase our embedded derivative liability for annuity living benefits, largely driven by our annual actuarial review and reflects the loss from foreign currency remeasurement driven by weakening of the Japanese yen. The foreign currency remeasurement that affects our net income is an accounting presentation mismatch, and it does not reflect the economics of our currency-matched assets and liabilities in Japan. We hold currency-matched assets to support the non-yen liabilities of our Japanese insurance companies, and the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on the liabilities runs through the income statement, while the offsetting impact on the assets is included in accumulated other comprehensive income or AOCI. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, and after adjusting the numbers to remove the impact of this FX remeasurement mismatch, amounted to $64.89 at the end of the third quarter, up $4.90 from last year end, after payment of 3 quarterly dividends totaling $1.59 per share. Growth in book value plus dividends paid exceeded 10%. We also evaluate our ROE performance after adjusting for the FX remeasurement mismatch, which benefited our reported ROE by reducing the denominator. After removing this benefit, along with the impact on results from market-driven and discrete items, our annualized ROE for the first 9 months of the year would be about 16%. This reflects solid underlying performance across our businesses with tailwinds from strong non-coupon investment results and mortality more favorable on our average expectations in Individual Life and International Insurance. Slide 3 presents the AOI impact of our assumption updates. This years' annual review of actuarial assumptions had a net unfavorable impact of $186 million on pretax adjusted operating income or $0.26 per share. The most significant items are $107 million charge in Group Insurance to strengthen long-term disability reserves, including an update of our estimate for the benefit of Social Security claims offsets, and a $63 million charge in Individual Life to adjust the amortization and reserves giving effect to refinements in our approach to estimating gross profits and guaranteed benefit costs. Turning to Slide 4. The remainder of this quarter's list of market-driven and discrete items included in our results is short. In the Annuities business, performance of our separate account funds in the current quarter was less favorable than our expectations, and we strengthened our reserves for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits and adjusted DAC, resulting in a net charge of $0.07 per share. And in Individual Life, we absorbed integration cost of about $0.01 per share related to the Hartford Life acquisition. In total, the items I just mentioned, including the impact of the annual actuarial reserve, had a net unfavorable impact of $0.34 per share on third quarter results. In addition, a favorable catch-up in our effective tax rate contributed $0.08 per share to our results for the current quarter, mitigating a portion of the impact of the market-driven and discrete items. This catch-up reflects a downward change in our estimate of the full year effective rate applicable to our pretax adjusted operating income. During the year-ago quarter, market-driven and discrete items produced a net benefit of $0.55 per share, mainly driven by favorable DAC and reserve updates in the annuity business, reflecting the annual review of actuarial assumptions and strong performance of our separate account funds in the quarter. Moving to Slide 5. On a GAAP basis, our net income of $465 million in the current quarter includes amounts characterized as net realized investment losses of $1.1 billion, comprised of the items you see here. The $970 million loss from product-related embedded derivatives and hedging included a $631 million charge from the annual actuarial review for variable annuities, largely driven by updated lapse assumptions. While our experience on living benefit guarantees is still limited, enhanced analytics, combined with industry data, has enabled us to refine our approach in predicting customer behavior. The key refinements include making expected lapses on products with living benefit guarantees sensitive to the level of interest rates. These changes caused us to lower our expected level of lapses for most of our contracts in-force. The charge reflects GAAP guidelines for valuing embedded derivatives, including a risk-neutral framework for estimating growth and account values over decades. We believe that this accounting paradigm overstates the true liability, and the result would be different under conventional insurance accounting. The remainder of the $970 million loss from product-embedded derivatives and hedging reflected mark-to-market on our GAAP liability for variable annuity living benefits, including the impact of changes in interest rates during the quarter. Foreign currency remeasurement, driven by a weakening of the Japanese yen in relation to the U.S. dollar and other currencies in which we issue products in Japan, resulted in a pretax loss of $576 million for the current quarter. Impairments and credit losses on investments were $37 million for the quarter. Going the other way, mark-to-market on derivatives, mainly related to management of currency exposures and asset liability durations, resulted in a $328 million pretax gain, and general portfolio activities, mainly in our International Insurance operations, resulted in net pretax gains of $123 million. Moving to our business results and starting on Slide 6. This slide shows our U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management businesses. This is a view of the results of these businesses showing the adjustments we made for actuarial reviews, market unlockings and experienced true-ups to get a view of underlying performance relative to a year ago. Slide 7 highlights Individual Annuities. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, annuities results were $403 million for the quarter, an increase of $33 million from a year ago. Turning to Slide 8. Most of our operating earnings in the annuities business come from base contract charges linked to daily account values. Measured point to point, account values at the end of the third quarter increased by 6% from a year ago, driven by market appreciation over the past year. However, the increase in average daily account values for the quarter outstripped the point-to-point increase, producing a 10% increase in policy charges and fees. The benefit of higher fees, net of associated expenses, was partly offset by a lower contribution from investment results, resulting in a 9% increase in earnings from the year-ago quarter. Slide 9 shows the trend in annuity sales. Our gross annuity sales for the quarter were $2.6 billion, up by roughly $200 million from a year ago. Net sales were $392 million. We've adapted our variable annuity product line to diversify the risk exposures associated with our product guarantees and to enhance our ability to maintain appropriate pricing and return expectations under changing market conditions. As you see on this slide, our Prudential-defined income, or PDI product, has become a significant contributor to our sales mix. Sales of PDI, shown in the light blue bars, amounted to $459 million or about 20% of overall sales for the current quarter, roughly consistent with the contribution over the past few quarters and about double the relative contribution of a year ago. PDI directs a client's entire investment to a separate account, fixed-income portfolio that we manage. And PDI provides a guaranteed lifetime income amount, which is determined by applying an income payout percentage, which is based on the client's age at time of purchase to the premium paid. The payout percentage grows at a contractual roll-up rate until lifetime withdrawals begin. The design of PDI allows us to change both the income payout rate and the roll-up rate for new business, enabling us to keep pricing in sync with changes in market conditions, including interest rates. Since PDI allows us to reprice more rapidly than other lifetime income guarantee products in the marketplace, its competitive position changes as we maintain appropriate target in returns, and our sales are an outcome of that process. Sales of our highest daily suite, or HDI products, shown in the dark blue bars, accounted for $1.8 billion of our current quarter sales, down slightly from the year-ago quarter. Similar to PDI, our current generation product, HDI 3.0, also allows us to change key pricing elements, including the roll-up rate for protected withdrawal value that determines the base for lifetime income and the withdrawal percentages for various age band as often as monthly for new business. The remainder of our current quarter sales, about $300 million, represents annuities without living benefit guarantees. This includes early sales of our recently introduced Prudential Premier Investment Variable Annuity product, which does not offer these guarantees and unbundles guaranteed minimum death benefits as an optional add-on. We see a market opportunity in serving clients who are focused on tax-deferred asset growth potential and are in the initial stages of introducing this product to our distribution partners. Slide 10 highlights the Retirement business. After stripping out the impact of refinements reflecting our annual actuarial reviews, earnings for the Retirement business amounted to $269 million for the current quarter, an increase of $28 million from a year ago. The increase was largely driven by a $21 million greater contribution from net investment results. Investment income for the current quarter includes about $35 million of returns that we would consider to be above-average expectation on non-coupon asset classes. The remainder of the increase in earnings came mainly from higher fees, including the contribution from the longevity reinsurance transactions that closed in July, partly offset by higher expenses. Turning to Slide 11. Total retirement gross deposits and sales for the current quarter were $36.2 billion, including $29 billion for the 2 significant longevity reinsurance transactions that we closed in July, covering about 212,000 retirees in total. Unlike funded pension risk transfer transactions like GM and Verizon, where we took on both asset risk and longevity risk, in these transactions we assumed only the risk of participant longevity and the cash flows take the form of monthly fees and net settlements, rather than a significant transfer of assets to us on day 1. Since we haven't taken on significant asset risk, the capital charges per dollar of notional amount are substantially lower than they would be in a funded transaction. We are now separately reporting the balances for longevity reinsurance, investment-only stable value wraps and group annuities, including funded pension risk transfer cases in our financial supplement. This provides additional transparency given their different economics in relation to notional amount. Excluding the longevity reinsurance transaction, stand-alone institutional gross sales were roughly $2 billion in the current quarter compared to $5 billion a year ago. Current quarter sales include $660 million from stable value wrap products, while the year-ago quarter included $4.1 billion of those sales. With about $70 billion of this fee-based business on the books, as of September 30, we face concentration limits with a number of counter-parties, and competition has increased in the market for these products with a greater number of wrap providers. Full Service gross deposits and sales, shown in the dark blue bars, were $5.2 billion for the quarter compared to $5.5 billion a year ago. The timing of attractive large case opportunities in the full service market leads to a variable sales pattern from one quarter to another. During the current quarter, we closed 3 cases of over $100 million each, totaling about $800 million, while the year-ago quarter included a major case win for $1.3 billion. Total Retirement account values amounted to $356 billion at the end of the third quarter, up by $44 billion from a year ago. Slide 12 highlights the Asset Management business. The Asset Management business reported adjusted operating income of $200 million for the current quarter compared to $173 million a year ago. While most of the segment's results come from Asset Management fees, the increase from the year-ago quarter included a $21 million greater contribution from what we call the other related revenues, which includes incentive, transaction, strategic investing and commercial mortgage activities. This was driven by strong performance-based incentive fees in the quarter. The contribution from other related revenues, which amounted to $36 million for the current quarter, is inherently variable since it reflects changing valuation and the timing of transactions. The benefits of results of continued growth in Asset Management fees was largely offset by higher expenses in the current quarter. The segment's assets under management amounted to $918 billion at the end of the third quarter, including $544 billion managed for institutional and retail clients. Third-party AUM increased by 11% from a year ago, driven by market appreciation along with about $12 billion of net flows over the past year. Net institutional outflows of $1.4 billion in the current quarter were driven by equities and included some client rebalancing of portfolios to reduce the weighting of some domestic equity product classes. These outflows were largely offset by net retail inflows of $1.2 billion. Slide 13 shows the results of our U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance businesses, showing the adjustments for refinements and updates reflecting our actual reviews and showing the Hartford integration costs in Individual Life. Slide 14 highlights Individual Life. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, Individual Life earnings were $168 million for the current quarter compared to $145 million a year ago. The $23 million increase was driven by a greater contribution from mortality experience. Claims experience was favorable both in the current quarter and the year-ago quarter. The contribution to current quarter results from mortality experience, together with recurring reserve updates, was about $40 million more favorable than our average expectations. Slide 15 shows Individual Life sales based on annualized new business premiums, which amounted to $97 million for the current quarter. This compares to sales of $165 million a year ago. The $68 million decrease was mainly driven by a $61 million decline in sales of guaranteed universal life insurance products, shown in the dark blue bars. This decline is directionally consistent with the recent trend we've seen across companies and distributors. The latest available data for the first half of the year shows a 40% decline in industry sales of guaranteed universal life from a year earlier. Our sales decrease also reflects actions we've taken to limit concentration in these products and maintain appropriate returns, including a series of price increases and actions taken by some competitors to enter the market or make their products relatively more attractive. Term insurance sales, in the light blue bars, were down $5 million from a year ago, reflecting price reductions by several competitors. In August, we implemented pricing changes on several of our guaranteed universal life and term insurance products, enhancing our competitive position where we see opportunities to offer attractive value propositions with appropriate expected returns. Since the underwriting and issue process typically takes up to 90 days from the time of a policy application, these repricings did not have a significant impact on our current quarter sales. Slide 16 highlights the Group Insurance business. After adjusting for reserve refinements reflecting our actuarial reviews, Group Insurance earnings amounted to $34 million in the current quarter compared to $23 million a year ago. The $11 million increase was driven by more favorable claims experience in Disability, partly offset by less favorable claims experience in Group Life. Slide 17 presents benefit ratios for Group Life and Group Disability. In Group Disability favorable current quarter claims experience, including development of existing cases and fewer new cases, drove an improvement of about 11 percentage points in the benefits ratio compared to the year-ago quarter, after removing the impact of the reserve refinements, as shown in the dark blue bars. While we've taken steps to improve results, experience will vary from one quarter to another and improvements won't be linear. On a similar adjusted basis, the Group Life benefits ratio was less favorable than a year ago, reflecting higher average claims size in the current quarter. Moving on to International Insurance, on Slide 18. This slide shows the results of our International Insurance business, adjusting for the refinements reflecting our actuarial reviews and the Star and Edison integration costs and Gibraltar Life a year ago. Slide 19 highlights our Life Planner operations. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, our Life Planner business reported earnings of $397 million for the quarter, down $8 million from a year ago. Higher expenses in the current quarter, including technology and distribution costs, more than offset the benefits of continued business growth and more favorable claims experience. Mortality was favorable in both the current quarter and the year-ago quarter, and we estimate that the contribution to current quarter results was about $20 million more favorable than our average expectations. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates, which reflect our hedging of yen income at JPY 82 this year versus JPY 80 last year, had a negative impact of $4 million on earnings in comparison to a year ago. We have completed the hedging of our expected yen earnings for 2015, and our hedging rate for next year will be JPY 91 per U.S. dollar. Slide 20 highlights Gibraltar Life and other operations. After adjusting for the items I mentioned, Gibraltar Life reported earnings of $446 million for the current quarter, down $24 million from a year ago. Policy benefits experience, including mortality and gains on surrenders, was less favorable in the current quarter than a year ago. And current quarter results reflected a higher level of expenses than the year-ago quarter, largely driven by technology costs. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact of $10 million on the comparison of results to a year ago. Turning to Slide 21. International Insurance sales on a constant-dollar basis were $743 million for the current quarter, an increase of $35 million or 5% from a year ago. Slide 21 is a product view of our sales. Our sales pattern has been affected by actions we've taken, including changes in our product lineup. In addition, the seasonal sales trend favors the first quarter for our Japanese Life Planner business and favors the second quarter for Gibraltar Life. Our yen-based single-premium bank channel product, shown in the brown bars, which we discontinued late last year after cumulative sales of more than $1 billion, contributed $49 million to sales at Gibraltar Life in the year-ago quarter. Excluding the discontinued product, International Insurance sales increased by $84 million from a year ago. Sales of annuities, substantially all of which are fixed annuities denominated in Australian and U.S. dollars, contributed $51 million of the increase, as you can see in the gold bars. These products, which have been popular among Gibraltar's customers, are repriced every 2 weeks for new business to stay in sync with current interest rates and account value adjustments apply, in the event of surrender, to reflect interest rate changes after the sale. The remainder of the sales increase came from $25 million greater sales of U.S. dollar-denominated whole life and retirement income products and $8 million of growth in sales for other products such as term insurance. Slide 22 breaks out Life Planner sales. Life Planner sales were $298 million in the current quarter, up $40 million or 16% from a year ago. Sales by our Life Planners in Japan were $192 million in the current quarter, up $15 million from a year ago. As shown in the gold bars, sales of U.S. dollar-denominated whole life and retirement income products increased by $10 million to $47 million for the current quarter. The remainder of the increase came from other products, shown in the dark blue bars, including term insurance. Sales outside of Japan, in the light blue bars, were up by $25 million from a year ago, mainly driven by increases in Korea and Brazil. Slide 23 shows Gibraltar Life sales. Sales from Gibraltar Life were $445 million in the current quarter compared to $450 million a year ago. Sales by Life Consultants, in the dark blue bars, amounted to $196 million for the current quarter, essentially unchanged from a year ago. Productivity of our Life Consultants, measured by policy sold per agent per month, has essentially returned to the level we achieved prior to our acquisition of Star and Edison. This reflects the results of our implementation of minimum production requirements and other quality standards for the sales force that came to us with the acquisition. This increased productivity entirely offset a decline in the number of Life Consultants of about 700 or 7% over the past year. Sales through the bank channel, shown in the gold bars, amounted to $177 million for the current quarter, down by $23 million from a year ago. This decrease reflects the $49 million of sales of the discontinued single-premium product in the year-ago quarter that I mentioned earlier, partly offset by a $26 million increase in sales of other products, including fixed annuities and recurring premium whole life. Sales through independent agents, shown in the light blue bars, amounted to $72 million in the current quarter, up by $17 million from a year ago. The increase was driven mainly by greater sales of fixed annuities and Death Protection products. Slide 24 shows the results of Corporate and Other operations. After adjusting for a charge in the current quarter to strengthen our reserves for obligations to pre-demutualization policyholders, Corporate and Other operations reported a loss of $320 million for the current quarter compared to a $312 million loss a year ago. The increase in the loss reflects higher net expenses in the current quarter, including the impact of a lower pension credit. Now I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon. Robert Michael Falzon : Thanks, Mark. I'm going to give you an update on some key items under the heading of Financial Strength and Flexibility starting with Slide 25. We continue to manage our insurance companies to levels of capital that we believe are consistent with AA standards. At the end of last year, Prudential Insurance reported an RBC ratio of 456%, with total adjusted capital, or TAC, of $13.9 billion. While we don't perform a quarterly bottoms-up RBC calculation, we estimate that our RBC ratio continues to be well above our 400% target after giving effect to results for the first 9 months of the year. In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margins of 835% and 967%, respectively, as of June 30. These reported solvency margins are also well above our targets. Looking at the overall capital position for the Financial Services businesses on Slide 26. We calculate our balance sheet capital capacity by comparing the statutory capital position of Prudential Insurance [Technical Difficulty] Robert Michael Falzon : This is Rob Falzon. I'm going to continue on. We apologize for having a modest problem with our system. I think where I left off before it cut off, we were turning to Slide 26 after having covered the solvency margins for our Japan businesses. So looking at the overall capital position for the Financial Services businesses, on Slide 26, we calculate our on-balance sheet capital capacity by comparing the statutory capital position of Prudential Insurance to our 400% RBC ratio target and then add capital capacity held at the parent company and other subsidiaries. At the end of last year, we estimated that our on-balance sheet capital capacity was about $3.5 billion, including about $1.5 billion that we considered readily deployable. During the first 9 months of this year, we returned about $1.5 billion to shareholders. These returns came in the form of 3 quarterly common stock dividends of $0.53 each per share in each quarter, for a total of about $740 million and the repurchase of $750 million of our common stock. This includes $250 million of repurchases during the third quarter under the $1 billion June board authorization, which extends through June 30 of next year. Net of these returns of capital, our available on-balance sheet capital capacity was about $5 billion, before funding of our investment in AFP Habitat in Chile, which we expect to close in the first half of 2015, with the purchase price of $530 million to $620 million. We will consider about $1.5 billion of our capital capacity to be readily deployable. Turning to the cash position at the parent company. Cash and short-term investments, net of outstanding commercial paper, amounted to $4 billion as of the end of the third quarter. This reflects senior debt issuances of $600 million during the quarter. The cash in excess of our targeted $1.3 billion liquidity cushion is available to repay maturing operating debt, to fund operating needs and to redeploy over time for strategic and capital management purposes. Now I'll turn it back over to John. John Robert Strangfeld : Thank you, Rob. Thank you, Mark. And we'd like to now open it up for questions. Operator : And you're ready for questions? John Robert Strangfeld : Yes, we are. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll first go to the line of Nigel Dally with Morgan Stanley. Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : With the annuities and the change in lapse assumptions, some other companies are also talking about utilization as being an offset. Interested whether you've recalibrated your utilization assumptions there as well. Robert Michael Falzon : Nigel, it's Rob Falzon. We actually looked at all of the assumptions that went into that calculation, so utilization, efficiency, et cetera, were included in that. The primary driver, however, to the assumption update was lapse and the lapse sensitivity to interest rates. Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. Then a second question on Asset Management. If we exclude out the other related revenues, seems like the core ROE came down pretty meaningfully this quarter. Seemed like it was on meaningfully higher expenses, so just hoping to get some additional color as to what's happening there. Stephen P. Pelletier: Nigel, this is Steve. Our growth in fees was commensurate with the growth in assets, but we did have growth in expenses, as you note. Some of that was onetime in nature, but the remainder of it reflected our continued investment in the long-term growth of the business. Operator : Next we'll go to the line of Tom Gallagher with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : The first question I had is just on the Group Disability reserve charge of around $100 million. You -- Mark, you had referenced Social Security offsets. Can you give a little more color for what's going on there? Are they getting harder to come by now? Is something changed with the Social Security offsets? Stephen P. Pelletier: Tom, this is Steve. I'll address your question. This does not reflect a change in the external environment, external to ourselves, regarding this. We have refined our methodology about assessing the probability that a certain segment of our claimants will receive Social Security disability, and the reserve strengthening that we did this quarter reflects that refund. Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : So -- but you haven't seen any change in behavior, nor amount of Social Security offsets. It's more assessing future probabilities going lower, I assume? Stephen P. Pelletier: That's correct. It's a refinement in our own methodologies around that. Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. And then related to the VA charge, was there a statutory earnings impact? And I believe last year, when you did this, there was a statutory earnings impact, but there wasn't a capital impact. Can you comment on those 2 issues? Robert Michael Falzon : Tom, it's Rob Falzon. So yes, recall that from a statutory standpoint, we used a modified GAAP accounting that defines our hedge targets. So yes, there was a statutory impact. Yes, it also had a capital consequence associated with it. However, the numbers that we've quoted you with regard to our total capital capacity and readily deployable, factor that in and so they're after the effects of the capital impact. Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : And so, Rob, would that have included -- so would that have been resources that were available within PRU global funding? Or how was that funded? Robert Michael Falzon : The -- we have resources across the firm, so it was a combination of capacity that we had within the annuities -- legal entity businesses to absorb that, in addition to funding that we've provided from other parts of the organization. Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. And just one last one, if I could sneak it in. The Retirement business, I guess, the results had been quite strong in the first part of the year, got a little bit weaker this quarter, and I believe it was underwriting-related. Is 10% to 15% quarterly swings in earnings volatility due to underwriting something we should expect going forward? Or was there something unusual about this quarter? Stephen P. Pelletier: Tom, it's Steve. I'll address your question. I wouldn't draw long-term expectations around this quarter. Our first and second quarter case experience was very, very strong relative to our assumptions and expectations. Our third quarter experience was also positive relative to our expectations, but not to the same extent as we saw in the first and second quarter, and that's really about the extent of it. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Erik Bass with Citigroup. Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : I was hoping you could discuss competition for the jumbo PRT deals and current pricing in the market, in particular, given Motorola's comments about paying no premium. It would just be helpful to get your perspective on if and how the economics have changed and why you're comfortable that these blocks are -- will generate attractive returns. Stephen P. Pelletier: Erik, it's Steve. I'll address your question. First of all, just to emphasize a point John made in his opening remarks, and that is that we're very pleased with the returns on the business we've written this year. Those returns are thoroughly consistent with our corporate return objectives. Second, the statements that you're referencing about par or above par or at par, those comments are all in relation to a plan sponsor's GAAP valuation of its pension liability. From one plan sponsor to another, those valuations can be impacted by a whole range of factors, including, in particular, whether a given plan sponsor is using old or new mortality tables in its valuation of the liability. Frankly, that's all pretty much irrelevant to us. We use a consistent and very disciplined methodology with multiple layers of oversight in order to arrive at our customized view, from the ground up, of the economic risks that we're taking on in a given transaction. That view is based on information that ranges far beyond the Society of Actuaries mortality tables. It includes industry data, it includes our own extensive experience in managing mortality risk, and it includes the -- especially in the large case market, the extensive census data that a plan sponsor supplies us on their retirees. So we're very, very confident in the approach that we take in that regard. Finally, I'd make some remarks regarding the different role that price plays in different segments of the market, and this reflects certainly our own competitive experience, but also the input that we've consistently received from plan sponsors and their advisors. In the large case market, price certainly matters, and there's a need to be competitive on pricing. In particular, pricing serves as a factor in winnowing down the competitive universe from the initial list to a very short list of finalists. We find that pricing, among those finalists, is typically within a very narrow band and that the plan sponsor's choice are based on assessment of certain critical factors that John mentioned in his opening comments. The ability of an insurer to execute large and complex transactions and to bring them to a successful and timely close and the ability to on-board literally tens of thousands of retirees in a seamless way that provides them a quality client experience. We have an established track record in this regard, and that gives plan sponsors a lot of confidence. The small market, and here I'm talking about a few hundred million and below, is very different. It is a market in which the business process really is that of a price-based option. And so when we back up and look at our experience, we're writing relatively more than our fair share of business in the large case market where these capabilities and our ability to differentiate ourselves comes into play in the eyes of plan sponsors, and we're writing, if you will, less than our fair share of business in the segment of the market that tends to be all about price. Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : That's very helpful. And how should we think about interest risk related to these transactions? And you're doing retiree blocks, so are you able to pretty tightly match the assets and liabilities? Stephen P. Pelletier: Yes, that's a real good point, Erik. The -- very often, the point about retirees is, obviously, seen as a mitigator as it relates to longevity risk, but it's also a significant mitigator in relation to interest rate risk. These are people who are already drawing their payments. The payment schedule is set. There's no more optionality or behavioral risk in these cash flows, and we're able to match them very closely. Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Got it. And how much risk is there if rates move between when a transaction is announced and when it's closed? Stephen P. Pelletier: We have contractual provisions to adjust closing pricing for rate movements between announcement and closing. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Nadel with Sterne Agee. John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : I've a question about the assumption review and especially around the Individual Life insurance business, how you change the long-term path for investment yields there in your current view versus your former view. And I guess, specifically, does that have any influence on your view of the return potential for the Hartford Life block? Robert Michael Falzon : John, it's Rob Falzon. So we actually only made a relatively modest change to our long-term view of interest rates. So prior to the current quarter, using the 10-year as a benchmark, we had set that at 4.65%. We brought that down to 4.5%, and then a corresponding adjustment to the rest of the yield curve. The only other adjustment that was made is the method through which we migrate to that long-term reversion rate was modified, where we use the forward curve now for a 2-year period and then linearly move out of the long-term assumption for the remaining 8 years. That in and of itself is a relatively modest change and would not otherwise alter the view that we would have with respect to the economics on the Hartford transaction or, in any material way, our other blocks. John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Terrific. And then just a question on G&A overall, general and administrative expenses overall for the company. I think you mentioned in a couple of occasion -- a couple of segments that expense levels were a little bit elevated in the current quarter. Is there any reason we should expect that -- in those couple of instances, Life Planner, a few other places, should we trend from this level? Or is some of that IT spending and other spending one-off? Robert Michael Falzon : So John, in the -- we have not called out to the -- to you or to anyone, any normalization of the expenses that we had in the current quarter with respect to any of the businesses on an overall basis. So I think that's the best way that I can answer that question. John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then lastly, just on the Chilean partnership. When you fund that sometime in the first half of 2015, where do you expect that funding will come from? Will it come from the parent? Or will it come from one of the international operating subsidiaries? And should we expect that, that funding -- we should reduce the expectation for buybacks by a like amount, like you did when you did Hartford? Robert Michael Falzon : Yes. So the overall level of funding for this, recall that the transaction will be somewhere around $600 million. So it's a relatively modest-sized transaction, and it will be closing during the course of the first half of next year. We have adequate, readily deployable capital, as we've articulated. In order to complete that acquisition, and absent any other events, funding for this would not alter any existing capital redeployment plans that we would have. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : So the first question just related to the previous one on, given the Chilean deal, but also more importantly, the number of pension closeout and longevity transactions you've announced recently. Should we assume that you would be less proactive on share buybacks going forward than you have been because you're using a lot of capital in those deals? And then, secondly, you've spoken about this a couple of times in your prepared remarks. But on the pension closeout deal, you won a disproportionate share of the deals that have been done in the large case market. So just wondering, what's allowing you to win these deals other than the price? And how, like what -- maybe if you could just give us a little bit more detail on what type of returns that you're earning on these and like you've said consistent with your long-term objectives, wondering if you could just talk a little bit more specific on the type of returns you're assuming and what you're earning on the deals that you've done over the past couple of years? Robert Michael Falzon : Jimmy, it's Rob. I'll handle the first part of your question, and I'm going to turn it over to Steve for the second part of your question. I think it almost repeat what I said just prior to your question. We would -- both in terms of when we got the authorization for our stock buyback program back in June for the $1 billion and then with respect to how we're thinking about Habitat, all of that considered our expectations with regard to our ability to fund our continuing business, including our PRT business. And neither of those events, either our success with PRT or the Habitat acquisition, would cause us to otherwise think about altering the existing capital redeployment plans that we have. And then second part, I'll turn it over to Steve. Stephen P. Pelletier: Jimmy, this is Steve. I won't characterize our returns on the transactions beyond what I said, which is that, like you said, we like the returns on the business we've written. Those -- they're in line with our corporate return expectations. In regard to capabilities, I'd mention the comments that John made at the outset, which is these are capabilities we've been investing in since 2006 in terms of the dedicated team. Also, we have a proven methodology for taking the resources of that dedicated team and connecting them to our resources across the company that are involved in successful and timely execution of these deals. That would include our asset liability management, our investment management, our actuarial and our legal area as well, in our ability to execute documentation in a ready fashion. That is a path of certainty that we can offer plan sponsors from the very outset of these transactions. We're able to give them a calendar for how they should expect matters to progress along this path, and that is a calendar that we have consistently followed through on in the different transactions we've done, and that creates, like I say, kind of a virtuous cycle about plan sponsor confidence in our ability to execute on these transactions. Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : And I can understand you're not disclosing specifics on a certain deal, but I think one thing that might be helpful in the future is given that you've done a number of these now, that at least give us some idea on what actual returns have been because, whether it's right or wrong, given how many of these deals have been announced and what proportion of those you've earned, you've ended up getting -- there's a concern out there that may be Prudential's being aggressive on pricing. But that's for something for you to evaluate in the future. Mark B. Grier: Jimmy, it's Mark. Let me add 2 elements of color on this. One point is that the deals to date have outperformed our assumptions and expectations on both liabilities and assets. But secondly, I said early on in questions about these deals, particularly after we had just done GM and Verizon, that if these were done in a stand-alone company, you would want to buy that company, and I would stand by that comment. I believe that on a risk return basis, appropriately considering the entire deal and capitalization, these attractive are opportunities for us. Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And lastly, just on the Institutional Asset Management business. Your flows have been consistently positive for a number of years. This quarter, it was a negative. So just if you can give us a little bit of color and whether it's more of an aberration or is there something that's changed in terms of your performance or anything else that drove the results this quarter? Stephen P. Pelletier: No, Jimmy. This is Steve. I'd call it more of an aberration. It was driven by some rebalancing activities by equity clients and also the planned unwinding of an Asian real estate fund. When -- obviously, flows can be lumpy, and it's, of course, it's unfortunate to see a streak ending, but when we look at our investment performance, that continues to give us great confidence in our ability to garner flows in this business going forward. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets. Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division : I just have a couple of follow-ups. One is just on what Jimmy was asking about return expectations with the various pension closeout activities. Can you remind us of what your corporate return expectations are versus your cost of capital to maybe help triangulate the return question? Robert Michael Falzon : Randy, it's Rob Falzon. We have a stated target objective of 13% to 14%, and we think that, that provides a handsome premium over our cost of capital. Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division : Okay. And I think in the past when you've kind of identified businesses that are above or below that target to kind of average to the return, where would pension fall on that continuum, where Japan would be lower and then some of the annuity activities will be higher? Robert Michael Falzon : Yes, Randy, we don't... John Robert Strangfeld : Japan's higher. Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division : Say again? John Robert Strangfeld : Japan's a lot higher. Robert Michael Falzon : The actual returns that we post on our Japan business are actually with all -- well the risk would merit a lower hurdle rate. The actual returns against that have actually been well above what you would benchmark as a hurdle rate for that business. Having said that, Randy, we actually don't provide any visibility toward individual hurdle rates for any of our segment businesses. We just articulate that in the context of the overall company objectives because our mix of business and the capital that we deploy in it will change over time. Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division : Okay, understood. And then on the group charge and just kind of following up on the Social Security piece of that. I guess, a couple. One is do you have any sense that Prudential's book would have more Social Security reimbursement exposure than a normal book? And then on that charge, was it mostly due to the Social Security recoverability issue? Or was there another major piece of the charge in the group area? Stephen P. Pelletier: There's nothing -- Randy, this is Steve. There's nothing about our business that is materially different about the Social Security matter. As I said, this is a refinement of our own methodologies. The second part of your question was in regard to... Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division : Well I'm just trying to reconcile, I think intuitively, you're having good current year development or activity, as you stated. But -- so then I'm trying to reconcile that with this kind of -- these refinements, and so Social Security has come out as a piece of which it makes sense. Is there another big piece, and kind of how big of a piece of the charge was the Social Security item? Stephen P. Pelletier: We made an across-the-board update of our actuarial assumptions, and there were a variety of impacts, but the Social Security offset matter was the biggest piece. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Eric Berg with RBC Capital Markets. Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : I actually have just one question today. You've emphasized that the pension risk transfer business on one hand and the longevity reinsurance business on the other are really quite different from each other in terms of capital requirements, the profits that come out, the funding, one is funded, the other is not. Do you prefer one business over the other? Is one business a better business than the other? Stephen P. Pelletier: Eric, this is Steve. We view -- well, first of all, we view this as a business, and we see longevity reinsurance and funded pension risk transfer business as different parts of that business. We view these as actually highly, highly complementary to each other. They are complementary to each other in terms of the capabilities that we were speaking about earlier. The insights we garner from one part of the business can help inform our risk management and our pricing in another part of the business. And we also see them as highly complementary from a financial result standpoint. Pension risk transfer business, funded pension risk transfer business, our earnings tend to decay gradually over time as the book runs off. Longevity reinsurance, the earnings profile actually escalates over time as our actuarial certainty about outcomes progresses as time elapses. So I'd say both from a strategic and from a financial standpoint, they're highly complementary. Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : If I could just ask one quick follow-up. Is there any reason, as an industrial company or another old-line industrial company or another plan sponsor, I realize you have newer companies with defined benefits plans, so lets' just talk about a plan sponsor in general. As a plan sponsor thinks about sort of getting out of the pension business or reducing its exposure to pension, what sort of considerations would prompt it to choose one approach over the other? Mark B. Grier: Meaning funded versus longevity swap? Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Yes, please. Stephen P. Pelletier: I think, Eric, we find that at least to date, in the U.S. market, the funded business has been the primary of choice. Whereas in the U.K., and also starting to extend into other markets like Canada and the Netherlands, we see the longevity reinsurance market as being, at this stage, much more highly developed and that's the way a lot of companies choose to go. But that could emerge in the U.S. market as well. But right now, we see the differentiation as largely a geographical one. Operator : And that will be from the line of Steven Schwartz with Raymond James. Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : I wanted to follow up on the Social Security issue first, and I just want to make sure I understand this. From the initial comments, it sounded to me like it was one part of the business that was affected by the Social Security refinement. Is that accurate? Stephen P. Pelletier: Yes. It's our Group Insurance Disability business. Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : No, no, no. I meant like one cohort or one type of risk or something like that? Or it was just more general? Stephen P. Pelletier: No. We refined our methodologies in how we assess the likelihood of claimants to receive Social Security disability, especially around our segmentation of claimants. Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Well, that's what I meant, the segmentation of claimants. So that's somehow -- but it wasn't necessarily one or the other. That's what I was trying to get to. What that means -- what does that mean, segmentation of claimants? Stephen P. Pelletier: That means we refined the extent to which -- how we vary our assessment of probability from one segment to the next. A much more granular approach. Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay. All right, that's what I want to get to, okay. And then if we could stick on the actuarial stuff. With regards to the change in lapse assumptions on the variable annuities, what was it about interest rates? I mean, I would think that lower interest rates, older people, obviously, they've got nowhere to go. They would stick with their policies, but that's not what you're talking about here, is it? Stephen P. Pelletier: No, Steven, this is Steve again. We changed our approach quite significantly this year to a much more sophisticated approach towards lapsation. Previously, our approach had been fundamentally based on \"In-the-Moneyness\" of the guarantee, and that's kind of an industry standard approach. Now we're focusing on the ability of a policyholder to replicate the income stream from our guarantee through other sources, other sources that might be available in the marketplace. As such, that makes this approach much more sense -- so that makes our lapse assumptions under this approach much more sensitive to interest rate movements.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mark Finkelstein. Please go ahead. Mark Finkelstein : Thank you, Cynthia. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today's call are John Strangfeld, CEO; Mark Grier, Vice Chairman; Charlie Lowrey, Head of International Businesses; Steve Pelletier, Head of Domestic Businesses; Rob Falzon, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by John, Mark and Rob, and then we will answer your questions. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures.

John, I'll hand it over to you. John Robert Strangfeld : Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our fourth quarter results were a little lighter than the other quarters of the year partly due to seasonality. But overall, we feel very good about 2014. More specifically, operating -- adjusted operating income, excluding market-driven and discrete items, was $9.84 per share for the full year 2014, which is an increase of 10% over 2013 and exceeded the expectation we established in guidance. Likewise, our ROE for the year exceeded our 13% to 14% long-term target range. Results benefited from tailwinds such as strong non-coupon investment income, favorable equity markets and better-than-expected underwriting experience. Nonetheless, we are pleased with the positioning of our businesses and the prospects going forward, and would like to highlight just a few. Our annuity business benefited from favorable equity markets that contributed to 15% adjusted operating income growth, excluding market-driven and discrete items in 2014. Additionally, we are pleased that our newer products like Prudential Defined Income, which isn't equity-centric, are gaining traction and collectively represent over 20% of total annuity sales in the second half of 2014. Retirement had a record earnings year, with strong momentum in pension risk transfer. We originated over $37 billion in total buyout and longevity account values in 2014, including the landmark $27 billion British Telecom longevity transaction. Asset Management reported $5.4 billion in positive unaffiliated third-party net flows in 2014. And assets under management grew 8% over year end 2013. While net flows in the second half of the year were less robust, solid underlying investment performance and business momentum keeps us optimistic that this will continue to be a good story going forward. Individual Life sales improved sequentially in the fourth quarter following selective product repricing in August, and we like our competitive positioning and business mix. We've also benefited from favorable mortality in 9 out of the last 10 quarters. The Group Insurance business continues to benefit from repricing actions, better underwriting discipline and improved claim handling processes. And while we're not ready to declare victory yet, our underwriting trends are certainly moving in the right direction. Our International businesses continue to perform well. Life Planner net premiums policy charges and fees grew a little over 6% on a constant-currency basis in 2014, and we continue to grow our Life Planner count while maintaining high standards. Gibraltar Life Consultant productivity has returned to levels last seen prior to the Star/Edison acquisition. We are also now showing signs of stabilization in the Life Consultant count after raising productivity standards. Additionally, we have shown progress in growing our independent agency channel and improving our mix of businesses in the bank channel. Capital management was also a key theme in 2014. We paid $1 billion in common stock dividends and repurchased $1 billion of our shares. We also look forward to the closing of our transaction with ILC to acquire an ownership stake in AFP Habitat, a leading Chilean retirement services provider, following our signing of the memorandum of understanding in late 2014. In addition, our restructuring of the Closed Block business to repurchase the Class B shares and redeem the IHC debt simplifies our operating structure and added financial flexibility. And while the size of our below-the-line charges during the year was disappointing, we maintained a strong capital level and good balance sheet flexibility. Rob Falzon will discuss our capital strength in more detail in a few minutes. As we look forward, we cannot assume the same tailwinds that we benefited from in 2014 will recur, and we're mindful of the need to navigate more challenging headwinds like the weaker yen, and if early 2015 is any indication, potentially lower-than-expected interest rates, as examples. Nonetheless, our diversified portfolio of high-quality businesses, our strategic positioning and the quality of our talent keeps us optimistic that we will maintain a top-tier return on equity and create strong value for our shareholders. With that, I'll hand it over to Mark. Mark B. Grier: Thank you, John. Good morning, good afternoon, good evening. Thank you all for joining our call today. I'll take you through our results, and then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon, who will cover our capital and liquidity picture. Before I discuss our results, though, I would like to provide some context around the comments that Rob will make about capital. First, I want to make the point that total debt in the company has been coming down, as we have intended. However, lower interest rates have resulted in an increase in the amount of debt that we characterize as capital. This is a familiar concept to those of you who have followed us closely over time. Second, our stated capital capacity of $2 billion reflects the impact on capital of repaying about $2 billion in capital debt, which we haven't done. In the past, we would not have earmarked a portion of capital to repay debt. And compared to the way in which we would have portrayed capital capacity in the past, our current number would be about $4 billion. We believe that this is a responsible way to describe capital capacity, understanding that any capital statements necessarily are influenced by underlying assumptions. Third, the gain on our yen capital hedges of $2.4 billion is not reflected in our capital numbers and represents a substantial offset to other market-driven effects. We also generate a lot of capital in our businesses, 60% of operating earnings over time. And we are very comfortable with our financial strength, capital position and our capital plans. Turning now to operating results. I'll start with an overview of our financial results for the quarter, shown on Slide 2. On a reported basis, common stock earnings per share amounted to $2.12 for the fourth quarter based on after-tax adjusted operating income of the Financial Services businesses. This compares to EPS of $2.20 a year ago. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items in both the current quarter and the year-ago quarter, EPS was up 5%, amounting to $2.33 compared to $2.22. Looking across our businesses, here are some key drivers of this comparison. We benefited from higher fees reflecting growth in account values in our Annuities business, greater assets under management in our asset management business and the contribution of recent longevity reinsurance transactions in Retirement. And our international insurance businesses benefited from continued business growth and more favorable policy benefits experience, including mortality and currency-driven surrenders of fixed annuities. These benefits were partly offset by a lower contribution in Asset Management from incentive, transaction and strategic investing activities, in comparison to strong year-ago quarter results, driven largely by changing valuations and the timing of performance-based fees, higher expenses, including technology costs in several of our businesses, and less favorable foreign currency exchange rates in international insurance. On a GAAP basis, we reported a net loss of $1.2 billion for the current quarter. This reflects the impact of a $2.4 billion pretax loss or about $1.6 billion on an after-tax basis from foreign currency exchange rate remeasurement driven by the weakening of the Japanese yen. This remeasurement impact was largely offset by corresponding adjustments to asset values that are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, which is outside of net income or loss. As we mentioned in our earnings guidance call in December, we've implemented a new reporting structure in Japan that will largely mitigate the impact of these currency exchange rate changes on net income or loss, beginning with the first quarter 2015 reporting. Also commencing this year, we are moving up our annual actuarial assumption review to the second quarter. Slide 3 shows our full year results. Earnings per share for the year, based on after-tax adjusted operating income, amounted to $9.84 after adjusting for market-driven and discrete items. This represents an increase of 10% from 2013, driven by solid underlying performance across our businesses, with tailwinds from equity markets, non-coupon investment returns and underwriting experience. These earnings produced an ROE of 15.8% for the year, after adjusting for foreign currency remeasurement, which benefited our reported ROE by reducing the denominator. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, and after adjusting the numbers to remove the impact of foreign currency remeasurement, amounted to $64.75 at year end, up $4.76 from a year ago after the payment of 4 quarterly dividends totaling $2.17 per share. Turning to Slide 4. Slide 4 shows a rundown of market-driven and discrete items included in our results for the quarter. In the Annuities business, the decline in market interest rates and less favorable performance of separate account funds relative to our expectations caused us to strengthen reserves for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits and adjust DAC, resulting in a net charge of $0.10 per share. Reserve refinements in Retirement, Individual Life and International Insurance resulted in a net charge of $0.10 per share. The most significant items in the current quarter were reserve increases in International Insurance, mainly driven by a calculation update relating to higher premium-rated underwriting classes, and a reserve release in Retirement based on updated census data on annuitants in a legacy group annuity contract. In addition, in Individual Life, we absorbed integration costs of about $0.01 per share related to the Hartford Life acquisition. In total, the items I just mentioned had a net unfavorable impact of $0.21 per share on fourth quarter results. During the year-ago quarter, market-driven and discrete items produced a net charge of $0.02 per share. Moving to Slide 5. On a GAAP basis, our net loss of $1.2 billion in the current quarter includes amounts characterized as net realized investment losses of $2.7 billion on a pretax basis, comprised of the items you see on this slide. Foreign currency remeasurement resulted in a pretax loss of $2.4 billion for the current quarter, as I mentioned earlier. Product-related embedded derivatives and hedging activity had a negative impact of $799 million, largely driven by the decline in interest rates during the quarter. This was partly offset by $479 million of positive mark-to-market on derivatives mainly related to the management of asset and liability durations, also largely driven by interest rates. Impairments and credit losses on investments were $16 million for the quarter, and general portfolio activities resulted in net pretax gains of $66 million. Moving to our business results, starting on Slide 6. I'll discuss the comparative results excluding the market-driven and discrete items that I have mentioned. Slide 6 shows our U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management businesses. Slide 7 highlights Individual Annuities. Annuities results were $390 million for the quarter, up $6 million from a year ago. Slide 8 gives a view of growth in account values, fees and earnings. Most of our operating earnings in the Annuities business come from base contract charges linked to daily account values. Policy charges and fee income increased 5% from a year ago, essentially keeping pace with the increase in average account values. However, lower spreads on general account balances and slightly higher expenses in the current quarter partly offset the benefit of growth in fees. As a result, return on assets, or ROA, slipped a few basis points from the year-ago quarter. Slide 9 covers our Annuities sales. Our gross Annuities sales for the quarter were $2.4 billion, essentially unchanged from a year ago. Our Annuities sales have been fairly consistent over the past year, both on a gross and net basis. We've taken steps to diversify the risk exposures associated with our product guarantees to maintain appropriate pricing and return expectations under changing market conditions and to more broadly meet the needs of the retirement market. Taking a look at our annual gross sales, you can see how product diversification has affected our mix. A year ago, 84% of our overall sales represented our highest daily, or HDI, guaranteed lifetime income withdrawal product. The remainder of our sales consisted mainly of variable annuities where the customer did not elect the living benefit rider. We updated our HDI product in February 2014. A key feature of the updated product allows us to change key pricing elements as often as monthly for new business. Our most recent pricing reset was a few weeks ago, with a lower payout rate for certain key age bands. The 70% contribution to 2014 sales from HDI reflects our product diversification. Our Prudential Defined Income, or PDI, product contributed about 20% of our 2014 sales compared to less than 10% of sales a year earlier. PDI directs a client's entire investment to a separate account fixed income portfolio that we manage. The product provides a guaranteed lifetime income based on the client's age at the time of purchase and the premium paid with a roll-up provision. Similarly to our current HDI product, the design of PDI allows us to adjust key pricing features as often as monthly for new business. The remainder of our 2014 sales represents annuities without living benefit guarantee. This includes about $130 million of sales of our recently introduced Prudential Premier Investment Variable Annuity, which does not offer living benefit guarantees and unbundles guaranteed minimum death benefits as an optional add-on. We've begun to gain shelf space for this product, and we believe it offers an appealing value proposition to those clients mainly focused on tax-deferred asset growth potential. Slide 10 highlights the Retirement business. Earnings for the Retirement business amounted to $294 million for the current quarter, essentially unchanged from a year ago. Current quarter results benefited from higher fees, reflecting the longevity reinsurance transactions that we closed in the second half of the year. The benefit was largely offset by a lower contribution from net investment results. Current quarter results benefited from about $30 million of income, above our average expectations on non-coupon investments, and about $40 million of mortgage loan prepayment income, which is well above our average expectations. These 2 contributors totaled about $70 million, roughly $20 million more than our non-coupon income above average expectations a year ago. However, the net positive variance was more than offset by lower fixed income returns. Turning to Slide 11. Total retirement gross deposits and sales were $14.2 billion for the current quarter compared to $9.9 billion a year ago. Stand-alone institutional gross sales were about $8.5 billion in the current quarter compared to roughly $4 billion a year ago. Current quarter sales included 2 significant funded pension risk transfer transactions totaling $4.6 billion and 2 longevity reinsurance transactions totaling $2.7 billion. Excluding these pension risk transfer cases, institutional stand-alone sales were about $1 billion for the current quarter, compared to roughly $4 billion a year ago, mainly reflecting lower sales of stable value wrap products. Institutional stand-alone net flows for the quarter were $3.7 billion. Outflows of about $2.7 billion of stable value wrap business and roughly $1 billion of ongoing attrition of our jumbo pension risk transfer and longevity reinsurance cases together with runoff of other legacy business partly offset our new sales during the quarter. Full Service gross deposits and sales, shown in the dark blue bars, were $5.6 billion for the quarter, essentially unchanged from a year ago. Net outflows of about $700 million for the quarter reflected a lapse of a lower fee administrative services-only case of $950 million. Total Retirement account values amounted to $364 billion at year end, up $41 billion from a year earlier. Slide 12 highlights the Asset Management business. The Asset Management business reported adjusted operating income of $192 million for the current quarter compared to $209 million a year ago. While most of the segment's results came from asset management fees, the decrease from a year ago was driven by a $32 million lower contribution from incentive, transaction, strategic investing and commercial mortgage activities. This contribution, which amounted to $25 million for the current quarter, is inherently variable since it reflects changing valuations and the timing of transactions. Excluding results from other related revenues, Asset Management earnings were up by $15 million from a year ago, largely as a result of higher asset management fees, driven by growth in assets under management. The segment's assets under management amounted to $934 billion at year end, including $450 billion managed for unaffiliated institutional and retail clients. Third-party assets under management increased $35 billion from a year ago, driven by market appreciation along with about $5 billion of net flows over the past year. Net institutional outflows of $2.5 billion in the current quarter were driven by equities and included some client rebalancing of portfolios to reduce the weighting of some domestic equity product classes. These outflows were essentially offset by net retail inflows of $2.6 billion. Slide 13 shows the results of our U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance businesses. Slide 14 highlights Individual Life. Individual Life earnings were $135 million for the current quarter compared to $165 million a year ago. The decrease reflected higher net charges in the current quarter for amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and related items, driven by the ongoing impact of our annual actuarial review in the third quarter and by financial market performance in relation to our assumptions, including the interest rate decline in the current quarter. In addition, current quarter expenses were above the level of a year ago, reflecting nonlinear items such as distribution costs and consulting. Claims experience was favorable both in the current quarter and the year-ago quarter. Putting it all together, we estimate that in comparison to our average expectations, claims experience, expenses and amortization had a net favorable impact of about $5 million on current quarter results. Slide 15 shows Individual Life sales based on annualized new business premiums, which amounted to $130 million for the current quarter. This compares to sales of $166 million a year ago. The $36 million decrease was driven by lower sales of guaranteed universal life insurance products, shown in the dark blue bars. This decline reflects actions we've taken to limit concentration in these products and maintain appropriate returns, including a series of price increases, which contributed to the significant drop in sales that you see in the early part of the year. In August, we implemented pricing changes on several of our guaranteed universal life and term insurance products, enhancing our competitive position where we see opportunities to offer attractive value propositions with appropriate expected returns. These pricing changes contributed to a sequential quarter increase in sales of these products, which contributed a total of $92 million to current quarter sales compared to $74 million in the third quarter of this year. Slide 16 highlights the Group Insurance business. Group Insurance earnings amounted to $44 million in the current quarter compared to $58 million a year ago. While we would consider our underwriting experience to be favorable in the current period, we had particularly favorable group life experience last year and high recurring period expenses that drove the negative year-over-year variance. Slide 17 presents our earnings trend for Group Insurance and benefit ratios for Group Life and Group Disability. In Group Disability, favorable current quarter experience, driven by claims resolution and fewer new claims, produced a 79.1% benefits ratio, the lowest of the past 5 years. While we've taken steps to improve results, we continue to expect that claims experience will vary from one quarter to another. The Group Life benefits ratio, while less favorable than a year ago, was at the low end of our expected range. Moving to International Insurance on Slide 18. This slide shows the results of our International Insurance businesses. Slide 19 highlights our Life Planner operations. Our Life Planner business reported earnings of $382 million for the quarter, essentially unchanged from a year ago. Mortality was more favorable than a year ago, and we estimate that the contribution to current quarter results was about $25 million greater than our average expectations. Results also benefited from continued business growth with insurance revenues, including premiums, policy charges and fees, up 8% from a year ago on a constant-dollar basis. The benefits to results from more favorable mortality and continued business growth were essentially offset by higher expenses driven by a range of items, including nondeferrable distribution costs reflecting higher sales, technology costs and sundry items such as annual true-ups of employee benefit plan liabilities. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates, which reflect our hedging of yen income at JPY 82 in 2014 versus JPY 80 a year earlier, had a negative impact of $3 million on earnings in comparison to a year ago. Slide 20 highlights Gibraltar Life and other operations. Gibraltar Life reported earnings of $385 million for the current quarter compared to $378 million a year ago. The current quarter benefited from a greater contribution from net investment results than a year ago, which was largely driven by portfolio growth. Results from non-coupon investments were roughly in line with the year-ago quarter. Policy benefits experience, including mortality and gains on surrenders, was also more favorable than a year ago. We estimate that the contribution of this experience to current quarter results was about $20 million greater than our average expectation. The greater contributions to earnings from net investment results and policy benefits experience were partly offset by higher expenses in the current quarter. Like the Life Planner operations, the higher expense level was also driven by a variety of items, including technology costs. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact of $9 million in the comparison of results to a year ago. Turning to Slide 21. Overall, International Insurance sales on a constant-dollar basis were $724 million for the current quarter, up $20 million from a year ago. Slide 21 is a product view of our sales. As you can see in the dark blue bars, Death Protection products remain our major emphasis and contributed about 60% of current quarter sales, with an increase of $47 million from the year-ago quarter driven by products such as term insurance. This was partly offset by lower sales of Retirement products, which comprised less than 20% of current quarter sales. Slide 22 breaks out Life Planner sales. Life Planner sales were $311 million in the current quarter, up $13 million or 4% from a year ago. Sales by our Life Planners in Japan were $189 million in the current quarter compared to $196 million a year ago. As shown in the gold bars, sales of Retirement products decreased by $36 million to $56 million for the current quarter, reflecting a change in commission rates. This decrease was largely offset by an increase of Death Protection product sales, shown in the dark blue bars, including term insurance, which also reflected a change in commission rates. Sales outside of Japan, in the brown bars, were up by $20 million from a year ago, mainly driven by increases in Korea and Brazil. Slide 23 shows Gibraltar Life sales. Sales from Gibraltar Life were $413 million in the current quarter compared to $406 million a year ago. Sales by Life Consultants, in the dark blue bars, amounted to $179 million for the current quarter, essentially unchanged from a year ago. Our Life Consultant count stood at about 8,700 at year end, down about 600 or 7% from a year earlier, reflecting our active management of the sales force that came to us with the acquisitions of Star and Edison, including minimum production requirements. The decline in count was offset in the quarterly sales comparison by greater productivity, measured by policies sold per agent per month, which has returned to the level that we achieved prior to the acquisitions. The Life Consultant count has begun to stabilize, as you can see in the sequential quarter trend. Sales through the bank channel, shown in the gold bars, amounted to $166 million for the current quarter, down $7 million from a year ago. This decrease reflects $22 million of residual sales in the year-ago quarter of a yen-based, single-premium whole life product that we discontinued. Sales of other products in the bank channel were up $15 million or 10%, with the growth mainly driven by sales of fixed annuities. About 2/3 of our current quarter sales in the bank channel are the Death Protection products we emphasize, mainly recurring premium whole life. Sales through independent agents, shown in the light blue bars, amounted to $68 million in the current quarter, up $11 million from a year ago. While Death Protection and Retirement products comprise the majority of sales through this channel, the year-over-year increase was driven mainly by greater sales of fixed annuities. Slide 24 shows the results of Corporate and Other operations. Corporate and Other operations reported a loss of $326 million for the current quarter compared to a $397 million loss a year ago. The reduction in the loss reflects lower expenses in the current quarter, driven by a variety of nonlinear items such as employee compensation and benefit costs and charitable contributions. Now I'll turn it over to Rob. Robert Michael Falzon : Thanks, Mark. I'm going to provide an update on some key items under the heading of Financial Strength and Flexibility, starting on Slide 25. We continue to manage our insurance companies to levels of capital that we believe are consistent with AA standards. For Prudential Insurance, we manage to a 400% RBC ratio. While statutory results for 2014 are not yet final, we estimate that RBC for Prudential Insurance as of year end 2014 will be above 400%, consistent with the estimate that we provided in December. This year-end RBC position reflects a $2 billion dividend from Prudential Insurance to the parent company in December, which we applied toward the redemption of our IHC debt and the Class B Stock. In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margins of 858% and 931%, as of their most recent reporting date, September 30, 2014. These are comfortably above our 600% to 700% targets. And we expect that our Japanese companies will continue to report strong solvency margins relative to their targets as of their end of current fiscal years, which ends in March 31, 2015. Looking at our overall capital position on Slide 26. We calculate our on-balance sheet capital capacity by comparing the statutory capital position of Prudential Insurance to our 400% RBC ratio target, and then add capital capacity held at the parent company and other subsidiaries. A year ago, our on-balance sheet capital capacity was roughly $3.5 billion, of which $1.5 billion was considered readily deployable. During the year, we declared 4 common stock dividends amounting to about $1 billion in total, including a dividend of $0.58 per share in the fourth quarter that represented a 9% increase and repurchased $1 billion of common stock, totaling about $2 billion of returns of capital. These capital uses were offset by capital generated within our businesses, primarily from operating earnings. In addition, our restructuring of the Closed Block business had the effect of reducing our total capital capacity, while increasing the amount we consider readily deployable by releasing trapped capital. As the available on-balance sheet capital capacity and readily deployable capital balances have now converged, providing 2 distinct capital figures has become less meaningful. Therefore, we will be providing a single capital capacity figure going forward. At year end 2014, we estimate our available on balance sheet capital capacity at $2 billion, with the vast majority of that amount considered readily deployable based on how we have defined that figure in the past. As described by Mark, our stated capital capacity is net of capital we anticipate using to pay down debt, calibrated to arrive at our long-term targeted financial leverage ratio of 25%. Absent such an assumption, our total capital capacity would be approximately $4 billion. Our on-balance sheet capital capacity is lower than the estimate for the year end 2014 that we provided in our 2015 guidance call in December. The variance is mainly due to the decline in interest rates that occurred in the fourth quarter, which had 2 primary impacts. First, we manage a portion of our variable annuity interest rate risk through a broader capital protection framework, which includes an underhedge position. As interest rates declined, a negative impact on the underhedge triggered a change in the required capital, causing a funding need that we satisfied with holding company resources. Secondly, the decline in interest rates through the quarter caused a higher statutory provision based on year-end asset adequacy testing. We evaluate our on-balance sheet capital amounts to set points in time. And therefore, it is not explicitly reduced by further capital commitments like our Chilean acquisition or increased for expected capital generation. However, based on what we know today, we expect to be able to fund our known or anticipated capital commitments with the capital we would expect to generate in our ongoing businesses. This includes generating deployable capital equal to about 60% of our operating earnings over time as well as other positive capital items, including settlements to PFI's -- settlements to PFI in 2015 on the $2.4 billion fair value of our Japan capital hedge. Turning to the cash position at the parent company. Cash and short-term investments, net of outstanding commercial paper, amounted to about $4.2 billion as of year end. The cash in excess of our targeted $1.3 billion liquidity cushion is available to repay maturing operating debt, to fund operating needs and to deploy, over time, for strategic and capital management purposes. Now I'll turn it back over to John. John Robert Strangfeld : Thank you, Rob. Thank you, Mark. I'd like to now open it up to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Erik Bass with Citi. Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : First just wanted to touch on the capital topics a little bit more. On -- I guess, if interest rates, given the decline we've seen post year end, should we expect further pressure from kind of the interest rate underhedge? And also, could you elaborate a little bit more on the comments you made about the year-end asset adequacy test strengthening and where that was? Robert Michael Falzon : Okay. So let me address first the sensitivity to further future declines. To state the obvious, further declines in interest rates are not helpful, but I would be careful not to extrapolate the fourth quarter sensitivities. There are a number of moving pieces beyond just rates that affect those items. And capital sensitivity is not by any means linear. Our assets and liabilities have convexity, and they are -- and the capital is significantly influenced by management actions that we take. Hence, it's why we actually don't provide sensitivities on capital in the same way that we did for you on AOI. We are continually evaluating our overall sensitivity to markets generally and to interest rates' movements both up and down specifically to assess our exposure. We modulate shocks to the current environment. We look at the accounting, capital and economic exposures to both moderate and severe shocks, up and down. And we assess the accuracy of our capital protection framework, including available capital capacity, on and off balance sheet, and our hedges including the annuities interest rate underhedge that I discussed. I'd also note that with respect to the annuities interest rate underhedge as well as AAT, in a rising interest rate environment, capital is released from each of these and restored to our capital capacity. With respect to the other part of your question, Erik, in terms of -- are you seeking further elaboration on the change in year end? Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Yes. Where you saw the kind of statutory -- asset adequacy test strengthening? Robert Michael Falzon : Yes, so we strengthened the reserves for AT by about $1 billion year-over-year. Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. Was that in specific products? Or... Robert Michael Falzon : Well we haven't filed our statutory filings yet. And so we're not really able to provide any further insight or detail on that. So it did hit across a number of businesses and products, not specifically generated as a result of any one particular product. Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. And if I could just ask one follow-up. Under what scenarios would you begin to monetize and redeploy the $2.4 billion of the yen hedge gains? And as these settle, is there any reason they wouldn't be available capital capacity? Robert Michael Falzon : No. So if you look at the $2.4 billion that we have in fair value as of year end, the ordinary core settlements on that are about 30% of it during the course of 2015. When we articulate our capital capacity, we do not include in that capacity that fair value amount. What we do include are the settlements as they occur and work their way in. So there is nothing -- absent further changes in the level of the FX rate, which would then affect that fair value amount, there's nothing that would impede the natural order of settlements in the way that I quantified them coming into our capital capacity during the course of 2015. And then, obviously, to the extent that we accelerated any of the settlements, that would provide additional capital capacity out of that $2.4 billion. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Suneet Kamath with UBS. Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : I apologize, maybe I'm sleep deprived, but I'm confused in terms of this whole capital capacity thing. Because I thought in Mark's prepared comments, he had said that the delta between what you told us in December and what you're telling us now was what I would characterize as a definitional item, which is you're kind of earmarking some money for debt repayment, which you hadn't done back then. But then in Rob's comments, it seems like there was actually an increase in capital requirements related -- that caused the change. So again, I apologize, but I just was wondering if you can just walk us through very simply, like you told us $3.5 billion in December, and now you're telling us $2 billion. Like, can you just walk us through how we got from one to the other? Robert Michael Falzon : Yes. So let me sort of keep it very high level and try to walk you through that, Suneet. So if you take the range we gave you before, because remember we've migrated to a single definition, so we've provided a range of $3.5 billion. And then of that, $3 billion of readily deployable, that number, the 2 of those converged into what we've articulated as the $2 billion. So the delta between where we were and where we are today, as Mark described, is that we're taking some of our capacity in order to reduce the leverage. What happened during the course of the fourth quarter is that our capital leverage ratio went up by a greater amount than we would have otherwise anticipated, as a result primarily of the 2 things that I highlighted. So the interest rate underhedge and the AAT provision being greater than what we had originally expected when we set our guidance caused that -- the leverage ratio to elevate. And so if we were to reduce the leverage back down to 25%, and we think that's a prudent thing to do in light of recent levels of interest rates and the increased volatility that we have in interest rates, that requires taking that capital capacity that otherwise would've been $4 billion down to $2 billion. So there's a component of it that's a result of an elevated level of capital leverage caused primarily by those 2 events. And then, secondly, as you characterized it, a change in methodology to deduct from our capital capacity any leverage that we have in excess of that targeted 25%. Is that helpful? Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : So when Mark -- yes, I think we're getting there, but -- so when Mark said $4 billion is sort of the pro forma number had you not changed the definition, does that reflect the underhedged and the AAT? Robert Michael Falzon : Yes, so -- I'm sorry, Mark? Mark B. Grier: Yes, think about the $4 billion as if we didn't change leverage. Robert Michael Falzon : So the leverage at end of the year, absent any changes, would have been 29.6% or something in that order of magnitude that we'll wind up printing. And that would then reflect both the underhedge and AAT. And bringing that number down to 25% is what reduces us from having a notional capital capacity of $4 billion or a real capital capacity of $4 billion down to a notional amount net of the earmark for debt reduction of $2 billion. Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. I'll noodle that. My second question was just on these pension risk transfer deals that you've done. I know when you price these things, I'm assuming you're fully matched on the assets and the liabilities. And so the direction of interest rates post closing the deal really shouldn't change the economic terms of the deal. I just want to confirm that that's the case because, obviously, you've done a lot of these deals, and we've continued to see interest rates decline. So if I'm right, is it fair to assume that the decline in interest rates that we've seen is not going to impact the profitability of the business that you've written? Stephen P. Pelletier: Suneet, this is Steve. You are absolutely correct. The pension risk transfer deals, remember that in these transactions we're dealing in all cases with retirees, people have already made their elections. So the cash flows are already firmly established. Therefore, at closing, we're able to match assets and liabilities in a very robust fashion. I'd go one step further, going back in the timeline a little bit to the way you asked your questions, and that is to emphasize that between pricing and signing and closing, we have contractual provisions that protect us from changes in market conditions, including changes in interest rates between pricing and closing. Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Right. But there's not even a dynamic of you have surplus backing this business and that surplus is presumably invested in something that's earning a yield. But there's not even a dynamic of spread compression on the surplus that's backing these transactions? Stephen P. Pelletier: No, there really isn't. As I say, we're able to match assets and liabilities very robustly given the nature of the liability. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : I had another follow-up on the capital. I guess, just -- I guess, maybe just to confirm. So is the way to think about it that you had 2 capital impacts from Variable Annuity relating to interest rates and cash flow testing and that you funded those amounts with additional capital debt? Is that the right way to think about it? Robert Michael Falzon : Yes. But just to be clear, Ryan, the AAT amounts affect the entire enterprise. That's not specific to Annuities, by any means. So yes, you had from Annuities the interest rate underhedge, and then you had the enterprise-wide AAT testing, some component of which we'd obviously anticipated. It's just with the decline in the fourth quarter, it was greater than what we anticipated. Those -- the \"funding\" of those 2 came from operating debt that we had sitting on our balance sheet. We used the proceeds associated with that operating debt to fund that, and that we reclassified operating debt to capital debt. Important to note there, and I think Mark highlighted upfront, our total leverage has gone down. We've actually reduced the amount of debt that we have outstanding. This was an issue of how we label that debt. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : Got it, got it. You already had the debt. You're now using it for a different purpose, and you reclassified it. Robert Michael Falzon : Correct. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : Okay, second question. I know you guys don't tend to like to comment on your EPS guidance after you give it. But you haven't -- we haven't had a quarter in 2015 yet, and your earnings, I think, were generally lower than most of us expected. So I was just hoping if you could confirm that the $9.60 to $10.10 EPS guidance you gave in December is still a valid range. Robert Michael Falzon : So Ryan, a confirmation would be an update. So I can't actually do that. But let me offer a couple of thoughts that perhaps can help. One, if you -- the nature of your question really is expressing concern about what's the impact of the -- of this capital capacity reduction that we've articulated in the fourth quarter, and then looking at the high level of expenses that we have in the fourth quarter. Those are the 2 things, I guess, if you're thinking about how they might impact our -- the guidance that we otherwise gave and with respect to both those, what I would note is on the capital side, our guidance reflected a range of deployment including leverage reduction. So the fact that we're using a portion of our capital to reduce debt is not something that would be any different than we would've factored into a range when we put that together. With regard to expenses, recall the fourth quarter has seasonality both in -- actually both in revenues and expenses. It's international, but it's across the entire enterprise in part due to compensation and benefit true-ups in the fourth quarter. So while I'm not updating guidance, I would say there was nothing structural that changed versus our expectations for the fourth quarter. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : Can you just give us some quantification of the type of seasonality you saw in the fourth quarter to what -- relative to what you'd expect in other quarters? Robert Michael Falzon : No. I'm actually -- I'm not prepared to give you that off the top of my head, Ryan. I'd have to give that thought. I think if you looked back at our fourth quarter over the last several years, you would see a pronounced seasonality there on an enterprise basis more accentuated in our international business, obviously. Charles Frederick Lowrey : Ryan, this is Charlie. Let me just sort of give you a quick overview of the sort of expenses in the fourth quarter. Because the fourth quarter does tend to have higher expenses, as Rob said, in our International businesses, and that's a trend we've seen over the years. So I think what we would say is for total expenses, there's sort of 27%, 28% of the -- of annual expenses occur in the fourth quarter, and we see this both in Life Planner and the Gibraltar businesses for really 3 factors. First, fourth quarter always includes some nonlinear expenses. And we had some of those, as we did last year and probably always will in the fourth quarter, and those related, as Rob said, to pension-related costs and whatnot. We then have some external factors that have been there such as consumption tax and other things, and that's sort of a constant. And then there are also some internal factors. And those internal factors can be as mundane as administrative costs such as annual mailings to customers. And those occur in the fourth quarter in Japan. And so you're going to get some seasonality. There are some systems initiatives, and the costs are incurred later in the year, that usually is the case, and some end-of-life systems. So these sorts of costs will be with us going forward and have been anticipated. So in sum, on the international side, expenses were structurally not different than we would've otherwise expected for the fourth quarter, but are seasonally a bit higher. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Gallagher with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Wanted to come back to the capital situation as well. Mark, I just wanted to be clear on what you said about the yen hedge. Did you say that was $2.4 billion? Mark B. Grier: Yes, $2.4 billion pretax. Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : And is that -- how is that factored into your overall view of capital adequacy? Is that included somehow in the $2 billion figure? Mark B. Grier: It's not reflected in the capital ratios or dollar numbers that we've discussed. And as Rob said in answer to an earlier question, this will flow into available capital as the cash is realized. And about 30% of it comes in this year. And we would have options to accelerate if we chose to. So this is, I guess, sort of shadow strength that's not reflected in the headline numbers, but represents, as I said, a substantial offset to other market-related sensitivities. Robert Michael Falzon : And maybe to follow up on that, Tom, and following up on a question that was asked earlier, when we think about post year end, things that have happened, the -- and the commitments that we have -- capital commitments we have for the upcoming year both in the form of the expected closing of the Chilean AFORE [ph] business in the middle of the year as well as the further decline in interest rates post year end, we have confidence around the capital capacity that we stated as of year end because we look at those outflows of capital, but we're also looking at the inflows we have of capital during the course of 2015. They come from our free cash flow, but they also come from this monetization of the equity -- the yen equity hedge. Mark B. Grier: Yes, Tom, we've each expressed confidence in our financial strength and our capital position and our ability to implement our capital plans. And the value of that yen hedge is a source of comfort in that context. Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Got you. And then -- and just a related question, I guess. The -- if we -- I just want to really get my arms around how to think about the below-the-line VA losses we've seen. And I get the AAT year-end true-ups. But more importantly, thinking about your 2Q review, and now you're changing the actuarial review from 3Q to 2Q, if we remain in a sustained low rate environment, is it fair to say that there's risk to that $2 billion as we think about rates where they are today, if there is another sizable VA below-the-line charge? Wouldn't it consume more of that $2 billion figure today? Robert Michael Falzon : Okay, so let me sort of take that in pieces. First, with respect to sustained low interest rates, the impact in capital comes primarily as a result of a decline in interest rates. And so the position that we're articulating as to where we are today reflects the level that we're at today. Should rates prevail at this level, that does not give rise to a further need to absorb the capital capacity we have in the way that we described it occurring in the fourth quarter. Should rates decline further, then we would have some of those consequences. With respect to the VA business and the actuarial assumption updates, I guess what I would describe on that, Tom, is that we have updates to our assumptions, particularly with respect to the Annuities business. We believe we've taken appropriate steps relevant to the experience that we've reserved in Annuities and across our other businesses. And so based on what we know today, we feel comfortable with the reserves that we've put up. Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. And then, sorry, if I could squeeze one last one in, does it -- the way I'm thinking about this whole thing, and correct me if I'm wrong, has to do -- because prior to now, I think most of the charges that have been recognized in VA have been funded by -- you had enough resources in PRU global funding within that enterprise or within that entity. And is it -- have we gotten to the point now where you now need to fund all potential VA charges going forward, given what's gone on within that entity? Or if you can help me better understand that. Robert Michael Falzon : Yes, Tom. So we've always articulated how much needed to be topped up in the VA entity. And just to be clear, that's not PRU global funding. That's a separate entity through which we do -- we enter into our swaps and derivative transactions to the benefit of the entire enterprise. It would be PrucoRe, which is our captive. And then within that entity, yes, we had surplus capacity that in prior quarters absorbed some of the top-up that we need to undertake as a result of some of the below-the-line charges that you've described. In this quarter, we had to take proceeds from operating debt and then advance it to PrucoRe in order to fund the incremental losses. And that would be the case on a go-forward basis. Oh, yes, and actually just -- let me add another point on that, Tom, which I think is -- helps put some of this in perspective because I think it's important for people to understand. Our total reserves now, the hedge target at PrucoRe is approximately $8 billion today. That is the equivalent of the statutory reserves that we hold for that entity. The -- if we were to do this, the calculation of statutory reserves for the living benefit rider at the ceding companies, that number would be less than half the $8 billion. So we have a very conservative level of reserves established for our living benefit rider that results from the way in which we account and hedge for that. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Colin Devine with Jefferies. Colin W. Devine - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : All right. Let's -- if we can come back to this capital issue one more time. First, well, I'm trying to reconcile the debt as it's spread out -- split out on Page 10 with what's shown on the balance sheet, specifically the short-term debt figure that's given of what, $3.8 billion. And yet on the balance sheet, it's $1.746 billion. It's always reconciled before. So maybe just to understand what's gone on here. And then as you're doing that, I'm also trying to reconcile how on December 11, when you put out the capital numbers, I get -- how that -- are the numbers you're giving us today for excess capital cushion based on where rates are today? Or are they based on where they were at year end? Because that's, I think, what some of us are having trouble understanding what you guys are saying, because some of your comments have been if rates just stay where they are, then it's $2 billion. Or was it $2 billion based on where rates were at the end of last year? And if it was that, then how is this cushion not sort of gone right now? Robert Michael Falzon : Sure. So Colin, let me answer the second part first, then I'll come back to the borrowing numbers and hopefully reconcile them for you. So if you -- the statement we made is at -- rates as of year end gave rise to the earmarking of $2 billion of our capital capacity to bring that from the $4 billion to the $2 billion. The comment that we made with respect to what's happened since year end was that we do have -- we've -- as of today, we have identified additional capital commitments in the form of what we would have to do to mark the additional hit associated primarily with the underhedge through this -- as a result of where rates are further declined this year as well as the commitment we have should we be successful at closing on our Chilean acquisition. So when we think about those commitments that we have during the course of 2015, and there are others obviously, we line that up against the capacity we have to meet those commitments in 2015 as well, and we're comfortable that the combination of our free cash flow and other sources of capital, including, as we've mentioned, the $2.4 billion of yen equity hedge gains or fair value that will be monetized, portions of which will be monetized during the course of 2015, that those sources of capital can meet what might additionally be required as a result of the subsequent decline in interest rates and the other capital commitments that we have. Is that helpful? Colin W. Devine - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : It is, and it's not. So let's say you just decided after this call and looking at where the stock's going today, let's monetize all the yen hedges, okay? That's fine, but then we should all be -- is it fair to say we should all be taking our estimates down because those Japanese earnings are going to come across then at current exchange rates, not the 91? Is that fair? Robert Michael Falzon : No, it's not. So when we look -- when we're describing the equity hedge, that is separate and distinct from the income hedge, Colin. So the income hedges remain in place. This is in addition to those income hedges. Income hedges are in place, as we've described before, in a rolling 3-year basis. Mark B. Grier: Yes, Colin, the translation hedge that's applied as we earn yen and then report in dollars in AOI is a different hedge. And as Rob said, that stays in place. The yen capital hedge that we're referring to is a structural short yen position on the balance sheet that includes a monetization mechanism that lets us realize cash at the holding company. So they're actually 2 discrete things, and there would not be a translation hedge impact related to things that we do and as the capital hedge matures, for example. Colin W. Devine - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay, that's very helpful. And then maybe to cut to the chase which is, I think, on a lot of people's minds. Given where rates sit today, right here, right now, is it still your expectation that PRU will do $1 billion in buybacks this year? Robert Michael Falzon : So, Colin, I think as you well know, I can't answer the question with respect to what we would do on a prospective basis with regard to stock buybacks. If that's a question about our capacity and our ability to do that, I think we've addressed that capacity issue, and what we said is that we feel very comfortable with the quantification of our notional capital capacity being that $2 billion again net of what we would need to reduce our leverage ratio down to 25%. That capital capacity is available in the way that we've always articulated it. Our current authorization for buybacks runs through June. We've got about $0.5 billion left on that authorization through that period of time. And as I said, our philosophy really hasn't changed. We're managing to our leverage -- our targeted leverage ratios. We've articulated that. We've shown you a number for capital capacity that is net of that amount. We financed the growth including the extra organic growth particularly associated with PRT. We have some acquisition funding, and that's the Chilean business, and we've described that and our comfort with our ability to finance that. And importantly, we have shareholder distributions in the form of both dividends and stock buybacks. And our philosophy with regard to any and all of that has not changed. Colin W. Devine - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. Now if we can go back to what happened in the stats up with the debt, and just put that to bed. Robert Michael Falzon : Sure. So the -- I'm not sure I understand what your question is. I'm looking at the -- I presume you're talking about... Colin W. Devine - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : I'm looking at Page 10. I'm looking at Page 10 QFS under short-term debt, and that does not reconcile to your balance sheet on Page 6, and it always has in the past. So -- and it does at the end of year end '13. So is there a typo there? Or... Robert Michael Falzon : Well, I can't speak to whether there's a typo or not because I don't have the 10-K sitting in front of me. What I will tell you is... Colin W. Devine - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : It's not the 10-K, Rob. It's in your stats out. And there's -- it's a question of there's, I don't know, $2 billion of debt which seems to have moved somewhere. Robert Michael Falzon : The total debt at -- described as of December 31, 2014, is $23.7 billion. Colin W. Devine - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Where do I find that on Page 6, just to make it easy? Because I don't get that what's on Page 6. Robert Michael Falzon : Well, Colin, maybe what I would suggest is if you have specific questions with respect to the QFS and you want to tick and tie this, that's probably a good use of time after the call as opposed to before the call. Colin W. Devine - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay. The balance sheet shows 21. That's the question, Rob. Robert Michael Falzon : I'm sorry. Colin W. Devine - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay, I'll let you guys come back. But the balance sheet shows 21. That's the issue, and that became the question, is this $2 billion worth of capital that went from December 11 to now, has that just been reclassified somewhere? That's what I was getting at because the balance sheet does not show the $23 billion. Robert Michael Falzon : Yes, if you take the totals of our long-term debt and our short-term debt, that should aggregate to the total of the $23 billion, if you include -- if you exclude from that the commercial paper, which is outside of that number. Colin W. Devine - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay. I'll let you go look at the balance sheet because that's not what it totals to. Operator : And that will be from the line of John Nadel with Sterne Agee. John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : I guess, if I could just put the final nail in this capital coffin, if you will. The question I have is when you articulated the $3.5 billion, which, I guess, would have assumed a 25% debt to cap, and maybe it didn't, but this incremental requirement for lower rates by year end, at least as of the date of your outlook call through year end, rates really barely moved. I'm assuming you did that math some time before your outlook was provided. I'm just trying to get a gauge as to how much rates actually did move to eat -- to take the $3.5 billion, which, I guess, would've risen actually and been $4 billion down to $2 billion? Robert Michael Falzon : Sure, John. So -- excuse me, Nigel. John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : No, it is John. Robert Michael Falzon : Oh, it's John, I'm sorry. Got mixed up on my ordering. So John, the guidance was established on the basis of our forecast. Our forecast looks at an average of forward yield curves at the point at which we put it together. That forecast implied a year-end rate of around 2.6%, and that then drove the view of what capital may or may not be available as of -- or be required as of year end. At the point at which we did our earnings call, obviously, rates were around 2, 2-ish or somewhere in that order of magnitude. The volatility in interest rates is extreme, I think, as you well know. We have seen virtually every week movements in interest rates that have been up to 20 and 30 basis points. And so the delta between where we were forecasting to go year end and where we were as of the day we provided guidance was well within a range of kind of typical standard deviations over that period of time. And frankly, when we look at setting together our forecast, we don't alter it to reflect changes in the day-to-day movements of rates or equities. When we gave guidance, equities were above the number that we had anticipated coming into year end, and interest rates were below. We didn't adjust for either with the knowledge that neither of those numbers would be where they were on the day that we provided guidance, just as they were not on the day where we put together the forecast. John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Understood. So -- but, I mean, at the end of the day here and I recognize, I fully recognize the commentary you made earlier about capital action -- I mean, sorry, management actions and other things that are at play here. It's not just a rate discussion. But essentially what you're saying is a roughly 40-basis-point drop in rates cost you $2 billion. Robert Michael Falzon : Again, I wouldn't extrapolate that. There are a number of moving parts to that. Not to mention that when we gave guidance, we did anticipate that a certain amount of our capital would be used, as you said, to get our leverage down to 25% when we gave that guidance. And so the delta between the guidance and our number is the $3 billion to $3.5 billion down to $2 billion, not the $4 billion down to $2 billion. John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Got it. Okay, that's helpful, too. And then just -- I mean, just a quick housekeeping item. Tax rate, just since I've got you guys, tax rate was, I guess, a little bit under 26% for the full year. I think your guide has been around 27%, give or take. Is there anything sort of that we should be just structurally looking at that tax rate being somewhat lower on an ongoing basis than the 27%? Robert Michael Falzon : So the -- yes, the provision for taxes and guidance was actually a bit under 27%. I know we rounded it to 27% when we gave the guidance. And when you look at the impact to the tax rate this year, one of the large drivers to that was a reduction in our foreign taxes, largely driven by the fact that Japan lowered its tax rate down to 32%. So we will get some ongoing benefit from that going forward as well.

John, I'll hand it over to you. John R. Strangfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to say we reported strong first quarter results and are off to a solid start for the year. Overall, for the first quarter of 2015, we produced an 8% increase in adjusted operating income per share, excluding market driven and discrete items. This, in turn, meant that we achieved an annualized return on equity in excess of 16% for the period. The core fundamentals across our businesses and diversification in our earnings are key strengths and have helped us mitigate certain market headwinds such as translating our Japanese yen based earnings at a less favorable currency rate and the impact of lower new money yields. We also benefited from stronger than expected investment returns on non-coupon investments and other positive factors in the first quarter. Mark and Rob will walk through the specifics of our key drivers, results, and capital position, but I would highlight a few particularly noteworthy items. First, balancing the mix of our life insurance and longevity businesses benefited us in the quarter. As we have seen in prior first quarters, we experienced less favorable than average mortality in our Individual Life and Group Life businesses. However, this was largely offset by positive case experience in our Retirement business, mainly due to experience in our newer PRT business. Our Asset Management business generated very strong third-party net flows in both the institutional and retail businesses. The strength of our platform and continuing strong investment performance has enabled us to capitalize on the recent money in motion dynamics that have impacted the money management industry. In the Annuities business, we are seeing solid results from our product diversification strategy, with 36% of our new business this quarter representing sales of products entirely invested in fixed income strategies or that did not include living benefit guarantees. We also experienced a very good disability benefit ratio in our Group Insurance business, reflecting the continuing effects of our re-pricing actions and improvements to claims handling procedures. And while we can expect experience to vary from one quarter to another, we are pleased with the progress that the Group Insurance business has made. The fundamentals of our Life Planner business remain solid. The business produced 5% constant currency earnings and sales growth over the prior year, driven in part by a 4% increase in our Life Planner count. In Japan, we had the highest Life Planner recruitment total in a decade, as we are benefiting from the steps we took in the first half of 2014 to promote more Life Planner growth. And finally, Gibraltar produced 8% constant currency sales growth over the first quarter of 2014, driven by increases across each distribution channel. Furthermore, we're also pleased to see the stabilization we are seeing in our Life Consultant count. Overall, we continue to benefit from a strong balance sheet that has supported our steady dividend and share repurchase program, and provides us with the capital flexibility to opportunistically pursue organic and inorganic growth opportunities as they emerge. Looking ahead, we continue to invest in our businesses and infrastructure to support and enhance our effectiveness and the value we deliver to our stakeholders. So with that, I'll hand it over to Mark. Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman : Thank you, John. Good morning, good afternoon, or good evening. Thanks for joining us on the earnings call today. I'll take you through our results and then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon who will cover our capital and liquidity picture. I'll start with an overview of our financial results for the quarter shown on slide 2. On a reported basis, common stock earnings per share amounted to $2.79 for the first quarter based on after tax-adjusted operating income. Excuse me. This compares to EPS of $2.40 a year ago. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items in both the current quarter and the year-ago quarter, EPS was up by 8% amounting to $2.65 compared to $2.46 a year ago. Looking across our businesses, here are some highlights of this comparison, and I'll mention four favorable items. First, higher fees reflecting growth in account values in our annuities business and greater assets under management in our Asset Management business. Second, a greater contribution from Pension Risk Transfer business with case experience more favorable than our average expectations. Third, improved Group Insurance underwriting margins, driven by more favorable disability results. And fourth, in International Insurance, continued growth on a constant currency basis in our Life Planner operations. These benefits were partly offset by three things : one, lower contribution from net investment results with returns on non-coupon investments above our average expectations but below the exceptionally strong level of the year-ago quarter. Two, higher net expenses in several businesses. And three, less favorable currency exchange rates in International Insurance. I would also note the decreased corporate income tax rates in Japan including a recently enacted reduction drove a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter. On a GAAP basis, including amounts categorized as realized investment gains, we reported net income of just over $2 billion for the current quarter, about $700 million above our after tax adjusted operating income reflecting mark-to-market on derivatives, hedging and general portfolio activities. Book value per share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, and after adjusting the numbers to remove the impact of foreign currency exchange rate re-measurement, amounted to $69.01 at the end of the first quarter, up $4.26 from year end. The increase for the quarter was mainly driven by our net income per share of $4.37, less our quarterly dividend of $0.58. The impact of equity coming over to the class A common stock from the restructuring of our former Closed Block business that we completed at the beginning of January amounting to $1.35 per share was partly offset by refinements in the cumulative impact of foreign currency exchange rate re-measurement as we move to the new reporting structure in Japan. The remaining re-measurement balance of $4.4 billion at March 31 will decrease over time as the non-yen assets in Japan, which were in an unrealized gain position at year end, are sold or mature. Annualized ROE for the quarter, based on after tax adjusted operating income excluding market driven and discrete items and based on book value excluding AOCI and the impact of foreign currency re-measurement was 16.1%. This ROE reflects strong underlying business performance bolstered by a net benefit that we would estimate at about 130 basis points from net favorable variances in comparison to our average quarterly expectations in a number of areas. These include returns on non-coupon investments, Pension Risk Transfer case experience and Individual Life mortality, the seasonal revenue pattern in our International Insurance Life Planner business, and items that affected corporate and other results for the quarter. I'll discuss these items in more detail in reviewing our business results. Turning to slide 3, we have only two market driven and discrete items included in our results for the quarter with a net benefit to reported results of $0.14 per share. In the Annuities business, we adjusted DAC and released reserves for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits to reflect market performance, including outperformance of our separate account funds, resulting in a benefit of $0.15 per share. And in Individual Life, we absorbed integration costs of about $0.01 per share related to The Hartford Life acquisition. During the year-ago quarter, market driven and discrete items produced a net charge of $0.06 per share. Moving to slide 4, on a GAAP basis, our net income of $2 billion in the current quarter includes amounts characterized as net realized investment gains of $1.1 billion on a pre-tax basis, comprised of the items you see on this slide. Mark-to-market gains on derivatives, mainly related to management of asset and liability durations and largely driven by changes in the level of interest rates, had a positive impact of $565 million for the quarter. Product-related embedded derivatives and hedging activity had a positive impact of $265 million as the application of credit spreads to our gross GAAP liability for Variable Annuity living benefits more than offset the impact of the decline in interest rates during the quarter. General portfolio activities resulted in net pre-tax gains of $227 million. Foreign currency re-measurement resulted in a pre-tax gain of $25 million for the quarter, reflecting our mitigation of the income statement impact from this item as a result of the new reporting structure we implemented in Japan. And finally, impairments and credit losses on investments were $31 million for the quarter. Moving to our business results and starting on slide 5, I'll discuss the comparative results, excluding the market driven and discrete items I mentioned earlier. Slide 5 highlights Individual Annuities. Annuities results were $423 million for the quarter, up $14 million from a year ago. Slide 6 presents a view of our trend in earnings and return on assets. Most of our operating earnings in the Annuities business come from base contract charges linked to daily account values. The earnings increase of about 3% is essentially in line with the growth of average account values from a year ago. Return on assets, or ROA, in the Annuity business for the quarter was 107 basis points, equal to the year ago level and higher than the last few quarters. The expense level in the first quarter has historically been below the average rate for the year, contributing to the higher ROA. Slide 7 covers our Annuities sales. Our gross annuity sales for the quarter were $2.2 billion, essentially unchanged from a year ago, but with a change in mix reflecting steps we've taken to diversify the risk exposures associated with our product guarantees, to support return prospects through changing market conditions and to more broadly meet the needs of the retirement market. A modest decline in sales of our highest daily income, or HDI, guaranteed lifetime income withdrawal product was largely offset by greater contributions from two other products : our Prudential Defined Income, or PDI, product, which directs a client's entire investment to a separate account fixed income portfolio that we manage and we also had increased sales of variable annuities without living benefit guarantees. Slide 8 highlights the Retirement business. Earnings for the Retirement business amounted to $284 million for the current quarter compared to $364 million a year ago. The decrease was largely driven by a $95 million lower contribution from net investment results. While current quarter returns from non-coupon investments were about $15 million above our average expectations, results for the year-ago quarter benefited from exceptionally high returns in these asset classes, largely driven by performance from private equity funds, with a contribution that was about $80 million above average expectations. Fixed income returns were also lower in the current quarter. The lower contribution from net investment results along with higher expenses in the current quarter were partly offset by a greater contribution from case experience on Pension Risk Transfer business, which was about $45 million above our average quarterly expectations. We would estimate that about a third of this represents the impact of historical mortality patterns, which typically favor the first quarter for this business. Turning to slide 9, total Retirement gross deposits and sales were $7.3 billion for the current quarter compared to $10.3 billion a year ago. Full service gross deposits and sales, shown in the dark blue bars, were $6.3 billion for the quarter. This compares to $8.6 billion a year ago, which included a major case win of $2.6 billion. Standalone institutional gross sales were about $1 billion in the current quarter, down from $1.7 billion a year ago. Sales of stable value wrap products, which amounted to $1.4 billion a year ago, were insignificant in the current quarter. The decrease in sales of these products was partly offset by a Pension Risk Transfer case of about $660 million that funded in the current quarter. As we have commented in the past, sales of both full service and institutional Retirement products can fluctuate meaningfully on a quarterly basis. Institutional standalone net outflows for the quarter were $2.5 billion. Net outflows of about $1.3 billion of stable value wrap business and roughly $1 billion of ongoing attrition of our jumbo Pension Risk Transfer cases together with runoff of legacy business more than offset our new sales during the quarter. Total Retirement account values amounted to $365 billion at the end of the quarter, up $37 billion or 11% from a year earlier, reflecting net flows of about $25 billion, largely driven by Pension Risk Transfer business and favorable market performance. Slide 10 highlights the Asset Management business. The Asset Management business reported adjusted operating income of $205 million for the current quarter compared to $193 million a year ago. While most of the segment's results come from Asset Management fees, the increase from a year ago was driven by a $15 million greater contribution from incentive, transaction, strategic investing and commercial mortgage activities. This contribution, which amounted to $47 million for the current quarter, is inherently variable since it reflects changing valuations and the timing of transactions. Current quarter revenues for the Asset Management business were up 10% from a year ago, largely reflecting higher Asset Management fees driven by a 10% increase in unaffiliated third-party institutional and retail assets under management, which totaled $469 billion at the end of the quarter. Net inflows for the current quarter were very strong at $7.7 billion, about equally divided between institutional and retail business. The benefit of Asset Management revenue growth was largely offset by higher expenses, including roughly $15 million divided about equally between investments that we've made in the business to build teams and infrastructure to expand our product and distribution capabilities, and higher upfront commissions associated with the $4 billion of retail asset inflows in the quarter. Slide 11 highlights our U.S. Individual Life business. Individual Life earnings were $125 million for the current quarter, compared to $133 million a year ago. The decrease in earnings was driven by less favorable claims experience in the current quarter. Contribution to current quarter results for mortality experience, including related amortization and reserve updates, was about $35 million less favorable than our average expectations. This compares to a mortality contribution about $25 million less favorable than our average expectations a year ago on the same basis. Historically, the first quarter has tended to reflect a lower contribution from mortality experience than in average for the year. Individual Life mortality has been more favorable than our average expectations for the preceding three quarters and for the full years 2014 and 2013. Lower expenses in the current quarter, including net recoveries of about $10 million from servicing legacy participating business, which we would consider to be unusually favorable, largely offset a lower contribution from investment results. Slide 12 shows Individual Life sales. Based on annualized new business premiums, which amounted to $124 million for the current quarter, essentially unchanged from a year ago. Variable life sales, shown in the green bars, increased by $9 million, reflecting feature enhancements we introduced in May and September of last year to broaden the appeal of our products. Term Insurance sales in the gray bars are up $7 million from a year ago, benefiting from pricing changes we made last August to enhance our competitive position where we see opportunities to offer attractive value propositions with appropriate expected returns. The increased sales of variable life and term were largely offset by lower universal life sales, which benefited a year ago from residual sales of legacy Hartford products. Slide 13 highlights the Group Insurance business. Group Insurance earnings amounted to $30 million in the current quarter, compared to $6 million a year ago. The increase reflected a substantial improvement in Group Disability claims experience and lower expenses in the current quarter, partially offset by less favorable Group Life claims experience. Slide 14 presents our earnings trend for Group Insurance and benefit ratios for Group Life and Group Disability. In Group Disability, favorable current quarter experience, driven by fewer new claims at a greater benefit from claims resolutions produced a 72.2% benefits ratio, the lowest in recent years. This compares to a ratio of over 100% a year ago, reflecting an adverse fluctuation in long-term disability claims. While we've taken steps to improve results, including pricing adjustments and enhancement to our claims management processes, we continue to expect that claims experience will vary from one quarter to another. The Group Life benefits ratio was slightly above our expected range and up from a year ago, reflecting a higher average new claim size, which more than offset a lower claim count. Moving now to International Insurance, slide 15 highlights our Life Planner operations. Our Life Planner business reported earnings of $439 million for the quarter, essentially unchanged from a year ago. Results benefited from continued business growth with insurance revenues, including premiums, policy charges and fees, up 8% from a year ago on a constant dollar basis. The benefit to results from continued business growth was partly offset by higher expenses, driven by a range of items including technology costs and non-deferrable distribution costs. Mortality experience was largely unchanged from the year-ago quarter, with a contribution to current quarter results about $15 million greater than our average expectations. Foreign currency exchange rates, which reflect our hedging of yen income at \u00a591 in 2015 versus \u00a582 a year ago, had a negative impact of $17 million on earnings in comparison to a year ago. Slide 16 shows the quarterly pattern of earnings for our Life Planner operations over the last six quarters. Looking at the trend, you can see the seasonality pattern that favors the first quarter, which results from a concentration of annual mode premium revenues. We would estimate that this benefited current quarter earnings by about $30 million in relation to a quarterly average. Slide 17 highlights Gibraltar Life and other operations. Gibraltar Life reported earnings of $395 million for the current quarter compared to $418 million a year ago. The current quarter benefited from a greater contribution from net investment results than a year ago including about $40 million of returns that we would consider to be above our average expectations on non-coupon investments. The greater contribution to earnings from net investments results was largely offset by higher net expenses in the current quarter including technology costs and a benefit in the year-ago quarter from fixed asset sales. Mortality experience was also about $15 million below our average expectations in the current quarter. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact of $19 million in the comparison of results from a year ago. Turning to slide 18, overall, International Insurance sales on a constant dollar basis were $780 million for the current quarter, up $47 million or 6% from a year ago. Slide 18 is a product view of our sales. The sales increase was driven by death protection products, shown in the dark blue bars, partly offset by lower sales of Retirement products in the light blue bars. Death protection products including term insurance and whole life represented about 60% of current quarter sales, largely consistent with the preceding quarter, but up from just over 50% a year ago. The change in mix reflected higher death protection sales across our distribution channels, both in Japan and other countries, and a commission rate change that elevated Retirement sales in Japan in the year-ago quarter. Slide 19 breaks out Life Planner sales. Life Planner sales were $366 million in the current quarter, up $17 million or 5% from a year ago. Sales by our Life Planners in Japan were $245 million in the current quarter compared to $249 million a year ago. As shown in the light blue bars, sales of Retirement products decreased by $38 million to $73 million for the current quarter, reflecting elevated sales in the year-ago quarter driven by the change in commission rates that I mentioned. This decrease was largely offset by an increase of death protection product sales including term insurance shown in the dark blue bars. Sales outside of Japan in the green bars were up $21 million from a year ago, mainly driven by increases in Brazil and Korea. Slide 20 shows Gibraltar Life sales. Sales from Gibraltar Life were $414 million in the current quarter, up $30 million or 8% from a year ago with increases in each of the three distribution channels. Life Consultant sales, shown in the dark blue bars, increased by $4 million or 2% from a year ago, as higher productivity measured by policies sold per agent per month more than offset a decrease of about 160 or 2% in Life Consultant count. The count has largely stabilized over the past few quarters and the decline reflects our continuing active management of the sales force, including minimum production requirements together with selectivity and recruiting. Sales through the bank channel, shown in the light blue bars, amounted to $171 million for the current quarter, up $21 million or 14% from a year ago. The increase was driven mainly by greater sales of recurring premium whole life insurance. These products are particularly attractive to clients focused on the increased inheritance tax in Japan since their structure enables use of annual gift tax exemptions to efficiently transfer estate wealth. Sales through independent agents, shown in the gray bars, amounted to $68 million in the current quarter. The $5 million increase from a year ago was driven by greater sales of fixed annuity and death protection products. Slide 21 shows the results of corporate and other operations. Corporate and other operations reported a loss of $253 million for the current quarter compared to a $342 million loss a year ago. The reduction in the loss reflects lower net expenses and a greater contribution from investment income in the current quarter. While expenses in corporate and other are inherently variable, the current quarter level is below our recent average partly due to a benefit of roughly $20 million from fixed asset sales. The contribution from investment income in the current quarter includes about $30 million of returns on assets that were previously associated with our former Closed Block business and initially transferred to corporate and other when we completed the restructuring of that business at the beginning of this year. We would expect the vast majority of these assets to be utilized or deployed in the relative near term. And now, I'll hand it over to Rob. Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Mark. I'm going to give you an update on some key items under the heading of financial strength and flexibility. Starting on slide 22, we continue to manage our insurance companies to levels of capital that we believe are consistent with AA standards. For Prudential Insurance, we managed to a 400% RBC ratio. As of year-end, Prudential Insurance reported an RBC ratio of 498%, with total adjusted capital, or TAC, of $15 billion. While we don't perform a quarterly bottoms-up RBC calculation, we estimate that our RBC ratio as of the end of the first quarter is well above our 400% target. In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margins of 909% and 898% as of their December 31, 2014, which is their most recent reporting date. These are comfortably above our 600% to 700% targets. Our Japanese companies will soon report solvency margins as of their March 31, 2015 fiscal year-end. And while calculations are not yet final, we expect that we will continue to be in a strong position relative to our targets. Looking at our overall capital position on slide 23, we calculate our on balance sheet capital capacity by comparing the statutory capital position of Prudential Insurance to our 400% target RBC ratio, and then add capital capacity held in our other operations including in Japan and of the parent company. As of year-end, we estimated our available on balance sheet capital capacity at approximately $2 billion on a net basis. This represented about $4 billion of gross capital capacity, less $2 billion to pay down debt in order to arrive at our long-term targeted financial leverage ratio of 25%. During the first quarter, our estimated gross on balance sheet capital capacity increased from about $4 billion to over $4.5 billion. On a net business, after earmarking roughly $2 billion for debt paydowns to arrive at our targeted 25% financial leverage ratio, capital capacity at the end of the first quarter increased to over $2.5 billion. The increase in our net capital capacity during the quarter was the result of capital generated by our businesses and the benefit of about $500 million after tax from our Japan capital hedge, including about $300 million from cash settlements and $200 million from hedges that were locked in. These contributors to our capital capacity more than offset a modest net negative decline from interest rates in the quarter. And about $500 million of shareholder distributions, including $250 million of share repurchases and our quarterly dividend of $0.58 per share. The fair value of the Japan capital hedge, after subtracting the first quarter settlements and lock-ins would be about $2 billion as of the end of the quarter. Turning to the cash position at the parent company, cash and short-term investments, net of outstanding commercial paper, amounted to about $3.7 billion as of the end of the first quarter. The cash in excess of our targeted $1.3 billion liquidity cushion is available to repay maturing operating debt, to fund operating needs and to deploy over time for strategic and capital management purposes. Now, I'll turn it back over to John. John R. Strangfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, thank you, Rob. Thank you, Mark. Now, we'd like to open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. And our first question will come from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, I had a couple of questions on your international business. Gibraltar, your sales were up a lot and I think in the bank channel, you've had success selling more than the paid premium products. So we've seen some other companies back out of the bank channel. So what type of returns are you getting on bank channel sales in the current interest rate environment? And then secondly, on the Life Planner count, it was up 2% sequentially this quarter. So is something changing in the business or was this an aberration this quarter, because that seems stronger than it's been in the recent past? Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman : Sure, let me take those in order, Jimmy. And let me start by making some overall comment about sort of the rate environment and how we approach pricing, and then I'll get into the bank channel and then I'll answer your second question. But my first comment is an important one, and that is we have expected profitability targets for each of our products, and margins may vary or hurdle rates may vary on specific products, but every product has to stand on its own merit. So we don't have loss leader products in any sense. As a result, we continue to examine our product lineup and its profitability, adjusting pricing when necessary to reflect lower rate levels, and we also reduce commissions or discontinue sales of certain products that can't meet profit expectations. As an example, Gibraltar Life stopped selling a six-year single premium endowment product effective at the end of this quarter just because we thought we should eliminate it from the product lineup. So in terms of an overall framework with which we think about profitability, we really have three different aspects to it. You can think of three circles, and we talked about this before. But first, you have the customer need and you have to provide products to fulfill those needs. Secondly, you have product profitability and each product, again, has to stand on its own relative to the hurdle rate we've established for it. And third, you have business mix, which is how much of any given product do we want to sell relative to return and to risk. So, if we think about that relative to the bank strategy, what I would say is that we have a very differentiated strategy relative to others. When we first acquired Star/Edison, there were over 100 banks in total, but consistent with what we've done in the independent agency channel or even with the number of life consultants we have, we reduced the number of relationships focusing on quality product and service and focusing on fit with our partners. We now have about 60 partners that currently offer our products and we sold through over 90% of them this past quarter. So, three points of differentiation that affect the profitability of our product within the bank segment. First is that we provide exceptional service to our banking partners. We cover the banks with over 200 (35:36) that come from Life Planners and this will get to the other comment in a minute about Life Planners. And so we don't necessarily have to have the lowest price. We have to have a reasonable price on our product, but we don't have to have the lowest price because we're not spread-sheeted, we're thought of in a different way and that is the relationship we have with the banks and the service we provide to them. That leads to the second point, which is our focus on death protection. So, the majority of our sales include mortality and expense margins. In other words, 70% of our first quarter sales had an M&E component to it. Additionally, we have a higher proportion of recurring premium insurance products, as opposed to just having savings products. So, two-thirds of the recurring premium insurance products are 10 Pay and longer, they're just not three Pay accelerated to a single premium. But in terms of single premium, the single premium annuity life products we do sell through the channel are re-priced twice a month, taking into account current interest rates, and most have MVA features. So we feel very good about the differentiated strategy we employ, the mix of products we sell, and the resultant profitability of the business. So that hopefully answers your first question. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman : Now, in terms of the second question, in terms of LP count and why it was up so much, you may recall that last year we said that we had a very high number of Life Planners that moved over to become sales managers and they transferred over in April of 2014. That has led directly to higher recruiting. Now, it takes a while for those sales managers to get up to speed, to train, to start looking for recruiting, but what we said back then in the second quarter call was that we would expect to see a larger number of LPs come on board at the end of the year or the beginning of this year. So there's really a couple of things happening. There is much higher recruiting that's taking place as a result of the higher number of sales managers, but there's also fewer terminations given the amount of business that we're doing. Now, in terms of the overall LP count, what we can say is that if you look over a five-year period, you really see a lower growth rate than this quarter. So if you were to average out the LP count in Japan, it's really over five years been sort of 1% to 2%. We've had some quarters that are flat, maybe some that are a little negative if we've transferred a lot of LPs over to SMs, but in general \u2013 and then some that have been higher as a result of that. But in general, it's sort of 1% to 2%. If you look at the Life Planner business as a whole within PII, you'll see that the Life Planner growth over five years has been sort of 2% to 3% because you have a higher growth rate in places like Brazil and perhaps some others. But that's generally what you expect. So this is higher than we'd normally expect, but you'd expect some aberration quarter-to-quarter depending upon the dynamics of how many people we've transferred and what's going on. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then lastly, if I could ask about your tax rate overall, I think you'd spoken about 27%-ish or so previously, but the tax rate was 25.6% this quarter. So what drove that and what's your expectation for the year? Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Jimmy, it's Rob Falzon. The primary driver to the difference between the tax rate we gave at guidance, which was actually just a little under 27%, and the number that you're seeing in our first quarter results was the decreases in taxes in Japan. We blend that it into our overall tax rate as a result of the earnings that we keep there versus repatriating, we wind up with the delta that you've seen and that number, the 25.6%, is the number that we think is sustainable for the year. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Dally with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions on capital. First, you commented that declining interest rates were only a slight negative to available capital. Does that imply that the recent backswing in rates that we've seen thus far this quarter will only be a slight positive? And then on the Japan capital hedge, what should we expect with regards to further gains over the remainder of the year, assuming no major changes in exchange rates from here? Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Nigel, it's Rob again. So, let me first use this as an opportunity on the interest rate question to talk a little bit more broadly on how we connect risks with the management of capital. And we've hit on this theme at both Investor Day and Financial Strength Symposium, but it's probably good to set the context. First, our businesses and the capital that supports those businesses are sensitive to the markets. Our construct is a capital protection framework that we've spoken about before, and that's what we use to manage the sensitivity. We think about risks as being a spectrum between tail events and less severe scenarios, which we think about as being in the, quote, body of the distribution of volatility. Our objective is to take off the table risks that are associated with tail events. For less extreme market conditions, things that are in the body of the distribution, we hedge the vast majority of those risks, particularly in the equity and the interest rate worlds, and we think about those risks across our business units as they're netted at the enterprise level. In John's opening remarks, he observed that our longevity and mortality experiences in our different businesses largely offset each other and with respect to interest rates, we have a similar phenomenon in that our annuities are exposed to declining rates. But other parts of our businesses actually have exposure to rising rates, particularly a spike in interest rates. We calibrate our hedging in order to accept some level of volatility in our excess capital capacity. It's necessary because as we've described earlier and particularly on the fourth quarter call, the nature of these risks are non-linear. They change as markets move and the available hedging instruments that we have sometimes don't track these movements well. Additionally, the risks vary between businesses. In any given period, the economics may get offset but the accounting doesn't always reflect this. And to the extent that we have capital being generated in one business and capital needed in another that is not always fungible in a particular period, we have to wait for future periods in order to monetize those offsets. We're constantly recalibrating our hedging to address the tail risks as markets move and as our capital capacity and leverage change. We have multiple tools for doing this to ensure that we remain within our risk tolerances. And probably the one last thing I want to add on this is that in the normal of course of our business, we generate a substantial amount of excess capital from our businesses annually. It's why we've increased our guidance around free cash flow up to about 60% of AOI. If you look in the course of 2014 and this quarter, over 40% of our normalized operating income has been returned or distributed in the form of dividends and share repurchases while reducing our debt by over $2 billion and funding our PRT and M&A pipeline. So with that as a way of sort of context, let me talk specifically about the interest rate sensitivity in the quarter and comparing that to the first quarter and your question about what may happen when interest rates come up. First vis-\u00e0-vis last quarter, the level of rate movement is about half what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2014. And recall that the sensitivity we had then was driven in large part by AAT and within AAT there was a large component that was driven by model refinements, not interest rate movements in and of themselves. With respect to Pruco Re specifically, it had less of an impact this quarter and that's because as rates continue to decline, the option portion of our hedging becomes more meaningful. We become less sensitive to rate movements as rates decline. So the converse of that is that as rates climb back up, we actually recapture some of that movement in rate. So it is not symmetric, it's actually somewhat asymmetric in terms of the trade-off between capital and the movement in interest rates. The offset to what happens in Pruco Re is in other businesses. There, as I noted before, many of which have some long sensitivity to interest rates and so the net capital capacity impact between what happens in the Annuity business and Pruco Re and what happens in our other business that are manifested in PICA and other entities is actually relatively modest. And we look to monetize in order to be able to offset those things as we're able to get dividends out of our subsidiaries. So, in the case of PICA, by way of example, we filed for a $2 billion dividend and we received regulatory approval for that dividend and expect that to come up in the course of the second quarter. And that will help us to then monetize the positive variance we had from interest rate movements or offset the negative variance that we had within Pruco Re. I think your last question was on FX and the equity hedge. We had about a $0.5 billion this quarter that \u2013 of increased capacity from that. About $300 million of that was what was normally coming in the form of settlements during the period. And then there was about $200 million that resulted from an acceleration of our \u2013 of locking in the settlements. I would note that the capital capacity would have increased even if we hadn't done this acceleration that was more of a tactical initiative. And the value of the hedges that we currently have in place, net of the $500 million that we've counted to our capital capacity this quarter, is still around $2 billion. On a pre-tax basis, you'll see around 10% or so of that still available to be monetized this year. And there's about 20% that's scheduled to be monetized next year. That's all assuming that exchange rates don't change from where they are today. Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erik Bass with Citigroup. Your line is open. Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, thank you. Rob, just wanted to follow up on a couple of your comments on capital and kind of your willingness to accept some volatility there. I guess, first, how do you think about that volatility ahead of being subject to a potential balance sheet stress test from the Fed? And do you think that they would view kind of volatility the same way? And secondly, with the $2.5 billion of deployable excess capital, do you view that as all truly deployable or does some of it need to be retained as a buffer in case markets move against you in the short-term? Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman : Erik, this is Mark. Let me start off with a comment on capital standards. As you know, we don't yet have capital standards. We're constructively engaged in the process of developing capital standards with the Federal Reserve domestically, but also as part of a number of moving parts on the international arena. And I think it's early to speculate on the context of stress test and short-term volatility without the underpinning of the genuine view of capital. And as you know, the way we've talked about it and the points I made, for example, about margins and reserves on Investor Day, we take a longer term view of the loss absorption capacity of the company, which is, in many respects, a totally separate point from short-term accounting volatility. And so I'd be thinking about the fact that loss absorption capacity and quarterly accounting volatility are very different points. The real constructive approach to solvency and stress testing will focus on loss absorption capacity and the assets that we have available to meet all of our obligations. However, they're categorized as line items on the GAAP financials. And I'll ask Rob if he wants to add anything to that and then let him take the second. Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, I would merely observe that we do look at tail events and we try to take that risk off the table, as I indicated. So while we don't have a construct in place to the extent that that's stress testing, as we anticipate, we'll be looking at severe scenarios. That's the risk that we try to address through our capital protection framework that we don't tolerate and don't want to see that variability come in on a quarter to quarter basis. With regard to the variability quarter to quarter, yeah, there'll be some noise in our capital capacity as a result of interest rate movements. We'd expect as interest rates move back up that that will add to our capital capacity in the way that it is moderately trimmed on capital capacity in this quarter as we described. Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks, that's helpful. And then, just one quick question on PRT. Can you give us a sense of how quickly the earnings in capital run off on the funded deals? And how much capital will be freed from prior deals in 2015? Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, U.S. Businesses: Erik, this is Steve. I'll comment on the asset front. Generally speaking in PRT, on the funded side, we experience about $700 million in runoff on a quarterly basis and on the longevity side, about $400 million. Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And I don't have a specific forecast on what that would do to our capital capacity. Obviously, what happens is as those are running off the reserves in the pad that we have in those reserves burns off as well and then, we'll establish some level of increase in our capital capacity. Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning. Rob, just to start out, just a follow-up on the interest rate sensitivity to capital comments you made. Would that also be true if you look at through, say, year-end 2015 that your sensitivity would be less to a further decline in rates all else equal relative to the way it played out last year? Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, I assume, Tom, you're referring to the impact of AAT, and I'd sort of make two observations. The first is that... Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Well, sorry, Rob, AAT and VA sensitivity, we'll call it. Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Okay. So the VA sensitivity, as I described, further declines in interest rates \u2013 that volatility is substantially muted to further declines in interest rates because of the impact of the \u2013 of options in our hedging strategy. And so, it is likely that what you'll see, as you look forward, is if interest rates were to move down further, you would see that the declines there would be more muted and would continue to be substantially offset by the gains that we would have in other parts of the enterprise. And we try to calibrate it just that way. With outside of Pruco Re, with respect to the broader impact of AAT, I would reiterate what I said before, which is a substantial portion of our AAT increased during the course of last year was a result of model refinements. The actual impact resulting from interest rates was a smaller component of that. And as we look forward, we would expect, therefore, that the impact from AAT would not be particularly draconian, but that'll be a function of actually where interest rates wind up at year end. I think as you know, there's a \u2013 the way that formula works, there's a flooring mechanism, which is calibrated off the five-year and so as rates continue to decline, the impact from AAT actually gets moderated as those rates go down. Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Right. Okay, thanks. And of the remaining $2 billion Japan capital hedge, should we think about all of that over time being monetizeable and into the excess capital bucket? Or is there some portion of that that we should be thinking about that you'd need to hold against the risk in the Japanese business whether that's because you have a contingency plan that if the yen were to strengthen, again, you would need to use it or otherwise. Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, that $2 billion \u2013 the fair value of that will fluctuate as the currency exchange rate fluctuates, Tom. So to the extent that there's appreciation of the yen, the $2 billion would be a lesser number on a go-forward basis. Putting that aside, which is that it will reflect where exchange rates are, it reflects where they are today. On an absolute basis, whatever that number is, it is completely available as capital to us and does not otherwise need to be held back for any reserves. Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got you. And last question. The comments made about the Closed Block, the $2.6 billion of assets that are currently in corporate and other would be utilized or deployed over the near term, is that to reduce debt or commercial paper? Can you just clarify what that's going to be used for? Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So that $2.6 billion will be redeployed out of corporate and other, and hence why we've called out the gain in corporate other associated with it. The way in which it gets deployed was contemplated in the guidance that we established at the beginning of the year. And so, there's a range of things that we could do with that that vary between debt reduction and M&A and distributions to shareholders. So without getting \u2013 being particularly specific about that, what I would note is how we deploy that will influence where we thought in the range of guidance we might come out and the expectation is that that would be happening in a \u2013 that we would get it out of corporate and other on a relatively rapid basis, meaning in the next quarter or two. Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Rob, that's all factored into the excess capital guidance that you've given out? Or is this somehow in addition? Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, that is factored in the \u2013 the capital capacity that exists is factored in and that is part of the $2 billion dividend that we'll be getting out of PICA that was approved by our regulators. Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, everybody. And maybe shifting gears a little bit from the capital side, I was curious to hear your thoughts and comments about the DOL proposal. I think one of your peers recently mentioned that VA sales to qualified plans could fall by up to 15% or 20% for the industry as a whole. So want to hear your thoughts on that and where you see Pru fall in respect to that number. Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, U.S. Businesses: Yaron, this is Steve Pelletier. Let me address your question and I'll address it more broadly and then touch upon a few particular areas, including the Annuities business. First off, just let me say right up-front that we certainly support a regulatory framework that helps ensure client confidence in the advice, the services and the solutions they receive. We're reviewing the proposed regulation and we will be participating in the industry commentary. As it stands today, as it's written today, the proposed regulation would certainly have some industry-wide impacts of increased compliance costs for starters. At the same time, though, we think that our business mix and the strength of our franchises position us pretty well for adapting to any changes that are brought about by this regulation. Let me give examples of that in three areas of potential impact that are being widely discussed. First, IRA rollovers. As it stands today, the regulation could make that process more complicated. But the IRA rollovers that we do directly with clients are a modest portion of our overall business mix. And if these regulations do result in a higher retention of assets and DC plans, that would be a positive offset that we'd have in our Retirement business. Second, speaking of Retirement, let me talk for a minute about DC record keeping. Our business in that space has a couple of key risk mitigants in regard to the proposed regulation. Virtually, all of our business is done with companies who have over 100 participants in their plan, and that's not by accident. That's due to our mid-market focus in this business. And that segment, as you know, is relatively less affected by the proposals. Also, we've always approached this business with an open architecture philosophy as it regards the investment platform. We certainly have participation of proprietary offerings on our platform, because we have high-quality proprietary offerings, but we don't rely on those offerings being predominant in the platform. The third area of potential impact would be something that we'd experience jointly with our distribution partners in the Annuities business, as you asked about. We have very strong distribution relationships and we have top tier positions in every major distribution channel in the business. We offer a range of products and solutions, and as John and Mark both mentioned in their opening comments, that diversified product range is really gaining traction in the business. And those solutions all come with a range of compensation options for the advisor, ranging from commission-based to fee-based. I think we will need to do some work with our distribution partners to ensure continued availability of solutions to clients, but we do feel that all the factors I just mentioned give us the basis for doing that work with our partners to achieve the very important goal of ensuring that their clients have continued access to high-quality retirement income options, very much including the guaranteed lifetime income that is really distinctive to the annuities industry and that we'll be able to make these offerings available on terms that work for everybody, including, of course, the Prudential shareholder. Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So a follow-up on that. As you're selling more of the non-living benefit guaranteed product, do you think that would come under greater pressure with this proposal? And also could you maybe give us some quantification as to what percentage of your VA business is qualified versus \u2013 is in qualified plans versus non-qualified or what percentage is from a fee commission \u2013 fee business versus a commission business? Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, U.S. Businesses: About two-thirds of our business, Yaron, is done with qualified money, that's consistent with industry averages. And if you're talking about the compensation breakdown, about a third is done on a purely commission based \u2013 sorry, about two-thirds is done on purely commission-based business and the remainder is done with a mix of commission-based and fee-based. Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And then thoughts on living benefits or... Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, U.S. Businesses: I think the living benefit strategy and looking to diversify our product range is a strategy that we would continue to maintain over time. I don't think that particular element would be specifically impacted by the regulatory change. Like I say, what we need to do is work with our distribution partners to ensure that we can make the adjustments necessary to provide continued availability of the full range of product sets to their clients. Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you for the comments. Mark Finkelstein - Senior Vice President, Head- Investor Relations : Thank you. Cynthia, I think we'll take one more question, please. Operator : Thank you. And that will be from the line of Steve Schwartz with Raymond James. Your line is open. Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. Just a quick couple. Mark, you talked about the adverse mortality in life, the $35 million. And it wasn't clear to me, are you referencing that $35 million relative to a quarterly average, or were you referencing that $35 million relative to what would normally be adverse seasonality in the first quarter? Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Steve, it's actually Rob. That quantification is against an average for the year, so it is not adjusted for seasonality. Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Rob, would you happen to know if it were, what the effect would be? Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, I don't. Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Something to get from Mark. And then just one more. Going back to the question of VA and the effective interest rates, I just want to make sure I understand what you're saying here. At lower rates, okay, the sensitivity is lower such that if rates were to go lower from here, it wouldn't be that big of a deal, and there are other areas in the business that would benefit, that would make up the difference? Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman : They would directionally offset. They aren't perfectly hedged but you'll see derivative marks going the other way from the specific impact of interest rates on the VA living benefit hedge. Now, keep in mind there are a lot of moving parts in that VA living benefit hedge. So you can't always look at that and make a linear connection to interest rates either. But I think the answer to your question is there are directional offsets in other parts of the company, as Rob referenced, that mitigate the impact of interest rates directly on the VA living benefit. Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. So to follow up from that, that would be at this level but it didn't really when you move down from 2.6% to 2.19% or wherever we were. Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman : Are you talking about the fourth quarter movement? Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Right. Yeah, I'm trying to compare the two. Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman : Yeah. So as I mentioned, what happens is as rates get lower and we remove the tail risk associated with continued lower interest rates, the hedging strategy that we have kicks in such that we have a significantly more muted effect at current levels than we would have at levels that would have been mid 2% range. Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : But even in the fourth quarter, I don't have this number right in front of me, but there were gains on duration management derivatives of several hundred million dollars that went the other way from the move you're talking about. So, the answer is, yes, there was some of that in the fourth quarter. There were less other things that mitigated the overall impact, but there was a meaningful, meaning several hundred million dollars, going the other way in other derivative marks. And you can find it if you go back and look, or call Mark, we'll tell you the answer. I don't remember the exact number. Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. I will do that. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you, and ladies and gentlemen, today's teleconference will be available for replay after 1 :30 p.m. today until midnight, May 14.

John, I'll hand it over to you. John Robert Strangfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Prudential reported strong second quarter results driven by solid fundamentals across our businesses. We achieved operating earnings per share of $2.62 after adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, representing a 4% increase over prior year earnings. This quarter's ROE is in excess of 15% as we continue to outperform our longer term target of 13% to 14%. Our operating results reflect solid core growth fundamentals across many of our businesses and favorable underwriting margins, which more than offset the headwinds presented by continuing low-interest rates and adverse currency impacts. Net income for the quarter was modestly above operating earnings. And I would also highlight that, during the quarter, we completed our annual review of actuarial assumptions and this had a relatively benign impact on current quarter results. Mark and Rob will walk through the specifics of our key drivers, results, and capital position. I will provide some high-level observations. To start, we are pleased with the core growth drivers across our enterprise. Retirement and Asset Management both had $6 billion of positive net flows. Retirement benefited from pension risk transfer cases that closed in the quarter and Asset Management continues to attract assets based on its strong investment performance and proven capabilities. Our Individual Life Insurance business produced 26% sales growth over the prior year. This was accomplished while achieving appropriate returns and meeting product diversification targets. We also completed our integration of The Hartford Life acquisition, with targeted run rate annual savings of $90 million achieved and integration costs a little better, meaning lower than our expectations. And we had solid sales results in our International business, producing overall sales growth of 6% over the prior year with increases in both our Life Planner and Gibraltar businesses. I would highlight that Life Planner constant currency insurance revenue growth was a solid 9% over the prior year. Our Annuities business continues to show stable sales results, as we have carefully managed pricing and product features. But importantly, our product and risk diversification effort is showing success. Only about one-third of our total Annuities sales this quarter includes equity focused living benefit guarantees where we retain the exposure. And over time, this should help lower the volatility in our Annuities business. We also benefited this quarter from strong underwriting margins in several of our businesses, including our Life Insurance and Retirement businesses, which produced underwriting results better than our average expectations. And our Group Insurance business continues to benefit from pricing and underwriting actions in our disability block. Overall, as we look at our businesses and our opportunities for measured growth, we remain confident that we will continue to produce strong earnings that will generate substantial deployable capital that can be used to support outsized organic and inorganic growth initiatives and returns of capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks all while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Recall that we believe our business model generates cash flow equal to about 60% of operating earnings over time. Now, DOL. As most of you are aware, we followed a comment letter on July 21 with the Department of Labor in response to proposed regulations that effectively redefine who will be considered a fiduciary in transactions that involve certain plans, plan participants, and IRAs. In that letter, we have requested clarification on certain provisions within the proposed regulation as well as made suggestions for modifications to ensure that consumer access to important retirement products is not impeded. And while we embrace effective regulation, like others, we are concerned about unintended consequences that could have \u2013 result from these proposed regulations. Having said that, we benefit from a diversified business model by geography, by product, and by distribution channel. And so while the process is still very much in flux, we remain confident that we will successfully navigate whatever the ultimate outcome may be. Otherwise, we continue to work with our Federal Reserve supervisor and international regulatory bodies on capital frameworks and remain encouraged with the dialogue in developing capital standards that reflect the unique attributes of insurance. With that, I'll hand it over to Mark. Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman : Thanks, John, good morning, good afternoon, or good evening. Thank you for joining our earnings call this morning. I'll take you through our results and then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon, who will cover our capital and liquidity picture. I'll start with an overview of our financial results for the quarter shown on slide two. On a reported basis, common stock earnings per share amounted to $2.91 for the second quarter based on after-tax adjusted operating income. This compares to EPS of $2.49 a year ago. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items in both the current quarter and the year-ago quarter, EPS was up 4%, amounting to $2.62 compared to $2.51 a year ago. Looking across our businesses, here are some highlights of this comparison. I'll mention four key items. First, higher fees reflecting growth in average account values in our Annuities business and greater assets under management in our Asset Management business. Second, improved claims and reserve experience in our U.S. Insurance businesses. Third, a greater contribution from pension risk transfer case experience, which continued to be more favorable than our average expectations. And fourth, in International Insurance, continued growth on a constant currency basis in our Life Planner operations. These benefits were offset by three primary items. One, higher net expenses in several businesses. Two, a lower contribution from net investment results with returns on non-coupon investments below our average expectations in the current quarter. And three, less favorable currency exchange rates in International Insurance. I would also note that decreased corporate income tax rates in Japan drove a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter. On a GAAP basis, including amounts categorized as realized investment gains or losses and results from divested businesses, we reported net income of $1.4 billion for the current quarter, modestly above our after-tax adjusted operating income. We've taken some steps to mitigate volatility of our reported net income in relation to the operating results driven by our business performance, particularly with respect to foreign currency exchange rate remeasurement. Book value per share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, and after adjusting the numbers to remove the impact of foreign currency exchange rate remeasurement, amounted to $71.09 at the end of the second quarter, up by $6.34 from year-end after the payment of two quarterly dividends totaling $1.16 per share. This includes the benefit of the Closed Block restructuring in the first quarter. Annualized ROE for the first half of the year was 15.6% based on after-tax adjusted operating income excluding market-driven and discrete items and using book value excluding AOCI and the impact of foreign currency remeasurement. This ROE reflects strong underlying business performance, bolstered by a net benefit that we would estimate at about 110 basis points from net favorable variances in comparison to our average quarterly expectations in a number of areas. These include the seasonal revenue pattern in our International businesses, pension risk transfer case experience, returns on non-coupon investments, and items that affected Corporate and Other results in the first quarter. I'll discuss the impact of these run rate items on the current quarter in reviewing our business results. Slide three presents the AOI impact of our assumption updates. This year's annual review of actuarial assumptions had a net favorable impact of $117 million on pre-tax adjusted operating income, or $0.17 per share. The most significant items are a $68 million benefit in Individual Life to adjust amortization and reserves, including the impact of a mortality experience update on legacy business; $31 million in Annuities, mainly driven by more favorable guaranteed minimum income benefit utilization experience; and $28 million in Group Insurance, primarily from more favorable disability claims resolution experience. As you'll recall, we moved up the annual actuarial review to the second quarter in order to have a refreshed view of our assumption update in place before the start of our year-end forecasting and capital planning cycle. Last year's review, completed in the third quarter, had a net unfavorable impact of $186 million on pre-tax adjusted operating income. Turning to slide four. The remainder of this quarter's list of market-driven and discrete items included in our results consists of only two items, with a net benefit to results of $0.12 per share. In the Annuities business, we released reserves for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits and adjusted DAC to affect market performance and future expectations, resulting in a benefit of $0.13 per share. And in Individual Life, we absorbed integration costs of about $0.01 per share related to The Hartford Life acquisition. The current quarter marks the substantial completion of the business integration and these costs. Over the two-and-a-half years since the acquisition, we have integrated the distribution platforms and product portfolios and achieved our targeted $90 million of annual run rate cost savings, with the full impact commencing in the third quarter of this year. Total integration costs amounted to $110 million or $10 million less than our original expectation. During the year-ago quarter, market-driven and discrete items produced a net charge of $0.02 per share. Moving to slide five. On a GAAP basis, our net income of $1.4 billion in the current quarter includes amounts characterized as net realized investment gains of $286 million and divested business results, and other items outside of adjusted operating income amounting to a pre-tax loss of $43 million comprised of the items you see on this slide. Of the larger items, product-related embedded derivatives and hedging activity had a positive impact of $510 million as the benefit from the increase in interest rates in the quarter was partially offset by the application of credit spreads to our gross GAAP liability for Variable Annuity living benefits. General portfolio and related activities mainly in our International operations resulted in net pre-tax gains of $405 million. And mark-to-market losses on derivatives, including those used to manage asset/liability durations with values that reflect changes in interest rates, had a negative impact of $728 million. The current quarter loss from divested businesses of $57 million mainly relates to long term care and includes interest rate-driven decreases in the market value of derivatives. Moving to our business results and starting on slide six, I'll discuss the comparative results excluding the market-driven and discrete items I have mentioned. Slide six highlights Individual Annuities. Annuities results were $423 million for the quarter, up $29 million from a year ago. Slide seven gives a view of our trend in earnings and return on assets. Most of our operating earnings in the Annuities business come from base contract charges linked to daily account values. The 7% earnings increase exceeded the growth of average account values from a year ago, resulting in a higher return on assets, or ROA, in the current quarter. ROA for the quarter was 105 basis points, up from 101 basis points in the year-ago quarter. Lower interest expense and more favorable base amortization factors in the current quarter contributed to the higher ROA. Looking back over the five quarters shown on the slide, I would note that ROA tends to vary within a range depending on the quarterly pattern of expenses and other non-linear items. Slide eight covers our Annuity sales. Our gross Variable Annuity sales for the quarter were $2.3 billion, compared to $2.7 billion in the year-ago quarter. Our risk diversification strategy has resulted in a dramatic change in the mix of new sales, with just over one-third of our new business for the current quarter adding to our net exposure to equity market linked Highest Daily, or HDI, living benefit guarantees, compared to 70% in the year-ago quarter. As we discussed on our Investor Day, effective on April 1, we entered into an agreement with Union Hamilton to reinsure approximately 50% of our HDI 3.0 optional living benefit risk on new business for this year and 2016, up to a maximum of $5 billion. This agreement will effectively convert about half of our sales with the HDI rider to sales without optional living benefits. During the current quarter, we reinsured the living benefit rider risk associated with about $550 million of the $1.4 billion of total HDI sales. In addition, we sold approximately $600 million of our Prudential Defined Income product, which directs a client's investment to a fixed income fund that we manage, and sales include about $350 million of products without a living benefit guarantee. Overall, only about one-third of our Variable Annuity sales in the quarter include living benefit riders with equity market exposure that we are retaining. Slide nine highlights the Retirement business. Earnings for the Retirement business amounted to $237 million for the current quarter, down by $49 million from $286 million a year ago. The decrease was driven by a $55 million lower contribution from net investment results. Current quarter returns from non-coupon investments were about $20 million below our average expectations, while the contribution to results for the year-ago quarter was about $10 million above our average expectations. Fixed income returns were also lower in the current quarter as the impact of lower earned rates on our institutional and full-service product portfolios more than offset the benefit of growth in our funded pension risk transfer business. The lower contribution from net investment results was primarily offset by a greater contribution from case experience on pension risk transfer business, which was about $25 million above our average quarterly expectation. Turning to slide 10. Total Retirement gross deposits and sales were $14.2 billion for the current quarter, compared to $6.6 billion a year ago. Standalone institutional gross sales were just over $9 billion in the current quarter compared to about $2 billion a year ago. Current quarter sales reflected the closing of four significant pension risk transfer transactions totaling about $7 billion, including roughly $5.5 billion of unfunded longevity reinsurance as well as $1.4 billion stable value wrap sale to an existing Group Life Insurance client. Full service gross sales and deposits, shown in the dark blue bars, were $5 billion for the quarter, up from $4.5 billion a year ago. As we have commented in the past, sales of both full service and institutional retirement products can fluctuate meaningfully on a quarterly basis. Total Retirement account values amounted to $373 billion at the end of the quarter, up by $42 billion or 13% from a year earlier, reflecting net flows of about $35 billion largely driven by longevity reinsurance and funded pension risk transfer business together with favorable market performance. Slide 11 highlights the Asset Management business. The Asset Management business reported adjusted operating income of $196 million for the current quarter compared to $200 million a year ago. While most of the segment's results come from asset management fees, the decrease in earnings from a year ago was driven by a $9 million lower contribution from incentive, transaction, strategic investing, and commercial mortgage activities. This contribution, which amounted to $24 million for the current quarter, is inherently variable since it reflects changing valuation and the timing of transactions. Asset management fees were $540 million for the current quarter, up by 7% from a year ago, largely tracking a 6% increase in unaffiliated third-party institutional and retail assets under management which totaled $471 billion at the end of the quarter. Net inflows over the past year amounted to $14 billion including $6.4 billion in the current quarter, which was largely driven by institutional fixed income mandates. The benefit of higher asset management fees was largely offset by higher expenses. The higher level of expenses in the current quarter includes variable compensation reflecting performance, including our $3 billion increase in unaffiliated third-party asset under management net flows compared to a year ago, investments we are making to build teams and infrastructure to expand our product and distribution capabilities, and higher upfront commissions associated with $2 billion increase in gross retail inflows for the quarter. Slide 12 highlights our U.S. Individual Life business. Individual Life earnings were $177 million for the current quarter, up by $11 million from a year ago. The increase in earnings was driven by more favorable claims experience in the current quarter including reserve updates, mortality, and related amortization. The contribution to current quarter results was about $30 million more favorable than our average expectation. This compares to a contribution from claims experience about $15 million more favorable than our average expectations a year ago on the same basis. The benefit to current quarter results for a more favorable claims experience was partly offset by a lower contribution from investment results and higher expenses, including distribution costs driven by increased sales. Slide 13 shows Individual Life sales based on annualized new business premiums, which amounted to $130 million for the current quarter, up by $27 million from a year ago. The higher level of sales reflects selective re-pricings to improve our competitive position where we saw opportunities to build business with appropriate returns, together with expanding distribution and product enhancements over the past year. The increase of $19 million in universal life sales was mainly driven by greater sales in selected age bands where we made pricing changes earlier this year to bring our rates more in line with the market. Term insurance sales in the gray bars are up $6 million from a year ago, with a continuing benefit from pricing changes we made last August. We also saw an increase in variable life sales driven partly by product enhancement. Slide 14 highlights the Group Insurance business. Group Insurance earnings amounted to $47 million in the current quarter, essentially unchanged from a year ago. Benefits from continued improvement in group disability claims experience and more favorable group life underwriting results were largely offset by higher expenses and a lower contribution from investment results. Slide 15 presents the trend of our Group Insurance benefit ratios after adjusting for the impact of the actuarial reviews in the current quarter and in the third quarter of last year. In group disability, favorable claims experience, mainly driven by resolutions of existing claims, produced an improvement of about eight percentage points in the benefit ratio from the year-ago quarter. While the benefit from the actions we've taken, including pricing adjustments and enhancements to our claims management process, is now evident over several quarters and we recognized the history of improvements in long term disability claims resolution in our assumption update, we continue to expect that claims experience will fluctuate from one quarter to another. The group life benefits ratio was near the favorable end of our expected range and improved from a year ago, including a benefit from fewer new claims. Moving to International Insurance. Slide 16 highlights our Life Planner operations. Earnings for our Life Planner business were $392 million for the quarter, up $10 million from a year ago. Excluding a $12 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates which reflect our hedging of yen income at \u00a591 (25:31) this year versus \u00a582 (25:33) a year earlier earnings are up by $22 million or 6%. Results benefited from continued business growth with insurance revenues including premiums, policy charges, and fees, up by 9% from a year ago on a constant dollar basis. The benefit to results from continued business growth was partly offset by higher expenses, including technology costs, and slightly less favorable mortality experience in the current quarter. Slide 17 highlights Gibraltar Life and Other operations. Earnings for Gibraltar Life were $471 million for the current quarter compared to $502 million a year ago. Excluding a negative impact of $26 million on the comparison from foreign currency exchange rates, results were essentially unchanged from a year ago. Higher net expenses in the current quarter largely driven by a benefit from fixed asset sales a year ago more than offset a greater current quarter contribution of about $20 million from investment results. The benefit to current quarter results from non-coupon investments and mortgage prepayment income was about $30 million above our average expectation. Slide 18 shows the quarterly pattern of earnings for our International Insurance businesses over the past seven quarters. Looking at the trend, you can see the seasonality pattern that favors the first half of the year, which results from a concentration of annual mode premium revenues for our Life Planner operations in the first quarter and for Gibraltar Life in the second quarter. We would estimate that this benefited current quarter earnings for Gibraltar Life by about $40 million in relation to a quarterly average. Turning to slide 19. International Insurance sales on a constant dollar basis were $777 million for the current quarter, up by $45 million, or 6%, from a year earlier. Sales by our Life Planners in Japan, shown in the dark blue bars, were $183 million in the current quarter, up $12 million, or 7%, from a year ago. The increase reflected a 5% greater Life Planner count, partly driven by our appointment of additional sales managers earlier in the year and higher agent productivity as measured by the number of policies sold per agent per month. At a product level, the increase came mainly from greater sales in term insurance. Life Planner sales outside of Japan were up $14 million from a year ago mainly driven by an increase in Brazil, where we've also grown Life Planner count meaningfully. Gibraltar's Life Consultant sales, shown in the light blue bars, amounted to $204 million in the current quarter, down by $16 million from a year ago. This decrease was driven by lower fixed annuity sales as our reductions of crediting rates we offer on new business, which are continually updated to reflect market interest rates, made these products relatively less attractive than other investment-focused alternatives in the market. Our fixed annuities have been popular among retiring teachers, many of whom are clients of our Life Consultants, for investment of lump-sum payouts upon retirement in the second quarter of the year. Sales through the bank channel, shown in the gray bars, amounted to $191 million for the current quarter, up $30 million, or 19% from a year ago. The increase was mainly driven by greater sales of U.S. dollar-denominated whole life insurance, reflecting broadening distribution among our Japanese bank relationships. Sales through independent agents, shown in the green bars, amounted to $81 million in the current quarter. The $5 million increase from a year ago was driven by greater sales of retirement products. Slide 20 shows the results of Corporate and Other operations. Corporate and Other operations reported a loss of $305 million for the current quarter compared to a $341 million loss a year ago. The reduction in the loss came mainly from lower expenses in the current quarter. Expenses in Corporate and Other are inherently variable and current quarter costs for items including deferred compensation programs and employee benefit plans were below recent averages, accounting for about half of the reduction in loss. An additional benefit from investment income on remaining assets that were formerly associated with our Closed Block business and initially transferred to Corporate and Other when we completed the restructuring of that business at the beginning of this year was largely offset by higher interest expense. Now I'll turn it over to Rob. Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Mark. I'll now provide you an update on some key items under the heading of financial strength and flexibility. Starting on slide 21. We continue to manage our insurance companies to levels of capital that we believe are consistent with AA standards. For Prudential Insurance, we manage to a 400% RBC ratio. As of year-end, Prudential Insurance reported an RBC ratio of 498%, with total adjusted capital, or TAC, of $15 billion. While we don't perform a quarterly bottoms-up RBC calculation, we estimate that our June 30 RBC ratio remains well above our 400% target after giving effect to results for the first half of the year, including a $2 billion dividend to the parent company in May following the completion of our Closed Block restructuring. In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margins of 844% and 882%, respectively, as of March 31, their fiscal year-end. These solvency margins are comfortably above our targets. Looking at our overall capital position on slide 22, we calculate our on-balance sheet capital capacity by comparing the statutory capital position of Prudential Insurance to our 400% RBC ratio target and then add capital capacity held in Japan and other operations and at the parent company. As of year-end, we estimated our available on-balance sheet capital capacity at approximately $2 billion on a net basis. This represented about $4 billion of gross capital capacity less $2 billion earmarked to reduce capital debt to arrive at our long-term targeted financial leverage ratio of 25%. Net capital capacity on the same basis increased to over $2.5 billion at the end of the first quarter. During the second quarter, our estimated on-balance sheet capital capacity increased to over $3 billion. The current quarter increase was mainly driven by capital generated by our businesses and changes in interest rates, which had a modest positive net impact on our capital position. These increases to capital capacity more than offset about $500 million of distributions including $250 million each from share repurchases and our $0.58 per share quarterly dividend. As I mentioned, during the quarter Prudential Insurance paid a $2 billion dividend to PFI, the holding company. As a result of that dividend as well as other sources of capital generated, we were able to reclassify about $2 billion from capital debt to operating debt as this debt is no longer supporting capital needs within our businesses. As our outstanding debt matures, all else equal, funds will be available at the holding company to reduce overall borrowings. As a result, our financial leverage ratio is now below our targeted level of 25% and there is no adjustment to earmark a portion of our capital capacity for reduction of capital debt to arrive at this target. Our overall level of borrowings is essentially unchanged from year-end and our total leverage ratio is down modestly, reflecting the increase in our equity. The fair value of the Japan equity hedge, after subtracting the remaining unsettled amount that we locked in during the first quarter and already included in capital capacity, was about $2.2 billion at June 30. Turning to the cash position at the parent company, cash and short-term investments net of outstanding commercial paper amounted to about $5.6 billion as of June 30. The cash in excess of our targeted $1.3 billion liquidity cushion is available to repay maturing operating debt, to fund operating needs, and to redeploy over time for strategic and capital management purposes. Now I'll turn it back over to John. John Robert Strangfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Rob. Thank you, Mark. And we'd now like to open it up to questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question will come from the line of Erik Bass with Citigroup. Your line is open. Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, thank you. I was hoping you could provide a little bit more detail around the drivers of the $500 million in improvement in excess capital, particularly the capital generated by the business. And maybe touch on any amounts from the settlements of the capital hedge that contributed to that. Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Erik, it's Rob. Happy to do so. As I said, the capital that we generated this quarter was primarily from business earnings and there was a modest benefit from interest rates. The math is relatively straightforward, if you think about the guidance that we've given before. If you look at our after-tax operating income, you net from that the buybacks and dividends that we provided during the course of the quarter, and the rule of thumb that we use for business growth that has the amount of capital that needs to be put back into our businesses to finance their growth, you come up with a number that's pretty close to the $0.5 billion that we generated. So it comes primarily from the earnings that are generated at the business level. The capital hedge \u2013 I presume in that case you're referring to the FX equity hedge, actually did not have a material impact in this quarter. If you recall in the first quarter, we accelerated some of the \u2013 locked in, I should say, some of the gains associated with that. And so that included most of what we otherwise would've realized during the course of this quarter. Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. And given the volatility that we've seen in the excess capital over the past three quarters, can you just talk about how comfortable you are in redeploying this capital? And does the volatility at all limit kind of your deployment options in terms of, I guess, how you would think about using that capital? Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think, Erik, the way I would respond to that is we had \u2013 I think the volatility was limited to a single quarter as opposed to volatility that you've seen on a consistent basis, first. Secondly, as we look at that capital capacity I think our inclination and philosophy toward redeployment has not changed. We look at holding a prudent amount of it to ensure that we retain and/or maintain a strong balance sheet and we otherwise look to redeploy that capital either to finance growth organically or inorganically and to keep a balanced distribution back to our shareholders as well. Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Just the final question. Given the recovery in the excess capital position and the uptick that we've seen in interest rates, have you given any consideration to either reducing or eliminating the rate under-hedge? Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We look at our interest \u2013 that particular under-hedge is looked at in the context of our overall interest sensitivity across the enterprise. At this point, we're comfortable with where we stand on that position. I think, as we've said before, we have a positive convexity toward interest rates, meaning that as rates rise we will benefit and we'll benefit more than we would suffer should rates decline. And we like that position at this point in the cycle. Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman : Yeah, this is Mark. Let me just remind you that you need to take a broader view of that. That narrow product under-hedge does go the other way from some other things in our income statement. And particularly in my remarks I commented on nearly $800 million of negative mark-to-market on basically duration hedging derivatives. And so you've got to think more generally about what goes the other way and how that's netted off before you start thinking about specifically the under-hedge as a standalone either view on rates or influence on our overall balance sheet. Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. Thank you for the comments. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss with Bank of America. Your line is open. Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, good morning and thank you. To follow up on the theme of capital, if we look at the parent company cash and short-term investment, $5.6 billion, I believe this is the highest it's been in about two and a half years. I understand excess capacity, you think about holistically in terms of HoldCo and the statutory entities, but given the higher parent company cash position, should we think of that as any type of short-term opportunity to deploy or are there near-term timing needs of cash that we should consider? Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Seth, I would point to the comment I made in my opening remarks about our leverage position, and specifically I would note that if you look forward to maturing operating debt that we've got during the course of this year, we've got about $2 billion worth of debt that matures in the second half of the year. We're sitting on a substantial amount, as you noted, cash at the holding company and we would expect to be able to pair those things off during the course of the year. Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. So is there no plan to roll those debts? Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We have a lot of liquidity sitting at the holding company, and we don't \u2013 we would not, based on our current position, think that we would want to add to that liquidity by effectively rolling over our existing debt rather than look at the opportunity to just repay that as it becomes due in its natural course. Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. Thanks. And if I could just follow up one in the Retirement segment. I think we've seen positive case experience in the pension closeouts for several quarters, or a couple years now. Perhaps you could just comment, maybe give a little bit more granularity on where that positive case experience is coming from and if that's something that \u2013 I know you're not guiding to anything sustainable there, you're being pretty specific about calling that out in both the releases and in earnings calls here, maybe just explain why that should normalize lower. Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit : Seth, this is Steve, I'll comment on that. I'm not going to attribute the positive case experience to any particular transactions or any particular part of the book. I will say that we call it out because we recognize that these are liabilities with longer average duration, about 9 years to 10 years on the funded side, as we spoke about, and about 8 years to 12 years on the longevity side. So we're not about to take the positive case experience and kind of bake it into our expectations, however, I will say that, as you pointed out, the consistent positive case experience does serve to bolster our already high confidence that we've priced this business appropriately and assessed the risks accurately. Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Maybe just to follow up in terms of just the kind of risk characteristics of this. Is this something that will have quarterly volatility like a group or life that maybe we're a little bit more accustomed to, and that it's just been several quarters of good luck, or is there may be just a better trend here that we could think about? Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit : Well, I wouldn't necessarily call it good luck. I'd call it, again, reflecting strong underwriting of the business. But, again, this would be something that we wouldn't expect to see the same type of number emerging from this every single quarter. Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. The first question I had is, Rob, when you take the 60% ratio of free cash flow versus GAAP earnings that you all have put out there, and then you compare it to the results you've had for the last few quarters, I get something closer to 90%. And so my question is, and I don't know if that would be precisely the way you would calculate it, but I think directionally that's right. Where is that, we'll call it above average or above expectations capital generation, where is that coming from right now? Is that something going on within the Arizona VA captive? Is that broadly related to interest rates? Can you just expand upon how you're over-earning from a cash flow generation standpoint right now? Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Tom, without benefiting from exactly how you're doing your calculations, I'd note a couple of things that have positively benefited our cash flow ratio, the most significant of which would be the Closed Block transaction. So as a result of that restructuring that we've talked about before, there's been a substantial freeing up of cash from the Closed Block business up to the parent holding company, and we've seen the benefit of that in our cash flow and, hence, that may be skewing the numbers that you're looking at. And, again, then depending on the timeframe that you're looking at, if you look at the positive convexity that I've mentioned that we have to interest rates, as interest rates have increased from their lows we have benefited from that and that frees up capital in a way that you don't see it coming necessarily from earnings, but from outside of earnings. Oh, and then I'm sorry, the one other point is the benefit from the yen hedge. So that's outside of our AOI number, but winds up. As we monetize that, we're able to get the cash from that and you've seen that, we've talked about that in the course of the first and second quarters, that yen has contributed to cash that has been available and is sitting at the holding company. The total of that, on an after-tax basis, in the first quarter we mentioned, was several hundred million dollars. And while it was not material in the second quarter, we've benefited from that in the cash position. Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And then just a follow up. The Closed Block transaction in terms of how much that moved the needle to your overall enterprise view of leverage and excess capital was how much? Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, the dividend this year was $2 billion from PICA, about $125 billion of that was associated with the Closed Block. So if you \u2013 you could do the math and figure out the attribution of that to our decline in the capital ratio. The decline in the financial ratio really came about by virtue of three things. That was the first. The second was we issued $1 billion of hybrids and 25% of that hybrid goes toward equity attribution and so that helps on the leverage ratio. And the third was just a growth in our earnings during the course of the quarter that increased the denominator. Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, thanks. And then just one last follow up. So I guess to get back on the question of interest rate sensitivity, overall capital position, would you guys be willing to provide sensitivities to this number which is now $3 billion in terms of balance sheet capital capacity, how much sensitivity is there if we were to see a \u2013 say, around year end this year, a decline in interest rates to either a 2% level on the 10-year treasury or 1.5%, is that something that you could help frame for us, because that's one of the main questions that I still get from people as to one of the concerns that they have. Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We have not provided direct sensitivities of capital to interest rates, Tom. I think what we did say on Investor Day is that we've run stresses and I think what we ran was a 50 basis point decline, 50 basis point to 100 basis point decline in our \u2013 in levels of interest rates and looked at what that would do to our capital capacity, and the result of that was a relatively modest impact to our capital capacity and just a slight elevation to our leverage ratio, so I would say that we feel reasonably comfortable that our capital capacity is sustainable in a declining interest rate environment. Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath at UBS. Your line is open. Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to start with Retirement, if I could. If I go back to the Investor Day, you showed a helpful slide that shows the profit emergence of PRT versus longevity transactions over time. So my question is, what is the relative size of those two businesses? I'm not sure if \u2013 what's the right way to do it in terms of reserves or capital or earnings, but can you give us some sense of, given the deal that you've announced today, the relative sizes of those two businesses? Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit : Suneet, this is Steve. I'll speak to the business that we've done in this quarter. As Mark mentioned in his comments, we had about $7 billion in sales in the quarter, of which about $1.5 billion was funded business and the remainder was in several different longevity transactions. In terms of the overall size of the book, we're looking for that data now and can provide it to you in due course. Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. And I guess my follow up question is just a follow up to Seth's on the $2 billion of debt that's maturing that you're going to repay. I haven't done the math on what the financial \u2013 the implications are for the financial leverage ratio if you repay that debt, but just based on where you sit today it would seem that you're going to be well below your 25% target that you use when you assess access capital capacity. So just wondering what the thought is there? Are we going to, at some point, see a reduction in that target from 25% to something lower? Or how should we think about that? Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : The debt reduction would actually be in the total leverage ratio would not affect our financial leverage ratio. So we've already re-characterized the debt that's to be repaid from financial to operating, so the $2 billion that's coming up will further reduce \u2013 will then repay operating debt. So our total financial ratio will decline from around 44% to around 42%, but there would be no impact on the reported financial ratio. Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. So you're still going to travel around that 25% target that you've talked about? Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's our targeted number and while we may bump above or below it, depending on any given quarter and particular situation that or opportunity that we're looking at, our intent is to have it hover around that number, yes. Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, thanks. Alan Mark Finkelstein - Senior Vice President & Head- Investor Relations : Suneet, let me just follow up on your question. If you look at page 18 of the QFS, we do break out total account values for longevity reinsurance and group annuities and other products, so you'll see those numbers there. Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. But is all that group annuity stuff PRT or are there other pieces in there? That's why I was - Alan Mark Finkelstein - Senior Vice President & Head- Investor Relations : Yeah, there are some other products and there's legacy PRT in there. Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. All right, I'll follow up later. Alan Mark Finkelstein - Senior Vice President & Head- Investor Relations : But you do see the longevity, which is essentially the U.K. longevity block that we've added over the last couple years. Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. I had a few questions. First on the FSA business, you've had positive flows now, I think for three straight quarters, so \u2013 and this quarter was especially good. So in the past, your outlook for the business and your view on market trends hasn't been that positive. I'm wondering if that's changed recently. And then on Group benefits, margins in both group life and disability seemed like they were unusually good. Not sure if it was an aberration or it's the result of pricing actions that you've taken and is this somewhat of a sustainable level in margins into the second half? Or would you expect margins to compress from these levels? Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit : Jimmy, this is Steve, I'll address both your questions. We think the full service flows that we've seen reflect the investments we've made in the business to be \u2013 to lower our unit costs and manage our unit costs more effectively and to improve our persistency and our sales pipeline. So we think that the \u2013 like I say, the sales we've seen reflect our enhancement of our competitive position. By the same token, we still view this as a highly competitive business and one in which sales and flows will be fairly chunky over time. This quarter's sales did not reflect any particularly large jumbo cases on either the sales or on the withdrawal side, but for example, in \u2013 it's been publicly announced, in July, we closed the State of Connecticut business, which was over $4 billion. So we still view this as something that will, like I say, have its ups and downs and that we see as a highly competitive business in which we're going to maintain our pricing discipline. On Group benefits ratios, I'd segment it out into life and disability. In life, we think the guidance we've given of a target range for the benefit ratio between 88% and 92% still holds. This was a good quarter, at the lower end of that range, but still within the range. On disability, we've given a similar range of 88% to 92%. Quite frankly, I do think that range is rather stale, as we see our successful efforts in remediation of the existing book and as we in particular see our successful efforts in improving our claims management capabilities. We think there's the potential for, as things settle down in our remediation of this business for revising that target ratio over time. I don't have a different type of figure for you yet, but I would expect that as we take a look at that, we'll come up with something that is in between the 88% to 92% range at the high-end and where we are today at the low-end. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then for Mark, on the Department of Labor fiduciary standards, how much of an impact do you expect the standards, if they are approved in final form similar to how the preliminary guidance was, how much of an impact would you see on your business and what are the specific product lines that you think will be the most affected? Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman : That's actually a question for Steve. Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit : Jimmy, I'll respond to that. I think some people have been asked on their calls do they see the DOL impact as a net-negative or a net-positive. We see it as a net-negative on the marketplace that we serve. We see the risk of individuals having restricted access to advice and certain types of solutions, in particular around guaranteed retirement income solutions. Just to give you a little bit of a flavor, the regulation itself is certainly voluminous and so is the industry commentary that has been made in response to the regulation. I think it's far too early to anticipate exactly what changes will ultimately be enacted and to give you an estimate of the impact of those changes. I can say that in our own comments, we highlighted a few different areas that really need clarification or outright amendment. To highlight a couple of those : like many in the industry, we believe that the fiduciary definition in the regulation, as drafted, is too broad, encompassing activities such as traditional marketing that were really never viewed as or intended to be fiduciary in nature. We also share concerns expressed by many others that the best interest contract exemption, as it's written and as it could be interpreted, would be highly problematic and could entail higher compliance burdens and costs and potentially higher legal exposures for industry participants. And we also highlighted where the DOL really needs to clarify and sharpen the distinction between education and advice. For us, in Prudential, as I highlighted on our last earnings call, we do believe that our market position, our mix of businesses, and the strength of our franchise will help us to adapt to any regulatory framework that emerges. We think that there are some aspects of our particular business model that benefit us in this regard. For example, most of our DC recordkeeping businesses is with cases with over 100 participants already, and that's relatively less impacted in this regulation. The investment platforms supporting both our Retirement and our Annuities businesses already operate on very much of an open architecture basis, and our own agency force, Prudential Advisors, sells a range of proprietary and non-proprietary products. So we think we're relatively well positioned to deal with an emerging regulatory framework. However, we still do view this, as I say, as something that has the potential for unintended negative consequences on the marketplace and the clients that we serve. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Eric Berg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks very much. I'd like to start by talking about the Retirement business. Just eyeballing the set of column charts on the right on slide 10. I'll let you get to that. It looks like the business, the real growth in the business is on the longevity reinsurance side as opposed to the funded side. Is that right? And if so, why are clients gravitating towards that option? Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit : Eric, this is Steve. I think we've seen growth on both fronts. I think that, naturally speaking, the longevity reinsurance business, being reinsurance activities at its core, tends to be in higher tickets, higher transaction sizes. But as we've spoken about before, both in terms of earnings attribution and in terms of capital attribution, the funded business has higher earnings per dollar of account value and higher capital attribution. In terms of the solutions and what kind of marketplace is developing more rapidly, I would say that the U.K. longevity reinsurance industry has been established for several years now. There's a regular stream of transactions in the marketplace in what has become a relatively well-established business. The pension risk transfer business on the funded basis in the U.S. tends to be more episodic in nature. We still view the business as having developed very nicely over the past couple of years, but particularly in the large case market in which we tend to do most of our business, that's naturally going to be episodic in nature. Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman : And, Eric, the longevity reinsurance transactions are more attractive to clients in the U.K. for structural and cost reasons. In the U.S., we've actually done much better on the fully funded deals. So it's not that clients choose one or the other, you're kind of seeing two different places here. Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit : Yeah, the longevity reinsurance business really has not yet emerged in the U.S. Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Before turning to a question about Annuity, I just want to ask one quick one further about Retirement. Just to make sure I understand what exactly we mean by case experience here being favorable. Is the idea plainly and simply that deaths of plan participants are happening at a greater rate than you priced for, so you're ceasing payments to annuitants sooner than you priced for it, is that what you mean by favorable case experience? Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit : That's primarily it, Eric. There's also an impact from investment experience as well. Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : One last question regarding the Annuity business and I'll be wrapped up. One of the things I noticed in your supplement is that despite the \u2013 what has now been a multi-quarter effort to de-risk the Annuity business, the relationship between the two sets of account values, those with higher risk and those with less risk, whether they're reinsured or don't have equity risk, hasn't really changed, that's what at least I'm taking away from the supplement. Is that right? And if so, why hasn't this ratio changed? Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit : Well, Eric, I think on that front \u2013 this is Steve, again \u2013 it's just more a matter of the math. We have a very large in-force book and we have embarked on this product diversification effort for basically two years now. We've had, I think, remarkable success in altering our sales pattern over those two years, as Mark highlighted in his business commentary. But the plain mathematical fact of the matter is that it will take time for that altered sales pattern to have a significant impact on the nature of the in-force. Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Very good. I'm all set. Thanks very much. Alan Mark Finkelstein - Senior Vice President & Head- Investor Relations : Cynthia, we'll take one more question, please. Operator : Certainly. And that will be the line of Michael Kovac with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Michael E. Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'm just wondering, on the assumption review this quarter, if you could walk us through in a little more detail relative to last year what some of the underlying changes that you made were and specifically thinking about long-term and shorter term interest rate assumptions embedded in some of your products. Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Michael, it's Rob, I'll try to tackle that. First, let me answer the latter part of it. We actually brought down our long-term reversion rate, both in the U.S. and Japan, by 25 basis points, and that had a negative impact on our assumption update for the year. Offsetting that were positive drivers that we had. And if I had to sort of summarize them across the businesses, it would be that mortality was a positive impact both in our Life and Corporate and Other business. The annuity utilization rates, specifically on our GMIB product, was a positive impact, and then we had a positive impact from long-term disability termination rates. If you look at the AOI impact of that, I think as Mark highlighted, that was a positive of about $117 million, but importantly on a GAAP net income basis it was also a positive of about $60 million, and so while it had less of a positive impact on a GAAP basis we nonetheless had a positive outcome there as well. Did that answer your question without getting into specifics on any individual business? Happy to do so if you're looking for more detail. Michael E. Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah, I can follow up on the individual businesses. I was looking at the rate level. And then one more question on the Annuities business, I think you might have (63:19) run rate for this, you called out some of the one-time items but is scale really driving this to a more reasonable maybe $425 million (63:28) run rate on a quarterly basis, and that's part one on the Annuities. And then second, when you think about sales going forward with now the reinsurance in place, do you expect to be able to accelerate the pace of sales in this business going forward? Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit : Michael, it's Steve. I'll tackle that. In regard to how we view a run rate for the business, I'd guide you to my comments that I made earlier about ROA. We're pleased with the progress on that front, but we still view this as a business where the sustainable ROA over time will be in the low-100-basis points ranging up to 105 basis points. In regard to reinsurance, we view that as a risk management initiative and tool. We do not see it as something that we intend to use to lever up our HDI sales. That's not how we view it at all. We continue to price our HDI product without regard to the reinsurance contract, for example. And conduct ourselves in the market accordingly. So I really emphasize that the reinsurance arrangement is purely a risk management tool, one of several at our disposal. Michael E. Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you.

John, I'll hand it over to you. John Robert Strangfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Prudential reported solid third quarter results and we are well on track to achieve the financial objectives we set out for the year. Operating EPS, excluding market driven and discrete items, is $2.52, in line with what we reported last year, which benefited from higher non-coupon investment income. Our annualized ROE for the quarter on that same basis is just over 14%, modestly above our long-term 13% to 14% objective. Overall, we benefited from good core growth in many of our businesses and strong underwriting margins across our domestic and international insurance operations. This helped mitigate the impacts of weakening foreign currencies and some pressure on investment spreads. Non-coupon investment income was modestly below our average expectations for the quarter and our U.S. businesses also continue to see some impacts on core spreads from persistent low rates. Mark and Rob will walk through the specifics of our key drivers, results and capital position. I'll provide some higher level observations on our businesses. To start, our international businesses had very strong sales results, up 12% over the prior year on a constant currency basis. And the growth was broad-based. Our life planner business experienced double-digit sales growth, including 12% in Japan. And Gibraltar grew nicely in all three distribution channels. And while it was a good quarter for sales, we are particularly encouraged by the core growth drivers underlying our sales figures. The life planner count grew 6% over the prior year in Japan and we exceeded 1,000 life planners in our Brazil operation in the quarter. At Gibraltar, we continue to see stabilization in our life planner count and life consultant count at higher productivity levels, and have shown success expanding our bank channel footprint, all while emphasizing the death protection products where we are best able to achieve our targeted margins. We are also pleased with the results we saw in our U.S. business. Our retirement business provided positive net flows of about $2 billion in the quarter, benefiting from a large-case sale in full service. We did not execute any large pension transfer transaction in the quarter. As we have mentioned in the past, this is a business where transaction activity is inevitably lumpy. As a case in point, we look forward to completing two recently announced funded transactions in the fourth quarter, JCPenney and Philips U.S. The pension risk transfer business continues to produce favorable underwriting results and we see good opportunities for long-term growth as we have highlighted in the past. Asset management also produced positive net flows at over $3 billion in the quarter. Our investment performance remains strong and we continue to invest in capabilities, people, and distribution to take advantage of our opportunity to organically grow this business long term. Sales in our annuity business are down year over year and sequentially, reflecting mainly discipline around product features and pricing. However, we continue to show success with our diversification efforts, which include the benefit from our reinsurance contract with Union Hamilton, which transfers about half of our living benefit rider exposure on our HDI product sales. Our U.S. individual life and group insurance businesses both performed well in the quarter. We produced strong sales growth in individual life insurance, up 63% over the prior year, benefiting from recent product and pricing actions and some larger policy sales in the quarter. Earnings also benefited from another quarter of favorable mortality experience, compared to our average expectations, as we have experienced in 10 out of the last 12 quarters. And in group insurance, we remain pleased with the continued progress we are making in improving our disability underwriting margins, as we had a solid performance in both group life and disability. And finally, our capital position remains strong and continues to support a healthy capital return to our shareholders. This includes deployment of approximately $500 million this quarter through our dividend and share repurchase program. Since the beginning of 2010, we have returned nearly $9 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks, which is above and beyond the capital deployed to support organic growth and M&A. Looking forward, we continue to feel very good about our prospects. Now, like others, we are clearly impacted by headwinds such as persistent low interest rates and the potential for ongoing market volatility, and we are also impacted over the near term by weakening foreign currencies, though we have longer term mitigants. And additionally we are investing in technology and growth opportunities that have a payback over a multi-year timeframe. On the regulatory front, we continue to play a highly active and constructive role, working with domestic and international regulatory bodies, including as it relates to capital frameworks. And while the progress is ongoing, we remain encouraged by the dialogue on several topics, such as our interactions with the Federal Reserve on group supervision, and the NAIC with respect to the early progress on the issue of variable annuity asset and liability statutory valuations. Now, back to the quarter, for one final concluding comment before handing it over to Mark. We saw this quarter, in a period of significant market volatility, the resilience of our businesses and earnings, benefiting from successful execution and innovation, over many years, that have resulted in a differentiated franchise that produces strong ROEs and significant excess capital over time. With that, I will now hand it over to Mark. Mark? Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman : Thank you, John. Good morning, good afternoon, or good evening. I will take you through our results and then I will turn it over to Rob Falzon, who will cover our capital and liquidity pictures. On slide 2, I'll start with an overview of our financial results for the quarter. On a reported basis, common stock earnings per share amounted to $2.40 for the third quarter, based on after-tax adjusted operating income. This compares to EPS of $2.20 a year ago. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items in both the current quarter and the year-ago quarter, EPS was essentially flat compared to a year ago, as a few inherently variable items offset business growth and favorable underwriting results. I'll mention a few highlights of our business performance that affected the comparison to a year ago. First, we continued to produce solid business growth in our international life planner business on a constant currency basis, and in our U.S. businesses, including Individual Life, where we have been growing profitable books of universal life and term insurance. And second, we produced solid underwriting results in our U.S. and international insurance protection businesses, including improved experience in group insurance compared to a year ago and favorable case experience in our pension risk transfer business. These benefits were offset by three primary items. One, a lower contribution from net investment results with returns on non-coupon investments below our average expectations in the current quarter. In contrast, in the year-ago quarter, the contribution was well above expectations. Two, higher net expenses in several businesses, and three, less favorable currency exchange rates in international insurance. I would also note that both the current quarter and the year ago quarter benefited from true-ups of our effective tax rates to full year expectations. For the current quarter, the benefit to earnings per share is about $0.05. On a GAAP basis, including amounts categorized as realized investment gains or losses and results from divested businesses, we reported net income of $1.5 billion for the current quarter. This compares to $465 million a year ago, which included a non-AOI charge related to our annual actuarial review, which we completed last year in the third quarter, as well as the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rate re-measurement, which we have taken steps to mitigate. Book value per share amounted to $73.19 at the end of the third quarter, up $8.44 from yearend after the payment of three quarterly dividends totaling $1.74 per share. This is excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, and after adjusting the numbers to remove the impact of foreign currency exchange rate re-measurement. Annualized ROE for the first nine months of the year, based on after-tax adjusted operating income, excluding market-driven and discrete items, and book value excluding AOI and the impact of foreign currency re-measurement, was 15.2%. This ROE reflects strong underlying business performance bolstered by a net benefit that we would estimate at about 80 basis points from net favorable variances in comparison to our average quarterly expectations that we've called out in a number of areas, mainly during the first half of the year. These primarily include mortality and pension risk transfer case experience, the seasonal revenue pattern in our international insurance businesses and returns on non-coupon investments. I'll discuss the impact of notable run rate items on the current quarter in reviewing our business results. In thinking about our earnings pattern, I would also note that historically, in each of the past three years, a number of our businesses have had higher than average expenses in the fourth quarter, including the impact of seasonal items such as annual policyholder mailings. Turning to slide 3, we have a short list of market-driven and discrete items included in our results for the current quarter, with a net unfavorable impact of $0.12 per share. In the annuities business, charges, mainly driven by adjustments in reserves for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits and DAC to reflect market performance, amounted to $0.15 per share. And in retirement, reserve refinements related to systems enhancements resulted in a net benefit of $0.03 per share. During the year-ago quarter, market-driven and discrete items produced a net charge of $0.34 per share. This was mainly driven by our annual actuarial review, which we moved up to the second quarter commencing this year. Moving to slide 4, on a GAAP basis, our net income of $1.5 billion in the current quarter includes amounts characterized as net realized investment gains of $438 million and divested business results and other items outside of adjusted operating income, amounting to pre-tax income of $146 million, comprised of the items you see on this slide. Of the larger items, mark-to-market on derivatives mainly related to management of asset and liability durations and currency exposures, resulted in a $304 million pre-tax gain. General portfolio and related activities, mainly in our international operations, resulted in net pre-tax gains of $295 million. And impairments and credit losses amounted to $166 million in the quarter. While impairments have increased in the current quarter from recent levels, we haven't seen significant signs of credit deterioration in our investment portfolio. The majority of the current quarter impairments relate to equity holdings and were taken based on length of time with unrealized losses. The current quarter income from divested businesses of $116 million mainly represents results of the Closed Block. Moving to our business results, and starting on 5, I'll discuss the comparative results excluding the market-driven and discrete items that I have mentioned. Slide 5 highlights individual annuities. Annuities results were $414 million for the quarter, up by $11 million from a year ago. The earnings increase from a year ago came mainly from lower interest expense. Most of our operating earnings in the annuities business come from base contract charges linked to daily account values. Policy charges and fees are down about 2% from a year ago, tracking the decline in average account values, which was largely driven by the equity market downturn in the current quarter. The decline in fees was largely offset by lower distribution costs and base amortization. Slide 6 gives a view of our trend in earnings and return on assets in the annuity business. Return on assets for the quarter was 105 basis points, roughly in line with the first two quarters of this year. The increase from 101 basis points in the year-ago quarter came mainly from lower interest expense and more favorable base amortization factors in the current quarter. Return on assets can vary within a range, depending on the quarterly pattern of expenses and other non-linear items. Slide 7 presents our annuity sales. Our gross variable annuity sales for the quarter were $2.1 billion, compared to $2.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. The decline in sales mainly reflects measures we have taken to improve the risk profile of our products and maintain appropriate returns. During the current quarter, we reinsured the living benefit rider risk on about $500 million of our $1.2 billion of total highest daily or HDI sales, under the agreement we entered with Union Hamilton, effective on April 1 of this year. This agreement, which provides for reinsurance of about 50% of our HDI 3.0 optional living benefit risk, on most new business for 2015 and 2016, up to a maximum of $5 billion, will effectively convert about half of our sales with the HDI rider to new business that looks like it doesn't have optional living benefit exposure. Sales of just under $600 million of our Prudential defined income product, which directs the clients' investment to a fixed income fund which we manage, and sales of about $300 million of products without living benefit guarantees also contributed to our mix diversification. Overall, our efforts to diversify our variable annuity exposure are showing success as the majority of our current quarter sales didn't add to our net exposure to equity-market-linked HDI living benefit guarantees. Slide 8 highlights the retirement business. Earnings for the retirement business amounted to $222 million for the current quarter, down $47 million from $269 million a year ago. The decrease was driven by a $48 million lower contribution from net investment results. Current quarter returns from non-coupon investments were about $10 million below our average expectations, while the contribution to results for the year ago quarter was about $35 million above our average expectations. Fixed income spread was essentially unchanged from a year ago, as the benefit of growth in our funded pension risk transfer business was largely offset by lower earned rates in our full service portfolio. Lower fees on full service business, reflecting fee pressures over the past year, and higher expenses in the first quarter essentially offset a greater contribution from pension risk transfer case experience, driven by favorable underwriting results and by growth. The current quarter contribution from case experience was about $10 million above our average expectations. Turning to slide 9, total retirement gross deposits and sales were $11.5 billion for the current quarter, compared to $36.2 billion a year ago, which included $29 billion for two significant longevity reinsurance transactions. Net flows for the current quarter were $2.4 billion. Full service gross sales and deposits shown in the dark blue bars were $9.4 billion for the quarter, up from $5.2 billion a year ago. Current quarter sales included a major case win for $4.7 billion that we closed in July covering the state of Connecticut's employee retirement plan. Standalone institutional gross sales were about $2 billion in the current quarter, largely unchanged from a year ago, excluding the longevity reinsurance transactions I mentioned earlier. The contribution to sales from investment-only stable value wraps, shown in the light blue bar, was $1.2 billion in the current quarter, more than double the year ago level, with the increase mainly driven by participant add-ons in existing accounts. As we have commented in the past, sales of both full service and institutional retirement products can fluctuate meaningfully on a quarterly basis. Total retirement account values amounted to $366 billion at the end of the quarter, up by $10 billion or 3% from a year earlier, reflecting net flows of about $9 billion over the past year, with market performance essentially neutral. Slide 10 highlights the asset management business. The asset management business reported adjusted operating income of $180 million for the current quarter, compared to $200 million a year ago. While most of the segment's results come from asset management fees, the decrease from a year ago was mainly driven by a $14 million lower contribution from incentive, transaction, strategic investing and commercial mortgage activities. This contribution is inherently variable since it reflects changing valuations and the timing of transactions. And it amounted to $22 million for the current quarter, about $10 million below the average of the preceding eight quarters. The benefit from continued growth of asset management fees was offset by higher expenses in the current quarter. The higher level of expenses included start-up costs for new real estate funds, greater mutual fund distribution costs, reflecting sales mix, and continued investment in our teams and infrastructure. Asset management fees were $536 million for the current quarter, up 5% from a year ago, tracking a 5% increase in unaffiliated third party institutional and retail assets under management, which totaled $465 billion at the end of the quarter. Net inflows over the past quarter amounted to $17 billion, including $3 billion in the current quarter, which was driven by strong institutional fixed income flows. Slide 11 highlights our U.S. individual life business. Individual life earnings were $183 million for the current quarter, up $15 million from a year ago. The increase in earnings was mainly driven by growth of our book of universal life and term insurance. Over the past year, annualized new business premiums for these products totaled about $460 million, contributing to growth of our business in force and an increase of $23 million, or 3%, in individual life revenues from premiums, policy charges and fee income after adjusting for the impact of our annual actuarial review a year ago. Claims experience, including mortality, reserve updates and related amortization was favorable in both the current quarter and the year-ago quarter, with the contribution of current quarter results about $25 million greater than our average expectations. Slide 12 shows individual life sales based on annualized new business premiums, which amounted to $158 million for the current quarter, up $61 million from a year ago, with increases in each of our major product groups. The increase of $39 million in universal life sales was mainly driven by greater sales in selected age bands where we made pricing changes earlier this year to bring our rates more in line with the market. Variable life sales in the green bars are up by $15 million from a year ago, reflecting several large cases in the current quarter. Slide 13 highlights the group insurance business. Group insurance earnings amounted to $44 million in the current quarter, up by $10 million from a year ago. The increase came mainly from more favorable Group Life underwriting results. An improvement in group disability insurance was largely offset by lower earned premiums on that business. Slide 14 presents a timeline of our group insurance benefits ratios after adjustment for the impact of our actuarial reviews and other refinements. In comparing our benefits ratios for the current and year-ago quarters to the historical results shown on the left side of the slide, you can see the impact of actions we have taken in group disability to bring these ratios to an acceptable level while maintaining pricing discipline in group life. Through the current quarter, we have repriced or allowed to lapse over 80% of our group disability business that was on the books three years ago. Generally implementing mid- to high-single-digit price increases and we have enhanced our claims management processes over that period. The group life benefits ratio for the current quarter was near the favorable end of our expected range and improved about 1 percentage point from a year ago, with a smaller average claim size and lower new claim count. As I mentioned, the current quarter group disabilities benefits ratio also improved from a year ago. While the benefit of the actions we have taken has now been evident over several quarters, we continue to expect that claims experience will fluctuate from one quarter to another. Moving now to international insurance, highlighted on slide 15, earnings for our life planner business was $398 million for the quarter, essentially unchanged from a year ago. Excluding a $14 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, which reflect our hedging of yen income at 91 in 2015 versus 82 a year earlier, life planner earnings are up $15 million or 4%. We have substantially completed the hedging of our expected yen earnings for 2016 and our hedging rate for next year is expected to be 106 yen per U.S. dollar. Current quarter Life Planner results benefited from continued business growth, with insurance revenues including premiums, policy charges, and fees growing by 11% from a year ago on a constant dollar basis. The benefit to results from continued business growth was partially offset by higher expenses, including costs to enhance our agency distribution infrastructure in Japan and costs for technology, as part of an ongoing process. Mortality experience was favorable in relation to our average expectations in both the current quarter and the year-ago quarter. Slide 16 highlights Gibraltar Life and other operations. Earnings for Gibraltar Life were $414 million for the current quarter, compared to $446 million a year ago. Excluding a negative impact of $19 million on the comparison from foreign currency exchange rates, results were down by $13 million from a year ago. This decrease was driven by a lower net contribution (27:19 \u2013 27:22) benefit to current quarter results from non-coupon investments and mortgage prepayment income was roughly in line with our average expectations, but below the level of a year ago. The lower contribution from these variable items was partly offset by higher fixed income returns, reflecting changes in portfolio mix. Turning to slide 17, international insurance sales on a constant-dollar basis were $798 million for the current quarter, up by $88 million or 12% from a year ago. Each of our distribution channels, life planners, Gibraltar life consultants, banks and independent agencies contributed to the increase, and we benefited from sales growth in Japan, as well as other key markets. Sales by our life planners in Japan, shown in the dark blue bars, were $199 million in the current quarter, up $21 million or 12% from a year ago. The increase reflected a 6% greater life planner count, partly driven by an increase in our number of sales managers. At a product level, the increase came mainly from greater sales of term insurance, and to a lesser extent whole life, which included a modest amount of accelerated purchases in anticipation of an announced price increase for single premium products. Life planner sales outside of Japan were up by $15 million from a year ago, mainly driven by an increase in Brazil where we have also grown life planner count meaningfully and we surpassed the milestone of 1,000 agents in Brazil in the third quarter. Gibraltar's life consultant sales, shown in the light blue bars, amounted to $199 million in the current quarter, up by $13 million, or 7%, from a year ago, reflecting higher agent productivity as measured by number of policies sold per agent per month. At the product level, the increase was mainly driven by greater sales of whole life products. Sales through the bank channel, shown in the gray bars, amounted to $208 million for the current quarter, up by $35 million or 20% from a year ago. The increase was mainly driven by greater sales of recurring premium death protection products, most significantly 10-pay [29:48] and longer, reflecting broadening distribution among our Japanese bank relationships and the attractiveness of these products in the estate planning or inheritance market. Sales through independent agents, shown in the green bars, amounted to $72 million in the current quarter. The $4 million increase from a year ago was driven by greater term insurance sales. Slide 18 shows the results of corporate and other operations. Corporate and other operations reported a loss of $308 million for the current quarter, compared to a $320 million loss a year ago. The corporate and other loss includes a number of items that are inherently variable and the reduction in loss compared to a year ago reflects some favorability in the current quarter. For example, we benefited about $20 million from a reinsurance settlement in the current quarter. Now I'll turn it over to Rob. Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Mark. I'm going to give you an update on some key items under the heading of financial strength and flexibility. Starting on slide 19. We continue to manage our insurance companies to levels of capital that we believe are consistent with AA standards. For Prudential Insurance, we manage to a 400% RBC ratio. At the end of last year, Prudential Insurance reported an RBC ratio of 498% with total adjusted capital, or TAC, of $15 billion. While we don't perform a quarterly bottoms-up RBC calculation, we estimate that our September 30 RBC ratio remains well above our 400% target, after giving effect to the results for the first nine months of the year, including a $2 billion dividend to the parent company in May following the completion of our closed block restructuring. In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margins of 853% and 927%, respectively, as of June 30. We're managing these companies to solvency margins of 600% to 700%, which we believe is consistent with AA balance sheet strength and we are comfortably above our targets. Looking at our overall capital position on slide 20, we calculate our on-balance sheet capital capacity by comparing the statutory capital position of Prudential Insurance to our 400% RBC ratio target, and then add capital capacity held in Japan and other operations and at the parent company. As of the end of last year, we estimated our available on-balance sheet capital capacity at approximately $2 billion on a net basis. This represented about $4 billion on a gross basis, less $2 billion earmarked to reduce capital debt, to arrive at our long-term targeted financial leverage ratio of 25%. During the first nine months of this year, we returned about $1.5 billion to shareholders. These returns included three quarterly common stock dividends totaling about $800 million and the repurchase of $750 million of our common stock. Our financial leverage ratio, which is based on capital debt, decreased from 29.3% at yearend to 25.5% at the end of the third quarter. The reduction of financial leverage reflected our receipt of the $2 billion dividend from Prudential Insurance that I mentioned, together with capital generated from other sources, which reduced the need to support capital requirements in our businesses with debt. At the end of the third quarter, we've made a minor adjustment to earmark a portion of our capital capacity for a reduction of capital debt to arrive at our target level of 25%. After giving effect to that adjustment, our capital capacity stood at over $3 billion. This compares to about $2 billion at yearend and is consistent with the greater than $3 billion that we disclosed at June 30. Our financial leverage ratio increased from 23.9% at June 30 to 25.5% at September 30. This reflects an increase in our level of capital debt of about $600 million, as the fallen interest rates and just over $200 million in net hedging costs, reflecting market volatility, resulted in a funding need at our variable annuity captive reinsurer. Our total leverage ratio, which includes all borrowings, also came down from 45.1% at year end to 42.8% at September 30, below our targeted level of 45%, as we applied cash held at the parent company to repay external debt maturing during the third quarter. The fair value of the Japan equity hedge, which is not included in our capital capacity, was about $2 billion at September 30. Turning to the cash position at the parent company, cash and short-term investments net of outstanding commercial paper amounted to about $4.2 billion as of September 30. The cash in excess of our targeted $1.3 billion liquidity cushion is available to repay maturing operating debt, to fund operating needs and to deploy over time for strategic and capital management purposes. Now, I'll turn it back over to John. John Robert Strangfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Rob. So, let's open it up for Q&A. Operator : Certainly. Our first question will come from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, first a question for Rob on capital. Could you discuss the impact that the drop in interest rates had on your capital position? And then you've talked about \u2013 talked in the past about reducing your sensitivity \u2013 the sensitivity of capital to interest rates. Maybe go into a little bit of detail on what are some of the things you are doing to do that? Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay, Jimmy, so referring back to the \u2013 to my introductory remarks, if you think about the capital debt going up by around $600 million, that had two principal components to it. First was the breakage on our hedging within the VA captive. And the second piece of that was largely driven by the interest rate movements during the course of the quarter. If you looked at our capital capacity at the end of the quarter, and you did not adjust for it \u2013 you didn't increase our leverage ratio \u2013 we would still have had capital capacity above the $3 billion, consistent with the \u2013 with what I articulated. So interest rates clearly had an impact during the course of the quarter, but we would characterize it as relatively modest in terms of the overall impact on our capital capacity. I think as we've talked about before, with regard to the sensitivity to interest rates, we think about management of our capital as a \u2013 sorry, we think of management of interest rate risk in what you would consider to be normal levels of volatility as something that we would hold capital against. So, you would see some movement in our capital capacity as a result of normal volatility, quarter to quarter, in interest rates. However, what we do is outside of that range of normal volatility, we look to hedge out the risk and think of it as in the tails at (37:29) outcomes for interest rates, such that our capital capacity would be preserved in more extreme outcomes Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And on the $600 million that you mentioned, I think the VA hedge breakage was around $200 million, which would imply that the rate impact was less than $0.5 billion, in that neighborhood, right? Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I'm not sure I'm following your numbers, Jimmy. When you say the VA hedge breakage, you're talking about the hedge target breakage? Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah, yeah. Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, so \u2013 well, that was in the \u2013 from the $600 million, that hedge breakage was the $200ish million that I deducted from that $600 million. So, the residual $400 million would have been net everything else, interest rates included in there. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then just one last question on pension closeout deals, your experience on the deals has been better than what you have, I guess, priced for, and \u2013 but there has been a lot of talk about pricing and margins on deals that are being done in Europe and the press and the sort of \u2013 some of the articles implied that pricing has gotten aggressive. What's your view on the return potential of the business that you've done in Europe versus what you're doing in the US? Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit : Jimmy, this is Steve. I'll speak to that. We remain very confident about our pricing of these transactions, both in terms of what we've already written and also the experience we are having as we pursue additional transactions. In regard to some of the recent press commentary, I'd give our perspective as follows. We participate as a reinsurer working with primary UK insurers in the longevity business. We see that global market structure as having a couple of key benefits. We think that that market structure provides additional capacity to UK plan sponsors looking to manage longevity risk and we also think that global structure provides additional protection to UK plan participants in terms of the pension promises that have been made to them. So we view this market structure as having a lot of benefits for all parties involved. In terms of the business that we write and how we price it, we apply a very robust economic capital framework that drives our pricing and supports the business with prudent capital standards. We put this framework through significant and continuous stress testing and it's the same model we use for domestic deals. And then finally, I'd just mention something that you've heard from us before, just a reminder that our PRT pricing, both funded and unfunded, does not take into account any enterprise-level benefits around risk diversification or longevity mortality netting. So, like I say, we remain quite confident in our pricing. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Your line is open. Jay H. Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. My first question was on pension risk transfer. What are the deposit amounts we should expect for Prudential from JCPenney and Philips U.S. in 4Q? Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit : Jay, this is Steve again. I'll cover that. The deposit amounts that will emerge from JCPenney have yet to be determined. That deal is operating on a variable structure. We expect it will be between $0.5 billion and $1.5 billion. Regarding Philips U.S., the total transaction is $1.1 billion. Our share of that will be $450 million. I will also point out that on Philips U.S., we are the account administrator for all retirees and will be receiving additional consideration for providing that service on the entire retiree block. Jay H. Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's $450 million, not euros, right? Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit : Oh, yes, correct. This is the Philips U.S. business. Jay H. Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Can you talk about the pipeline for pension risk transfer looking out? Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit : We feel the pipeline remains, and is, quite solid. I think what we've been seeing over the past year and continue to see, Jay, is that the pipeline is really being driven by secular trends. We are looking at, for example, the updated mortality tables are really having an impact in terms of accentuating awareness of longevity risk and desire to manage it. Also, continuous increasing of PBGC premiums also has an effect. So all of these factors contribute to what we see as a very healthy pipeline going forward. Jay H. Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: It's been several years since we've seen a significant jumbo deal come to market for Prudential. Is the pipeline strong for those types of deals as well? Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit : Those obviously are \u2013 while PRT inherently is lumpy, those real jumbo deals are even lumpier. So discussions continue, but we'll see what unfolds. In regard to several years, Jay, I would just point out that on the longevity side, at least, we did have a deal that is jumbo by any standard in mid-2014. Jay H. Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Of course. Thank you. Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Dally with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. First, on variable annuities, I would be interested in your views as to how the recent NAIC proposals as it relates to captors may impact you. And then second, in your comments you made the comment that expenses tend to be seasonally higher in the fourth quarter. Any reason to believe the impact this year will be any different, and is it possible to quantify that seasonal impact? Thanks. Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's Rob, Nigel. Let me handle the first question. The \u2013 with respect to the variable annuities work, first let me step back and go through with you some of the things that we said at Investor Day. We went through the reasons during the course of our presentation as to why we reinsured our VA rider to a captive. Those reasons related to the disconnect between stat accounting and the risk management tools that we use in order \u2013 or to manage the rider. Also recall that we hold capital to CTE 97 and that we have reserves in our captives that are almost two times the reserves that would be required \u2013 that we would otherwise be required to hold at the seeding company. We're constantly evaluating that construct, making sure that we're managing risk on an economic basis, and in addition to that, we're looking at the implications of that on capital and liquidity, on accounting, both from a statutory and a GAAP standpoint and also on hedging efficiency. So consistent with that objective, we've been, as you can imagine, highly engaged in the conversation with the NAIC with Oliver Wyman and with others in the industry. And what I would say is that \u2013 what we would say is that all of the right issues are on the table and are being discussed. We're encouraged by the dialogue. It could produce both a good outcome for companies and regulators, but I would also say that these are still early days in what is likely to be a fairly long process Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit : And Nigel, I'll take your question regarding seasonality of expenses. The annuities business is definitely one of those businesses that Mark mentioned where we see quarterly seasonality. And while I'm not going to offer a quantification of what we'll see in the fourth quarter, if you take a look at last year's fourth quarter, you saw that impact and I see no reason to believe that we won't be seeing that same seasonality in this year's 4Q. Charlie F. Lowrey - Chief Operating Officer-International & EVP: And Nigel, on the international side, I would say the same thing. Obviously, expenses vary quarter to quarter depending upon a variety of factors, one of which is, of course, seasonality. And we see that in international in the fourth quarter every year, because in the fourth quarter you have additional administrative costs including annual mailings to customers. And that doesn't sound like a lot, except in Japan, for instance, we have 10 million policies and over 3 million mailings that we do. In addition, there are in international discretionary costs that we incur later in the year, depending upon budgets, and often systems initiatives are concentrated to finish by the end of the year. So there's additional spending in the fourth quarter and we'd expect that pattern to continue this year. Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So \u2013 it's Rob, and let me pull those two pieces together. If you looked at our historical pattern of sort of fourth quarter total overhead expenses as contrasted to the prior three quarters, what you would find is that somewhere between 5% and 10% is sort of the level of increase that you will find in the fourth quarter, vis-\u00e0-vis the prior three, and that would amount to something that's averaged historically between $150 million and $200 million of increased costs in the fourth quarter, vis-\u00e0-vis the average for the nine months that would have preceded that, Nigel. Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss with Bank of America. Your line is open. Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, thank you. If I could just tag along the question of seasonality. Thinking about the asset management and seasonality that tends to benefit fees in the fourth quarter, how should we think about that in the upcoming quarter, given more volatile equity markets over the course of this year? Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit : Seth, this is Steve. While, again, I wouldn't offer any kind of quantification, we do see incentive fees, for example, being something that is \u2013 where there is a seasonal lift in the fourth quarter. Again, that pattern may very well persist. There could be some impact from market volatility, but the nature of that business is such that a fair amount of those fees are realized in the fourth quarter. Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. So some of those fees are independent of what happens with market performance or is it purely market performance-based, if we think about how that will eventually come in? Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit : Some will be impacted either directly or indirectly by market volatility, some are largely uncorrelated with equity market volatility at least. Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Eric Bass with Citigroup, your line is open. Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, thank you. For individual life, you've consistently had mortality that's been favorable to your expectations the past couple of years, which is in contrast to what we've seen for much of the industry. Can you give any color on where you've seen positive trends? And I think Pru historically was less active in the older age markets. So do you think this could be a factor? Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit : Erik, this is Steve. I think that we are seeing our positive mortality trends in \u2013 pretty much across our book of business, both in terms of legacy Prudential and legacy Hartford business and in different age bands. So, it's been a fairly comprehensive experience and it's also been contributed to both in terms of severity and incidents. So I wouldn't attribute it to any particular pockets. I would just also point out that we do continuously adjust our expectations. So, the variances that we are speaking about above our expectations are variations above a bar that we do continue to raise on a very gradual basis. So, we are pleased with the performance of the book and having said that, inherently this can be something that is variable. And we don't take that into our run rate, and we do regularly call it out for your modeling purposes. Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. Thank you for the color. And then, just quickly on Habitat. Do you have any update on that transaction and potential timing for closing? Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman : Yeah, the acquisition is pending with regulators. And we and our prospective partners continue to work through the process with regulators and look forward to closing the transaction obviously as quickly as possible, which we estimate to be either later this year or in the first quarter of next year. Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with UBS. Your line is open. Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks, good morning. A question about Japan. I guess, at some point in mid-September, there were some news about the standard mortality table in Japan changing and what that could have \u2013 that that could have a negative impact, excuse me, on some of the mortality margins that are built into the life insurance products in that country. Can you, Charlie, give us your thoughts on that? Charlie F. Lowrey - Chief Operating Officer-International & EVP: Yeah. I think we look at underwriting very carefully as we do pricing and we take all of that into account as obviously as best we can and put that into what we think of as a differentiated distribution model, and work with our clients in order to come up with the best products that we can on their behalf. So, if I can, let me take a little bit of a step back and tell you about the process and hopefully that gets a little bit to your question. We think we have very much of a differentiated distribution model, as well as \u2013 and this gets a little bit to what you are talking about as well, product selection and product mix. And we apply disciplined execution to that. So, let me go through each of these just a little bit, and hopefully help answer your question. But, we operate a proprietary distribution, or tied agency system, based on the quality of both of the life planners and the life plan consultants. This has been the base of our business since it was formed and for over a quarter of a century, we have been doing business in this way, providing the highest quality service to our customers over the lifetime, over their lifetime. And this isn't an inexpensive model to operate. We take two or three out of every 100 people we interview to become life planners and they can't have been in the life insurance business before. So, we spend a great deal of time, effort, and money training them. And hence we have the extraordinary retention, persistency, and productivity metrics that we enjoy. And if you look at POJ or Gibraltar's retention ratios of 88% or POG's \u2013 POJ's persistency level of 95% or Gib's of 93%, you really see the kind of business we write. And that represents a majority of our business, because you can't take an existing agency system and retrain people. It just doesn't work. So, this is one of the fundamental differences between us and others, many of whom either have tens of thousands of part-time agents or who rely completely on third parties for distribution. And to the extent that we do use third parties, which we do, with our bank and IA partners, we also have a differentiated strategy as well, in that we second life planners into banks to provide exceptional service and expertise into selling of death protection products into the banks. And we do the same with a select number of IAs who appreciate and want the level of service that we provide. So, our model really is based on service, which we believe provides us with a differentiated and sustainable strategy. So, that's the first point. The second point gets to your question a little more, which is the product selection and product mix, because with this kind of distribution and the quality of distribution, we are able to sell products that aren't easy to sell. Right? And this is the second point of distinction. We sell life insurance or death protection, which is the hardest product to sell and we have been doing it for our entire existence, and that is the basis of the model of this business because we don't let LPs or LCs sell savings products or A&H products when they first come in. Why? Because the demand for these \u2013 because these are demand products that are easy to sell and we want them to be able to sell death protection, which remains at the core of our business, in terms of how we underwrite, who we underwrite, and the pricing of those products. Yeah, we sell A&H and some savings products as well, but we mostly sell death protection and require our field force to do so. You've seen that in every channel, especially this quarter. And we price all products appropriately to make sure we get our required level of profitability, which is where the discipline comes in. Because we can do that, because of the level of the service that we provide to our customers and our distribution partners. And that finally gets to the execution, which, again, I think deals a little bit with your questions. We can have this great strategy but it's all about execution and we think that we continue to execute. When we first started the Life Planner model 25 years ago, we hired two out of every 100 applicants to become life planners. Today, we still hire two out of every 100 applicants. In fact, in Brazil, where we are seeing significant growth, the number is slightly less than two. However, the execution of the business doesn't just relate to people, but it relates to products as well. And we have a long history of rigorous pricing and underwriting and canceling products if we can't reach the targeted level of profitability. So, we either reduce commissions or increase pricing or, in fact, discontinue sales of certain products that are more interest-rate sensitive, if they can't meet our profit expectations. As an example, both POJ and Gibraltar reduced crediting rates on the un-denominated single-premium whole life from 1% to 75 basis points in the beginning of July, or Gibraltar discontinued its single premium endowment product at the same time. So, when you think about the mortality tables, when you think about the way in which we approach this business, we approach it from the perspective of focusing very strongly on death protection, very high quality service, and an extraordinarily good underwriting process that takes those variables into account. So, I just wanted to go through and give you a little bit of that background because hopefully that helps address the question from both a little bit of a granular perspective, but more importantly, from taking a step back and telling you really how we think about the business and the history of the business over time and, in fact, the way we're going to run the business going forward. Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. So just to paraphrase, I guess, you are saying that your model is adaptable if we get some new mortality tables, or frankly, anything that comes down the pike, that you will make the necessary adjustments to maintain your profitability target? Charlie F. Lowrey - Chief Operating Officer-International & EVP: Oh, you bet. We absolutely do that. I mean, we reprice our fixed annuities every other week. And you've seen us, I think, make the changes necessary, in terms of either lowering commissions or increasing products, either increasing pricing or in fact, just discontinuing sales if we can't make it work. So, we're going to protect our margins and you can see that in the ROEs we generate over time and the low level of volatility that this business is \u2013 has displayed for well over a decade. Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And then just the last one for, I guess, either Mark or Rob. So, I'm looking at this page 11 in your supplement and you have this roughly $8 billion of operating debt which I think you kind of reclassify as needed, based on your capital requirements changing. Is there a limitation in terms of how much of this $8 billion number could get reclassified as operating debt? Because it's tied to some assets or something like that; it's already being \u2013 it's already funding some asset? Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think you mean get reclassified from operating to capital debt? Is that what you're asking, Suneet? Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. I might have said it the other way around, but I think you get my drift. Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, so it's currently classified as operating. Yeah, the amount of that, of borrowings that we have, that is \u2013 that's backing \u2013 operating debt that's backing cash is close to $2.5 billion, so that amount could be sitting in cash and could be used for capital purposes should we need it. Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. But anything above that, that's sitting in this operating debt, is already funding something and so it could not be reclassified? Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. And most of that is for purposes of our captive financing AXXX financing in our life captives. Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Your line is open. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi, thanks. Good morning. The life planner count in Japan has been picking up a lot this year. Can you give us some underlying color on the dynamics there? Charlie F. Lowrey - Chief Operating Officer-International & EVP: Sure, I'm happy to. It's up 6%. This is a new record in Japan, and it really pertains to a couple of things. On the face of it, it's a higher number of sales managers. But let me just go through the three ins and outs, because I think this will give some clarification. First of all, the three ins and outs that can take place, the first ones are recruits versus terminations. And we had a stronger \u2013 we had strong recruits and lower terminations this quarter. So, that was a good factor. Secondly is the process of turning life planners into sales managers. And over the past two years, we have added 54 new sales managers. Now, initially when you do that, as you saw last year in the spring, that lowers the LP count. But then theoretically adds to the LP count later, because a sales manager's job is obviously to recruit, develop, and retain LPs. And the new sales managers tend to recruit more than existing sales managers, who already manage a group of LPs. So, we expected the increase in sales managers to help LP recruiting in the future. And that's exactly what happened. We said \u2013 there's always a lag effect, right? So, it usually takes about a year for the new sales managers to begin to really recruit and gear up. And when we recruited a large number of sales managers, or changed them from life planners to sales managers last year, we expected that to have an effect this year and it really has. The third in and out is taking LPs and seconding them into the bank. So what we do is we take the lower performing LPs and give them the opportunity to become secondees in the bank channel. Because we train the LPs to perform three tasks \u2013 to prospect, to present, and to close. And if an LP fails, it's usually because he or she can't prospect. But in the banks, the beautiful part of it is they don't need to prospect. So, as secondees they can perform very well and advocate selling recurring premium death protection products, which is exactly what they are doing and you see the increased sales in banks because of it. So having said all of this, let me sort of talk about growth rates. Because the growth rate for LPs in Japan over the long term is unlikely to materially accelerate, given the large number of LPs we have in Japan. So, if you consolidate all the ins and outs, the long term average growth of POJ for LPs is about 2% or 3%. Last year, we had a couple of quarters of either zero or maybe a little negative. This quarter was 6%. So, you will see some fluctuation over time, but if you looked at a long-term average, it's probably 2% or 3%. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks. And then just last year on the outlook call you talked about investing in technology systems and infrastructure. Can you just give an update in terms of how far along you are on that and if you'd expect similar costs related to those initiatives next year? Charlie F. Lowrey - Chief Operating Officer-International & EVP: So, is that \u2013 are you referring to international or are you referring to... Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Oh, no, that was an overall company question. Charlie F. Lowrey - Chief Operating Officer-International & EVP: Okay. Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, so, Ryan, it's Rob. Perhaps I'll take that. I would say the spending is consistent with what we've \u2013 the guidance that we provided last year. The net spending may be, from a pace \u2013 surely from a pace standpoint, a little under the guidance that we otherwise provided, but we think the numbers that we provided last year are still sort of relevant and there may be slippage between any given year, but that level of investment has not expanded. It has gotten drawn out a little bit, but by and large is in place or intact, and we would expect to continue to make that order of magnitude of investments into the businesses. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Alan Mark Finkelstein - Senior Vice President & Head- Investor Relations : Cynthia, I think we will take one more question, please. Operator : And that will be from the line of Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. The question I had is on \u2013 if I look at the yen hedge guidance you just gave us for 2016, 106, that's about a 15%, 16% depreciation versus prior year, so a fairly sizable headwind. And if I recall correctly, the discussion about the yen capital hedge, which currently, I think you said is a $2 billion gain, was put in place to preserve some of that earnings power that you may otherwise lose. So can we assume that you're going to look to monetize and utilize some of that $2 billion to offset some of this headwind or is that just a much longer term structure that we should be thinking about and not something that's going to offset the 2016 impact? Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So Tom, it's Rob. Let me take two pieces of that. First, with regard to earnings impact, remember, when you take those percentages that you have to apply that just to the yen component of our earnings. And so just by way of example, if it's kind of helpful to (64:11) that if we applied the 106 to this year \u2013 this quarter's results, it would have resulted in about a 2% dilution or about $0.06 a share. So just to kind of give you a benchmark for the impact of that change in the plan rate. The second question with regard to the yen equity hedge, what you stated is absolutely correct. That hedge is both designed and calibrated so that over time the gains from the hedge can be used to offset any dilution in earnings that are resulting from depreciation in the yen. And with respect to sort of how and when that may be done, I would simply observe that we understand the mechanic that we put in place and to how the mechanic needs to work in order to be effectuated. Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got you. Okay. So \u2013 and just a follow-up on that, is that \u2013 so in what way should we be thinking about the monetization of that and a potential offset to the earnings drag? Could it span the gamut of extra buybacks, M&A, like how should we be thinking about that? Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So the way that it's calibrated is such that it generates cash, capital that can be redeployed either in buybacks or in acquisitions, acquisitions would be at our target return of 13% to 14%, yielding those kind of returns, such that if we did either the buybacks or we did the acquisitions with that capital, we would restore the earnings that were lost as a result of the depreciation in the yen over sort of a period-to-period basis Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And then my last question is, Rob, just going back to the comments you made about the NAIC proposal on VA captives, is it \u2013 could it be something as positive for you as releasing that, I think it was a $4 billion reserve redundancy that you guys had been maintaining in the captive. I mean, is there a \u2013 and maybe that's the Super Bowl case in terms of what the outcome here might be for you. But is there any way to \u2013 and I realize there's probably more work to be done here, but I believe what you said previously is you guys hold $8 billion of reserves and on an economic basis you probably only need half of that. But so anyway, any help you can give on that would be appreciated. Robert F. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Tom, so a couple of things. First, let me clarify. What we stated is that the amount of reserves we're holding are a little less than two times that which would be required at the seeding company. We didn't put that in terms of the economic capital in reserves that we would be holding, but rather that which is required from a statutory standpoint. I would say, as I mentioned, when I responded to the earlier question, we're very encouraged by the dialogue and think that it could have a good outcome. But having said that, I also mentioned it's a long process, and therefore I think it's inappropriate to speculate on the outcome of the discussion at this point or how it may influence our plans. I would say that based on the level of capital in reserves that we hold, we believe that we have adequate capacity to accommodate a range of outcomes that could be coming out of the NAIC process. But regardless of what comes out of that process, we're going to continue a very disciplined approach around the managing our VA risks and holding a prudent level of capital and reserves against those risks. Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you.

Representing Prudential on today\u2019s call are John Strangfeld, CEO; Mark Grier, Vice Chairman; Charlie Lowrey, Head of International Businesses; Steve Pelletier, Head of Domestic Businesses; Rob Falzon, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by John, Mark and Rob; and then, we will answer your questions. Today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of such measures to the comparable GAAP measures and a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, please see the section titled Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measure of our earnings press release, which can be found on our website at www.investor.prudential.com. John, I\u2019ll hand it over to you. John Strangfeld : Thank you, Mark. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 2015 was a good year for Prudential. Our ROE exceeded 14%. And in a challenging year, we met our financial objectives. Business fundamentals remain strong with both our strategic positioning and execution supporting superior performance. Fourth quarter earnings of $2.07 per share based on adjusted operating income excluding market-driven and discrete items was adversely affected by higher expenses, which we had previewed on the third quarter call, and lower non-coupon investment income returns. As many of you know who follow Prudential are aware, our recent results have tended to be stronger in the first-half of the year and weaker in the fourth quarter. For the full-year, earnings per share on the same basis of $9.86, was at the midpoint of the guidance we set out in our financial outlook call in December of 2014, achieved despite less favorable market conditions than were assumed in the guidance. This translates to an ROE for 2015 of 14.2%, which was modestly exceeded the high-end of our long-term ROE objective of 13% to 14%. Book value per share, excluding AOCI and foreign currency remeasurement grew nearly 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. This strength reflects more consistently between our operating income and net income, one of our key priorities. Mark and Rob will walk through the specifics of our results as well as our capital position in more detail. I will touch on a few highlights. To start, our international businesses had a solid year. In the fundamentals and earnings power, these businesses are strong. On a constant currency basis, year-over-year earnings excluding market-driven and discrete items grew modestly, and constant dollar sales grew 8% at both our Life Planner and Gibraltar businesses. Additionally, we are seeing positive trends in our distribution network. While the interest rate actions taken by the Bank of Japan are clearly a headwind, and we will react appropriately, as we\u2019ve done in Japan over many years, our Japanese businesses have historically generated ROEs in the 20% range. And we expect them to continue to generate superior returns. Earnings for our U.S. businesses excluding market-driven and discrete items were down from 2014, though this was due to more than $300 million swing in non-coupon investment income from the favorable results of the prior year. But underneath the headline numbers, we are seeing solid fundamental growth drivers in several businesses. Asset Management generated unaffiliated third party net flows of $22 billion for the year, representing its 13th consecutive year of positive institutional flows. And individual life insurance sales grew 31% across products, while meeting our targeted product mix. Our Retirement business continues to show leadership in the pension risk transfer market, with participation in all of the larger funded transactions completed in 2015. And Full-Service Retirement had solid net flows for the year with a meaningful large case win in the third quarter. And although the annuity business reported lower sales in 2015, we remain disciplined in our pricing and are achieving our diversification priorities. We have also seen good underwriting margins across our domestic businesses, most notably our Retirement business had $80 million of positive case experience in pension risk transfer for the year. And our Group Insurance business produced solid underwriting results, particularly in disability, which is benefited from its multiyear repricing efforts. As we turn to 2016, the outlook is clearly more challenging as we highlighted on our financial outlook call. Market headwinds have only intensified in early 2016. While these pressures are meaningful, we benefit from our unique mix of businesses that produce top-tier returns and diverse source of earnings and cash flow as well as our very strong capital position. Our business mix combined with the strong execution and an opportunistic approach to markets has enabled us to grow adjusted operating earnings per share at a pace well above industry averages, about 12% annually over the last five years. This has contributed to our ability to deploy increasing amounts of capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, amounting to about $9 billion since the beginning of 2011 or roughly a quarter of our current book value. Recall that we raised our dividend 21% in December and the board increased our share repurchase authorization to $1.5 billion for 2016, which reflects an increasing level of capital generation in our businesses. Additionally, one of our key strategic priorities as a company is to reduce the complexity and volatility in our business and increase transparency, issues that have distracted from our strong fundamental picture. At our financial outlook call, we announced the planned recapture of our living benefit riders from our variable annuity captive, in order to house all of the product risk together in our statutory entities. We expect this important step to further simplify our operations and reduce a significant source of volatility. We will provide more details through 2016 as the transaction is finalized, but I\u2019d like to provide an update on our recapture and also provide perspective on our annuities business in the context of a broader retirement strategy. We managed the annuity business conservatively and we hold strong reserves and capital to support the economic product risks, a practice that we will continue subsequent to the recapture. And we priced this into the product. Even with the decline in interest rates in equity markets in early 2016, we expect the planned recapture to increase and not detract from our capital flexibility. And we expect it to reduce the overall volatility in our capital capacity. We generate good risk adjusted returns on variable annuities, particularly as competitors have exited the market and the risk profile of the product has improved. We are targeting and achieving mid-teen returns. And expect the business to generate deployable capital consistent with the 60% of our earnings we target for Prudential overall. So as we sit today, we view variable annuities of the core product with solid return and cash flow prospects. And it\u2019s well managed in the context of a global platform of businesses that produce a diverse set of risks and sources of cash flow. We also view the annuity business as part of a broader retirement theme, which is a compelling long-term growth opportunity, and one where we have invested heavily to build differentiated capabilities. We serve retail and institutional clients in multiple capacities, including through our defined contribution, stable value, pension risk transfer and annuity platforms. And we bring exceptional execution skills and asset management capabilities. We believe the growth and margin opportunity through this longer-term theme puts us in a position to deliver significant value to our shareholders. Now, let me touch briefly on the regulatory environment, before handing it over to Mark. We continue to participate with the Federal Reserve and the IAIS, as they develop capital standards applicable to insurance entities. While we do not know what these standards will ultimately be, we continue to manage our business to very strong capital levels. And this gives us confidence that we are well-positioned to meet any reasonable standards without competitive disadvantages to our products. It\u2019s also unclear what the Department of Labor will issue as the final fiduciary standards. And we have participated actively with the industry groups in sharing our views of the unintended consequences of the draft regulations. But we also believe that our business mix and global platform puts us in a less exposed position than many of our peers. Thus, as we think about 2016 and beyond, the combination of our differentiated business mix and strong capital position provides us confidence in our ability to produce solid results even as market conditions remain volatile. And also to take advantage of opportunities that will likely emerge. With that, I\u2019d like to hand it over to Mark. Mark Grier : Excuse me. Thank you, John. Good morning, good afternoon or good evening. Thank you for joining our year-end earnings call. I\u2019ll take you through our results and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Rob Falzon who will cover our capital and liquidity picture. And I\u2019ll start on Slide 2. After-tax adjusted operating income amounted to a $1.94 per share for the quarter, compared to $2.12 a year ago. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, EPS was down $0.26 from a year ago. While underlying performance across our businesses was solid, the decrease reflected a lower contribution from non-coupon investments and higher expenses in the current quarter. Non-coupon investment returns and prepayment income were about $40 million below our average expectations in the quarter, in contrast to a year ago, when the contribution was about $90 million above expectations. And the higher expense level included nonlinear items such as business development costs, benefit plan true-ups and technology expenses. We estimate that these two items together with less favorable currency exchange rates had a negative impact of roughly $0.40 per share on the comparison of results to a year ago. In thinking about our quarterly earnings pattern, I would also note that we estimate current quarter expenses for items such as technology and business development, annual policyholder communications and onboarding, and advertising and other variable costs were about $175 million above our quarterly average for the year; consistent with the historical pattern we mentioned when we discussed our third quarter results. Considering the higher expenses in the quarter relative to the full-year average and other variances from average expectations, including non-coupon returns, the impact on earnings this quarter would be roughly $0.25 to $0.30 per share. On a GAAP basis, including amounts categorized as realized investment gains or losses and results from divested businesses, we reported net income of $735 million for the current quarter. This compares to $1.2 billion net loss a year ago, which included a substantial negative impact from foreign currency exchange rate remeasurement, which we have taken steps to mitigate. Slide 3, shows financial highlights for the year. Earnings per share for the year amounted to $9.86, after adjusting for market driven and discrete items, which implies an ROE of 14.2%. The full-year EPS comparison reflects lower non-coupon investment returns and less favorable currency exchange rates. Together, these items had a negative impact of roughly $0.75 per share on the comparison of results. Turning to Slide 4, for the current quarter, market-driven and discrete items resulted in a net charge of $0.13 per share. These items included estimated remediation costs in Corporate and Other related to administration of separate accounts, also included a reserve true-up in Individual Life related to conversion of a valuation system and also included our quarterly market and experience unlocking in the annuities business. Moving to Slide 5, our GAAP net income of $735 million in the current quarter includes amounts characterized as net realized investment losses of $196 million, and divested business results and other items outside of adjusted operating income amounting to pre-tax losses of $141 million. Of note, the gain from general portfolio activities came mainly from rebalancing activities in our Japanese general account. We haven\u2019t seen signs of significant credit deterioration in our investment portfolio. The majority of the current quarter impairments relate to equity holdings and were taken based on the length of time with unrealized losses. Energy sector related realized losses were roughly $30 million in the quarter. Product related embedded derivatives and hedging had a negative impact of $534 million, largely due to the impact of applying credit spreads to our gross GAAP liability balance for variable annuity living benefits, which decreased due to rising equities and interest rates in the quarter. Moving to our business results, starting on Slide 6 with annuities, I\u2019ll discuss the comparative results excluding the market-driven and discrete items that I\u2019ve already mentioned. Annuities earnings were $403 million for the quarter, up $13 million from a year ago. Return on Assets or ROA was 104 basis points for the fourth quarter, roughly in line with the earlier quarters of the year and up from a year ago. The earnings increase in ROA improvement came mainly from lower interest expense. A 3% decline in policy charges and fees driven by the decline in average account values was essentially offset by lower base amortization and distribution costs. Slide 7, presents our annuity sales. You can see the impact of our product diversification strategy in the change in our sales mix. Notably, we have reinsured the living benefit guarantee related to our Highest Daily or HD product, representing about 18% of gross sales for 2015. Recall that this contract started in April and extends through 2016. We\u2019ve also grown sales of our fixed income based PDI product and investment-focused annuities. As a result, only about 40% of our sales for the year and about one-third for the current quarter come with retained exposure to equity market linked living benefit guarantees. Turning to Slide 8, retirement earnings were $168 million for the quarter compared to $294 million a year ago. The decrease was mainly driven by a $105 million lower contribution from net investment results. Returns from non-coupon investments and mortgage prepayment income were about $20 million below our average expectations in the current quarter versus about $70 million above average expectations a year ago. Bond portfolio yields were also lower in the current quarter. The remainder of the earnings decline came mainly from higher expenses including business development costs. The sequential quarter decline in earnings was mainly driven by a lower contribution from investment results and higher expenses. The latter of which were about $15 million greater in the fourth quarter than our quarterly average for the year. Turning to Slide 9, total retirement gross deposits and sales were $8.3 billion for the current quarter compared to $14.2 billion a year ago. Standalone institutional gross sales were $3.4 billion for the quarter, including $1.8 billion from three significant funded in PRT cases, compared to sales of $8.5 billion a year ago, which included about $7 billion of significant funded and unfunded PRT cases. Full-service sales were roughly in line with a year ago. Total retirement account values amounted to $369 billion at year-end, up by about $5 billion from a year earlier. Net flows were about $4 billion for the year, driven largely by our full-service business. In our institutional standalone business, we more than offset our run off of funded PRT business with just under $4 billion of significant new cases that closed during the year. Turning to Slide 10, Asset Management earnings were $198 million for the quarter compared to $192 million a year ago. While most of the segments results come from asset management fees, the increase from a year ago was driven by a greater contribution from incentive, transaction, strategic investing and commercial mortgage activities, reflecting a gain of about $10 million from an asset disposition in the current quarter. Asset management fees are up 3% year-over-year tracking the increase in overall assets under management. Unaffiliated third party AUM grew about $25 billion from a year ago with $22 billion of net flows over the past year, including about $5 billion in the current quarter, mainly driven by new institutional fixed income mandates. The earnings benefit from continued growth of asset management fees was more than offset by a lower contribution from the segments other operations, which included an earn-out gain of about $10 million a year ago and also included higher expenses, including to support growth initiatives. Turning to Slide 11, Individual Life earnings were $119 million for the quarter compared to $135 million a year ago. The net contribution from claims experience was modestly below our average expectations for the current quarter and about $15 million less favorable than a year ago. For the full year, our mortality experience was roughly in line with our average expectations. The current quarter contribution from investment results was also down from a year ago and included returns on non-coupon investments slightly below our average expectations. Considered together, these items had a negative impact of about $10 million on current quarter results. I would highlight that expenses in the quarter were about $20 million greater than our quarterly average for the year. Turning to Slide 12, Individual Life sales based on annualized new business premiums were up $49 million or 38% from a year ago. Guaranteed Universal life sales contributed $30 million of the increase, mainly from greater sales in selected age bands where we re-priced to bring our rates more in line with the market. The remainder of the increase came mainly from our other Universal Life products. Turning to Slide 13, Group Insurance earnings were $27 million for the quarter compared to $44 million a year ago. The decrease in earnings was driven by a lower contribution from investment results with non-coupon returns slightly below our average expectations, and modestly less favorable underwriting results reflecting the impact of a smaller disability block driven by our re-pricing actions. Slide 14 presents a timeline of our Group Insurance benefits ratios after adjustment for the impact of our actuarial reviews and other refinements. Our benefits ratio for 2015 is near the low-end of our targeted range of 87% to 91%, reflecting the substantial completion of underwriting and re-pricing actions we\u2019ve taken over the last few years. As we\u2019ve commented, benefits ratios can fluctuate from one quarter to another. But we feel that we are now positioned for controlled growth with ongoing pricing and underwriting discipline. Moving to International Insurance and turning to Slide 15. Earnings for our Life Planner business were $367 million for the quarter, compared to $382 million a year ago. Excluding a $14 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, earnings are essentially unchanged from a year ago. The benefit to earnings from continued business growth was offset by higher expenses and less favorable mortality experience in the current quarter. The higher levels of expenses in the current quarter reflected benefit plan costs, including an unfavorable true-up and costs to update technology as part of an ongoing project. Mortality experience in the current quarter was about $10 million more favorable than average expectations, but about $15 million less favorable than a year ago. The sequential quarter decline in earnings mainly reflects the concentration of expenses in the fourth quarter, which are about $40 million above the quarterly average for the year, including items such as benefit plan and technology costs. Turning to Slide 16, Gibraltar Life earnings were $371 million for the quarter compared to $385 million a year ago. Excluding a negative impact of $13 million on the comparison from foreign currency exchange rates, earnings are essentially unchanged from a year-ago. The contribution to quarterly results from policy benefits experience included mortality about $15 million more favorable than our average expectations. But mortality was about $10 million below the year ago quarter, which benefited from higher surrender gains. The benefit of business growth was offset by a lower net contribution from investment results, including non-coupon returns about $10 million below our average expectations in the current quarter. Expenses in the fourth quarter were about $15 million above the quarterly average for the year. Turning to Slide 17, International Insurance sales on a constant dollar basis was $692 million for the current quarter, up $43 million or 7% from a year ago. The increase was driven by our Life Planners in Japan and other key markets and by Gibraltar\u2019s bank channel and life consultants. Life Planner sales in Japan were up 7% from a year ago, reflecting a 6% increase in agent-count and mainly driven by greater term insurance sales. Life Planner sales outside of Japan were up 10%, mainly from an increase in Brazil where Life Planner count has grown about 20% from a year ago. Gibraltar sales were up by 5% from a year ago. Sales from the bank channel increased 12%, largely driven by a recurring premium U.S. dollar retirement income product that is popular among high net worth clients of a key distributor that we recently cultivated. Turning to Slide 18, the corporate and other loss was $378 million for the current quarter, compared to $326 million loss a year ago. Corporate expenses can fluctuate. The increased loss came mainly from higher expenses, including items that are inherently variable such as strategic initiatives and hedging costs that we retain in corporate and other. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Rob. Robert Falzon : Thanks, Mark. I will provide an update on some key items under the heading of financial strength and flexibility. Starting on Slide 19. While statutory results are not yet final, we estimate that PICO will report RBC well above our 400% target as of year-end. In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margins of 853% and 900% respectively, as of their most recent reporting date September 30, 2015. Looking at our overall capital and liquidity position on Slide 20, a year-ago we estimated our available on-balance-sheet capital capacity at approximately $2 billion on a net basis. This represented about $4 billion a gross basis, less $2 billion earmarked to reduce capital debt, to arrive at our long-term targeted financial ratio of 25%. During the year, we returned over $2 billion of capital to shareholders, including $1 billion of share repurchases and over $1 billion of common stock dividends, including a fourth quarter dividend representing a 21% increase. At the same time, we\u2019ve increased our on-balance-sheet capital capacity to over $4 billion at year-end, and have brought our leverage ratios within our targets of 25% for financial leverage and 45% for total leverage. The increase in capital capacity in the standalone fourth quarter was mainly driven by capital generated from our businesses and a favorable impact from estimated statutory AAT reserves; net of about $600 million of dividends and share repurchases in the quarter. The fair value of the Japan equity hedge, which is not included in our capital capacity was about $1.7 billion at year-end. As John mentioned, we remain on schedule to recapture our VA living benefit rider and managed the risks in our statutory entities. We continue to believe this action will not have a negative impact on our available on-balance-sheet capital capacity, and expect it to contribute to our overall financial flexibility. As we noted, we will continue to manage the risks to AA standards and CTE 97 levels. We will provide more details as the recapture occurs during 2016. To address the current topic, our direct and indirect exposure to the energy sector at year-end was about 4% of our general account portfolio excluding the Closed Block. Our energy exposure is mainly through public and private corporate fixed maturities, of which roughly 90% are investment grade, and net of unrealized losses of about $200 million. Turning to the cash position of the parent company, cash and short-term investments net of outstanding commercial paper amounted to about $5 billion as of year-end. The cash in excess of our targeted $1.3 billion of liquidity cushion is available to repay maturing operating debt, to fund operating needs and to deploy over time for strategic and capital management purposes. Now, I\u2019ll turn it back over to John. John Strangfeld : Thank you, Rob. Thank you, Mark. We\u2019d like to open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger, KBW. Please go ahead. Ryan Krueger : Hey, thanks. Good morning. I was first hoping you could give us some perspective on how to think about your sensitivity to - excess capital sensitivity to lower interest rates that are currently in the kind of the 160 range. Anything you could provide there would be helpful. Robert Falzon : Ryan, it\u2019s Rob. Happy to do so. First let me caveat that, obviously, we can\u2019t update guidance or initially update our year-end numbers. And actually, if you don\u2019t mind, what I\u2019m going to do is, I\u2019m going to take the liberty of anticipating your follow-up question which is thinking about the same question in the context of what the impacts may be to our earnings. And so let me hit both of those in the same - at the same time if that\u2019s okay. And actually I\u2019ll just start with the earnings, because I think that\u2019s relatively straightforward. If you look at the performance in the fourth quarter, what we would note is that there have been no changes in the underlying business fundamentals from the point which we provided guidance. We knew and communicated about the level and timing of expenses. And we stated that we expected 2016 to be about $0.15 over these levels. With regard to the sensitivity to the capital markets, specifically to the question you asked, I think we\u2019ve given those - the guidance on that out before, about a 100 basis points plus or minus and interest rates is $0.20 a share, and equity markets plus or minus 10% is about $0.30 a share, excluding our alternatives portfolio. On the capital piece, we actually don\u2019t provide similar rules of thumb for capital. And it\u2019s primarily because it\u2019s not linear and it\u2019s also subject to management actions. We actively obviously manage that capital position. But I have a couple of observations. First, if you look historically, the two largest drivers to our capital volatility in response to markets has been in our annuities business and as a result of AAT updates. So let me turn to AAT first. If you pro-formaed the decline in interest rates since year-end back on our calculation at the end of last year, it would not have a material impact on the year-end calculation. And the reason for that is there are three components for the AAT calculation in addition to assumptions, three market components. It\u2019s underlying treasuries, but it also reflects credit spreads. So while treasuries have come down, credit spreads have expanded pretty dramatically. And it\u2019s also the calculation is floored off the - it\u2019s keyed off the five-year treasury and that has an impact as well. So turning from AAT to the annuities business, as you know, we are in the process of recapturing the risks that we ceded out to our captive. There are number of motivations for undertaking to do this. One of which is to reduce the volatility in capital and leverage that has been associated with market movements historically in that business, and as a result of that captive. It\u2019s inappropriate for me to comment further. Given that we\u2019re still on process. But I\u2019d caution you to remember or encourage you to remember that it\u2019s our expectation that we will be substantially less sensitive to rate movements going forward in the annuities business subsequent to the completion of that recapture. And actually, let me add one last thought. And that is that while the market movements are certainly not welcome, they are not by any means unexpected or unanticipated. And what I mean by that is the degree of movement that we\u2019ve seen so far this quarter is anticipated in our own cyclical stresses, that we consider before we make decisions about how we\u2019re going to be deploying capital during the course of the year. We run those stress scenarios in order to ensure that we can execute on our plans in the face of what we think of as moderate or cyclical levels of market volatility, and what we\u2019ve seen to date would fit within that definition. Ryan Krueger : That\u2019s very helpful, Rob. Thank you. And then a separate question, can you give us some sense of how much non-coupon investment income you would expect in either a normal quarter or a normal year? Robert Falzon : I think I can answer that question. Yes, so if you look at the expected level of our earnings across the - if I look at first the U.S. portfolio, for the fourth quarter our expected level of earnings was about - total was 9.3 - hang on one second. John Strangfeld : Do you want to go on another question and come back to that while you check it? Robert Falzon : Yes. Yes. I am actually not finding that right up, but let me come back to that, Ryan, if it\u2019s okay. Ryan Krueger : Okay. That will be great. Thanks. Robert Falzon : Actually, I think I - actually, I think I have the numbers here. The total returns in the fourth quarter across both the U.S. and international businesses were about $48 million. The expected variance on that against what we would otherwise have anticipated was about negative 30. So if you add those two numbers together, that would get you to a total expected level. Does that make sense to you? Ryan Krueger : Yes, yes. Yes, that\u2019s perfect. Thanks. Robert Falzon : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Erik Bass with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Erik Bass : Hi, thank you. Just first, can you just discuss the impact, if any, of the recent moves by the Bank of Japan on your Japan business? Mark Grier : Sure. I will take that probably in two parts, because there is a part that has to do with product and there\u2019s a part that has to do with investment. So let me start with the products first, in terms of sort of rates and re-pricing. But if I can, let me step back and put the Japan business into perspective. So if you look at the entire year within our Japan business, yen-based products are slightly more than half of sales and foreign currency is slightly under half. In terms of the entire international operation the yen-based products are about 45% of sales. Now, it\u2019s also important to note out or to point out that about 82% of what we do - what we sell is recurring pay products. And of the 18% that is single pay, 13% is fixed annuities, which we price every two weeks. So if you put all those numbers to the Cuisinart and you boil them down, you see that less than 5% of our international sales are single premium life or retirement products in Japan, and we monitor those really carefully. And to put that into perspective, what that 5% means, we sold less than $20 million of single premium life or retirement products in the fourth quarter. So the next point I\u2019d like to make is we\u2019ve been dealing with decreasing interest rate environment for a long time and maintaining profitability. For example, we sell no single premium A&H products. We only sell recurring premium products, so there is minimal spread risk associated with these. In addition, we stopped selling any single premium endowment products last year. Having said that, of course, there will be some impact to low rates, but it\u2019s a matter of degree. And the way we manage the risk is we continuously examine our product lineup and its profitability, adjusting pricing when necessary to reflect lower rate levels, which again we\u2019ve been doing for years as rates have been coming down. We also reduced commissions or discontinued sales of certain products that are more interest-rate sensitive, if they can\u2019t meet our profit expectations. For example, Gibraltar Life stopped paying its - stopped selling its six year single premium endowment product in March of 2015. And in July, we discontinued selling the single premium whole life through the bank channel. Gibraltar also discontinued selling its 10-year single premium endowment product, which again means that all sales of single premium endowment products in the Japan business have been discontinued. And we\u2019ve also reduced crediting rates on certain products for BOJ and Gibraltar. So we\u2019ve taken and will continue to take action on all our product lines to maintain the appropriate level of profitability in the face of the current interest rate environments or changes to interest - valuation tables or mortality tables or other things. The other thing to remember is that within Japan over 60% of our premiums enforce a new sales or from products where most of the profits come from mortality, morbidity or expense margins. So inherently, we\u2019re less dependent upon spread even when you think about recurring premium product or low interest rates for a long period of time. So in summary, there are three main reasons for our ability to maintain the profitability. One are the factors that - other factors other than just price which are important, i.e., our strategy to emphasize service to our customers, which gets the strength of our capital distribution which is critical. And the way they approach both their customers and the way that we approach third party distribution. The second is the type of products we sell, most of which are recurring premium and much of which is less dependent upon spread, given the extraordinary emphasis we have on protection products. And the third is the discipline we have around profitability, i.e., re-pricing products, reducing commissions or eliminating unprofitable product. So that\u2019s the product side. The other part of your question really has to do with, I think, reinvestment which is how do we - how are we reinvesting the premiums and the rollover in this environment. So first, let me talk about rollovers and size-band. In the existing portfolio our Japan portfolio is about $121 billion, of which about 45% of the portfolio is in JGBs. The portfolios have long duration. The LP portfolio is about 16 years and Gibraltar is about 10. So rollover is relatively light. And to put a number on that, rollover this year is less than $1 billion of the yen denominated investments at the portfolio level. The second issue is how should we invest new premiums and rollovers given the recent lower rates. But first, recognize that a significant portion of the investment portfolio supporting the yen product is invested in long-term bonds that have been acquired over time and it yields higher than the current Japanese government bond yields. So we\u2019re starting out in a good place. But we have adjusted our investment strategies to changing market conditions. And post the BOJ announcement on January 29 we did significantly reduce our purchase of JGB. However, strategically our long-term investment philosophy emphasizing discipline, asset and liability management hasn\u2019t changed. And so for new investments given the long duration nature of our liabilities, we are purchasing JGBs further out on the curve in the 20- to 40-year range to the extent we\u2019re investing in the shorter end of the curve, i.e., 10 years or less. That\u2019s where we focus on non-yen investment hedged back to yen. So our investment strategy for yen products will be to continue to invest in longer term JGBs and combining those purchases with a considerable allocation to more attractive yielding U.S. dollar assets hedged back the yen, including U.S. dollar private placements, commercial mortgage loans and corporate bonds. This enables us to earn yields that are higher than those available from just having JGBs. Thereby, somewhat mitigating the impact of low interest rates at the short-end of the curve. So hopefully that addresses both the product and the investment side. Erik Bass : Yes. Thank you very much. And then, I just had one bigger picture strategic question, I guess is in light of the recent announcements from Met and AIG. And I realize that your situation is different in some ways given the higher return profile of your current business mix. I guess, just curious, are you currently exploring a sort of plan B options in case final SIFI rules end up being more onerous than you expect, and the SIFI off-ramp is shown to exist. John Strangfeld : Erik, one actually [ph], this is John. Let me tell you how we are thinking about that and other related questions, and do it more macro, do it more expansively, start with retirement annuities and then work it back into business mix evaluation. Because we know and anticipated there is likely to be questions about that. So let me give you a long form answer that hits that range I just talked about. Firstly, retirement in general and the income phase in particular is one of the largest macro trends in financial services for the next 20 years. And these macro forces not only bode well for financial services industry in general, but they particularly are for insurance companies in particular. We\u2019re not interested in disinvesting in retirement. And one of the reasons - the reasons for this are both strategic and financial. Strategically, we\u2019ve intentionally positioned ourselves to be in the thick of the retirement macro, PRT, annuities, DC, DB, stable valued Asset Management. And we\u2019ve executed on the strategy I think exceptionally well. It\u2019s reflected in our investment performance, our success in the marketplace and our fundamentals in terms of sales and flows. And the motivation is not simply strategic, it\u2019s also financial as well as, as you are acknowledging, our retirement businesses make a major contribution to our growth rate, which has averaged over 12% per year in the last five years. Our ROE, which has exceeded our 13% to 14% target for some time, both of which are considerably better than peers as you are commenting. Turning more specifically to annuities just for a moment, helping clients accumulate retirement savings is something many financial players can do. Creating income streams for life is primarily the domain of insurance companies. So it\u2019s very easy to foresee a landscape shift and the relative importance of players are purely asset gatherers, asset managers, to those who can also contribute to the lifetime income dimension. And that\u2019s where annuities can play a particularly important role, particularly in broader and simpler applications than we think are likely to evolve in the future. Now, beyond on the strategic relevance, the financial aspect of our annuity business is a very positive as well as, as we talked about strong returns and a well-capitalized business, strong cash flows. And those are not aspirational. That\u2019s a reality and 2015 is a good example. The challenge for us in this area has been historically the earnings and capital volatility. And in the last two years we\u2019ve taken very significant measures to moderate that volatility, whether it\u2019s the reinsurance with Hamilton or the recapture of our annuities captive. And we expect these measures, as Rob was referencing, to substantially reduce the volatility going forward and to enhance our capital flexibility. So when you combine the reduction in the volatility with already attractive returns and cash flow, it makes the businesses, the business all the more attractive. Now, once it go more to the - broadly to the business mix, one-time Prudential\u2019s business mix had the attributes of a financial supermarket with healthcare, P&C, brokerage, investment banking and a whole lot of other things. And you could really challenge the wisdom of that and we certainly did. And so we went through the challenging and difficulties of dramatically changing this and changing the cost structure that supported it. And what we have today is very conscious, very deliberate. It\u2019s by design, it\u2019s not by default. And we are just focused on three things : retirement, protection and asset management, taken together and even more powerfully in combination. And that\u2019s what enabled us to produce that earnings track record, the ROEs we talked about and the $9 billion of capital that we\u2019ve returned to our shareholders. For us, our challenge isn\u2019t delivering the results or the return on capital. It\u2019s getting it better reflected with what we believe should be a premium valuation. And the factors we think about, when we think about valuation and what\u2019s influencing it, it really go into three buckets : the macro-environment including low rates and foreign currency fluctuations; the regulatory uncertainty; then the complexity and transparency challenges in our business. And I\u2019ll just touch briefly on each and I\u2019ll wrap. So insofar as the macro environment, we provided the sensitivity disclosures on each key area and we\u2019ll continue to provide more. But overall, our business mix and how we manage our operations mitigates earnings impacts of any one macro driver. And further, our balance sheet strength is able to absorb substantial strain from low rates, equity markets and credit shocks, and still maintain very competitive solvency ratios. On the regulatory requirements, we don\u2019t have an answer on future capital rules yet, but we are hopeful the picture will be clear over the next couple of years. We maintain a strong balance sheet. As we say, we have substantial capital resources, which we believe will be evident and adequate under any reasonable capital standards. And in the meantime, we\u2019ve returned capital to shareholders in a very substantial and very disciplined way. And finally, a point of great emphasis that was been underway for nearly two years, it\u2019s been our focus on reducing the complexity and volatility in our business, which we believe has distracted from the underlying fundamentals and return attributes in our business. And these are very significant actions, including enhancing the visibility into our results through the raise, dividend and buyback authorization, which reflect the increased expectation of cash flow from over a year ago to 60% from 50%; the implementation of the divisional structure in Japan to mitigate the net income volatility from foreign currency remeasurement; the restructuring of the Closed Block business, which simplifies our operating structure; and preparing the recapture the VA risks, which will eliminate a substantial driver of volatility and simplify of our operations. And we\u2019ve also taken other steps like reinsuring a portion of living benefit rider on our newest Highest Daily VA business. And we will take more of those over time. Now, those actions sound technical to many, but they\u2019re very meaningful. And over time - some are kicking in right away, and others will kick in overtime - but overtime it will certainly reduce the noise in our results that distracted our broader story and create a much clear line of sight between operating results, net income, book value growth and the like. And we believe we will have a very positive effect on our view. So we are going at it with a real effort of looking at better alignment between our operating results, our financial results and our evaluation. And these are the steps we think are most appropriate for us. Erik Bass : Great. Thanks, John. I appreciate the comments. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Dally. Please go ahead. Nigel Dally : Great. Thanks and good morning. A couple of quick questions, first on capital, you mentioned that lower AAT was one of the factors helping capital this quarter. Just hoping you can mention how much that provided a boost in the fourth quarter. And then on non-coupon, just a follow-on from Ryan\u2019s question, can you also discuss the total amount invested in non-coupon investments and the competition with those investments? Robert Falzon : Nigel, it\u2019s Rob. So let me hit the first question. I can\u2019t actually give you the AAT number, because we have not yet filed our statutory numbers, our statutory blank, so the front-running are filing with the regulators. I would note it was a significant contributor to our increased capacity. There are a lot of inputs there. They\u2019re not limited to just interest rates. It also includes assumption updates. But if you look at where we are versus the end of last year, treasury rates are little higher and credit spreads have expanded as well. And those of both been positives for AAT release in addition to whatever assumptions that we\u2019ve taken there, so it was a positive and significant contributor. On the second piece, on the portfolio, so if you look at our - what we label as our non-coupon or alternatives portfolio, it\u2019s about - it\u2019s a little under $8.5 billion portfolio. The biggest pieces of that would be in private equity. It\u2019s about a quarter of it, hedge funds figure that\u2019s 15% or so of what\u2019s in there, and then, real estate, which is about $1.5 billion of that number. The residual would actually be in public equities, and so we have a fairly significant contribution in what we call as our non-coupon or our alternatives coming from public equities, largely held in our international business. A big piece of that would be in REITs. Nigel Dally : That\u2019s great. Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question comes from the line of John Nadel, Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. John Nadel : Hi, good morning, everybody. I was hoping we could get a little bit more color on the retirement segments\u2019 earnings and the trend line as you think about it there. If I think about the last couple of quarters before the fourth quarter, after making some adjustments for non-coupon and client activity and better underwriting results et cetera, I think the quarterly pre-tax earnings rate would have been somewhere in the $220 million, the $230 million range. If I make those same adjustments this quarter, I think I am getting to around $205 million, so it\u2019s about a 10% reduction give or take. What\u2019s the better way of thinking about that as we think forward from here? Stephen Pelletier : John, this is Steve Pelletier. I\u2019ll answer that question. When you look at the retirement business, I\u2019d speak to the following areas, first of pressure on the trend line in earnings. First is, as you say from non-coupon investments. That\u2019s experienced across several of our U.S. businesses, but a lot of that impact is concentrated in the retirement business. Second is from lower reinvestment rates, in particular in the full-service business. And again our pressure from lower reinvestment rates is something that works across the U.S. businesses, but shows up to a large extent in full-service. Third has been some degree of record-keeping fee compression, that\u2019s a trend we saw throughout 2015, although we do see it moderating in the latter part of the year. Now, the levers that work the other way, the levers that we manage in the face of those pressures, again it kind of really taking about the full-service business where a lot of this shows up. First, it\u2019s the overall size of the book. We\u2019ve made significant investments in the business over the past couple of years. Those investments have really been around improving service levels and the client experience, the actual participant experience. Those investments have led directly to meaningfully increase sales in the past couple of years and higher persistency. Second is crediting rate management. We\u2019ve done some of that in each of the past couple of years and we have the latitude to take that further as appropriate and necessary. Third is management of unit costs. And a lot of our work around cost efficiency is focused across the board in our businesses, but in full-service as well. For example, some of the references we made to higher expenses in the fourth quarter in the retirement business were actually efficiency charges that we took, charges that we took to prepare for - taking steps that will drive further cost efficiency in that regard. And then finally, our focus on the total economics of a full-service case, including investment management opportunities in a given case. So that\u2019s really where we\u2019re - how we\u2019re looking at the different types of pressures that show up in full-service. Having said that, like I say, the impact from non-coupon and the impact from spread compression shows up to a large degree in that business. Other parts of the retirement business such as pension risk transfer for example, we had a very solid quarter and a very solid year. And we look for further growth and further expansion of our results in those lines. John Nadel : Okay. Thank you for all of that. And I have more of a - maybe just a transactional question, if you will, something that I\u2019m wondering if you might be considering particularly post the BOJ moves and the impact on the JGB curve. You\u2019re in a unique position relative to a lot of your peers and then you have such a large operation in Japan. And a significant exposure to JGB is something order of magnitude $50 billion in U.S. dollars I think. The unrealized gain there must be significant at this point. And I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ve given any thought to monetizing some of those unrealized gains, reinvesting even after tax, reinvesting proceeds into U.S. dollar or other denominated securities hedging back to yen and taking the excess and buying your stock, I mean - or more of your stock. At six times earnings, John, you\u2019re talking about an outlook that sounds so appealing over the long-term. Are there things that you can take advantage of today to reduce your share count? Robert Falzon : So, John, it\u2019s Rob. Let me just take a stab at responding to that. So a couple of thoughts. One, understand, we actually do very actively manage our portfolio. We manage that portfolio in the context of a very-disciplined ALM. And so we would be - want to be careful about doing any kind of restructuring of that portfolio that would cause breakage between what is to be appropriate construct on the asset side particularly from a duration standpoint and an FX standpoint against the liability side. That\u2019s one. Two, we\u2019re also sensitive to not wanting to do mechanical transactions, which on the substance of it would - on the surface of it would appear to have good accounting outcomes, but not change the economic outcome in any way. So we really don\u2019t undertake to play those sorts of games with our portfolio. And then third, I think as we think about stock buybacks, I think I have delivered this message before. And it\u2019s consistent with how we think about it, which is that we are - we think ourselves as very good stewards of our capital capacity. Stock buybacks are an important component of that stewardship. But we think about that in the context of delivering current returns back to our shareholders as a complement to our dividends as opposed to using an opportunistically to speculate on the valuation of our stock vis-\u00e0-vis what\u2019s fair value for that. John Nadel : Okay. Operator : The next question is from Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Tom Gallagher : Hey, just had a question on the variable annuity business. If I look at current market levels and I think about your Highest Daily value product, I think we\u2019re now at the point where you have a lot of the auto rebalance kick in, which I believe starts between 10%, 15% market down levels. Can you can you dimension a little bit what sort of happens mechanically from an accounting standpoint? I realize a big asset reallocation from equities into fixed income, limits the tail risk, but is there - is there like an interim degradation of margins or returns, DAC charges that we should expect if in fact there\u2019s a pretty meaningful movement of the auto rebalance that occurs? Stephen Pelletier : Tom, this is Steve, I\u2019ll address that question. The algorithm and the auto rebalancing mechanism has been active in the face of this kind of market volatility, as you would expect. But it is really designed to manage the risk profile of an individual contract, and thereby, when you add up all those individual contracts, overall risk profile of the product line. It\u2019s not designed to produce any type of change in short-term financial results and current financial results. It\u2019s designed to effectively manage the long-term risk profile of the contract, especially as we\u2019ve communicated in the past, especially tail risk. Tom Gallagher : Got you. But maybe this one is better for, Rob. Just in terms of the way that you would think about the accounting implications, if there was a big kicking in of the auto rebalance in a given quarter, would that necessitate anything real meaningful or is there still an ability to use reversion to mean when you consider normal assume market recovery and money coming back out of those contracts? Can you help frame that a little bit? Robert Falzon : Yes. So I think, Tom, what you\u2019re talking about are EGPs, Estimate Gross Profits, and how that\u2019s going to be affected by the auto rebalance. And in fact as a result of that you get unlock and you get a change in the K factor and the amortization of DAC. Is that sort of the line of thinking you\u2019re chasing? Tom Gallagher : Exactly. Robert Falzon : So the answer would be, no. That does not affect it. Remember that under GAAP, the valuation of our reserves is actually gone in a risk neutral construct. And obviously what we eliminate of the margin piece of that that\u2019s in the GAAP reserve. It\u2019s coming up with our hedge target. That in fact is not affected by the mix in the account values between equities and fixed income because there is a presumption that actually the account values are going to grow at the swap curve rate effectively, a little bit of a premium on the equity side. So while there\u2019s always some level of differentiation associated with that between the equities and the fixed income, it\u2019s not material and we would not expect as a result of changing of the portfolio from the auto rebalance to have a material outcome with regard to an unlock and/or impact on our K factor. Tom Gallagher : That\u2019s helpful. And then just one last follow-up, if I could, if - I don\u2019t know, if you guys have quantified it, the $1 billion gain that you had in deployable capital at year-end. And then, is there a way to at least give a rough estimate of if the quarter closed around current levels would there be a meaningful change in deployable capital, because I think some things have changed in terms of the way you guys have managed particularly the variable annuity business. And I think the volatility should be lower, but I just wanted to get a sense for if you could give some indication on that. Robert Falzon : Well, I would, Tom, reflect back on some of the comments I made in answering Ryan\u2019s initial question, which is, how we think about capital volatility sort of post year-end. And so, as I mentioned, the two biggest drivers of that being AAT and the annuities business. I think I walked through the AAT calculation, which is pro forma, put it back to the end of last year. There\u2019s not a material difference in terms of that outcome. And so therefore, would not have changed capital capacity. The second piece of it on the annuities, as I mentioned there, the - our expectation as a result of the recapture of the risks that we ceded out to our captives is that we will be significantly less sensitive from a capital and leverage standpoint going forward to movements in the market. And so I can\u2019t really comment on where we are in that process and what the exact sensitivity will be, because it\u2019s not completed. But that is in fact the objective of that - or one of the objectives of that undertaking. And therefore, we would expect a level of reduced volatility all around relative to kind of market movements that we see. Tom Gallagher : Got it. And, Rob, when is that expected to be done? Robert Falzon : Well, we haven\u2019t given a specific date, Tom. But it is during the course of 2016 we expect that the recapture would occur and be completed by call it the middle of the year. Tom Gallagher : Okay. Thanks. Operator : The next question is from the line of Suneet Kamath with UBS. Please go ahead. Suneet Kamath : Thanks. Good morning. So I just want to start with the annuity business. I guess, John, you made a pretty strong argument for the sustainability of the variable annuity business industry-wide. But as we think about this vis-\u00e0-vis the DOL, some of your competitors have talked about pretty significant shifts in that business away from upfront commissions to trailing compensation. Just wanted to get your thoughts on how you\u2019re positioned if we move down that road. And if you think we might see a slowdown near-term in terms of sales for the industry as we make that transition. John Strangfeld : Yes. Steve Pelletier will speak to that. Stephen Pelletier : Yes, Suneet. I\u2019ll speak to that. And I\u2019ll speak kind of give another level of detail on how we\u2019re preparing for the DOL to fiduciary standard. We\u2019ve been conducting extensive planning for it. And we expect it to be released in late March, early April. We don\u2019t yet know the details of the final rules, but we are preparing for a full range of contingencies and degrees of potential impact on our businesses. A lot of our planning is focused on annuities, retirement and Prudential Advisors. In annuities, to address your specific questions, we said we\u2019re taking measures to prepare first for increased service requirements on our part in support of our distribution partners; and second, taking steps on the product front. Now, in regard to - in regard to compensation structures and product, I note that we already have had for some time of fee-based options in place in a lot of our existing products. Those structures, those options have had limited uptake as of yet. But as the regulation takes hold, we may see further migration towards those structures. More broadly though and looking forward, we\u2019re going to continue to evolve our product line and our product mix. We have already proven very successful in that sort of diversification over the past couple of years. And we\u2019re going to continue to evolve that product line and mix to extend the franchise and address a larger portfolio of opportunities with, as John mentioned streamlined and simpler solutions. If I could, I\u2019d just touch on retirement and Prudential Advisors as well, because I think it\u2019s important to kind of give the perspective on how we\u2019re seeing the break. In retirement, we will be adapting the communications that we have, that educate plan participants who are retiring or changing jobs on the options that they have for their retirement plan savings. And Pru Advisors, there will be on day one of the regulations effectiveness, there will be an immediate impact on our customer-facing activities. For example, we will - or already adapting our systems for the data collection and compliance that will be part of those customer-facing activities. And part of that, that systems move really entails accelerating the deployment of some technology platforms that we had already long since planned. I will just frame out the point that Prudential Advisors is a very important part of our retail distribution strategy. However, given the way we\u2019ve reshaped our distribution platforms over the past decade or so, it today accounts for only about 20% of our retail life insurance, annuity and mutual fund sales. And so, as I say, I wanted to give you that flavor for the granular preparation we\u2019re taking for the regulation. We do see coming back to your specific question, the potential for some disruption. But we feel that we have the strength of distribution relationships and the skills around distribution support and around product design and development that will enable us to make those necessary adaptations. Suneet Kamath : Okay. And then, just a separate one on expenses, if I did my math right, if I start with your consolidated G&A, so I\u2019m talking about the company level, and I back out your $175 million of overage, it still looks like your G&A is running maybe 4% or 5% above the nine month average. So I guess I just want to make sure as we think about 2016, if there\u2019s anything in terms of the expenses that we should be thinking about that was elevated in 4Q that might persist in the balance of - in remaining quarters of 2016? Robert Falzon : So, Suneet, it\u2019s Rob. I think what we\u2019ve said in the past I think still holds true, which is - actually if we look at our expenses for the entire year, they\u2019re about consistent with what we were expecting, reflecting a number of the initiatives that we have, which are requiring near-term spending. But with that expectation or hope that those things that are outside of enhanced supervision, of which most of it is occurring outside of that, are going to have longer term payoffs in terms of positioning of our businesses and expanding our addressable market. That initiative spending, as I said, is consistent with what we expected for the year on a total-year basis. And when we gave our guidance, I think we mentioned that expectation would be about $0.15 above that level - or the level for 2015 going into 2016. Suneet Kamath : Got it. So just to come back on the guidance and the outlook that you gave, and I know you don\u2019t revisit it, but I think, Rob, what you were saying at the beginning was that sort of everything that happened in the fourth quarter was largely contemplated when you gave that, what it was, 975 to 1025 range. And that other than kind of the macro sensitivities of the equity markets and interest rates, there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s really changed in that line of thinking. Robert Falzon : Yes. Again, not updating, but I would say from a business fundamental standpoint nothing has changed with our regard to our view to that. Obviously, market forces are outside of being able to actually predict that. And then, the usual things that we walk you through from a run rate standpoint around mortality and returns from alternatives, those are variables in the course of the quarter as well. But from a business fundamental standpoint the picture that emerged was consistent with the picture that we were seeing when we established guidance. Suneet Kamath : All right. Thanks. Alan Mark Finkelstein : Roxanne, we\u2019ll take one more question. Operator : That question comes from the line of Michael Kovac, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Michael Kovac : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a high level question here on bank SIFI and we don\u2019t know the rules yet obviously. And the insurance rules are likely going to be different than the bank\u2019s rules. But if you look at some of the macro scenarios that regulators are considering, they\u2019re kind of looking at sort of the recent bank CCAR rules that came out. And they consider equity markets down 50% and the 10-year down below 2% among some of the other things. I imagine that Pru\u2019s running sort of similar analysis today. I\u2019d be curious to know your thoughts and how that does compare to your own stress-test set Prudential runs on its businesses. Robert Falzon : So, Michael, it\u2019s Rob again. The level of stress testing that we see in the CCAR analysis and the sorts of things that we\u2019re talking about internally, there is a high level of consistency there. In fact, I would suggest that actually across the spectrum of risks that we measure, the sort of things that we look at in our tail scenarios are actually more extreme than the sort of things that the banks are being asked to look at in the course of their CCAR test. Some of them are consistent, the equity one that you mentioned. Our assumption when we do our tail scenario is a 50% to 60% decline in equities by way of example to make it comparable. So there is not anything surprising in the way of the regulatory scenarios vis-\u00e0-vis the scenarios that we look at internally. Michael Kovac : That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe a product-specific one, thinking about pension risk transfer market in 2016, how do you think that some of the current macro volatility maybe changes demand on the one front, and then second, potentially the appetite? Stephen Pelletier : I will address that. This is Steve. Our appetite continues to be strong for this business. We have built a position of market leadership based on our capabilities, especially in the large case market. And we look to continue to earn that leadership by advancing a strong value proposition into the market. In terms of market volatility and its impact on plan sponsor, propensity to transact, I would say certainly funding levels have a - the funding levels matter. So impact of market volatility on those levels would matter. But on the other hand, I think that the really expectation now of prolonged low interest rates would also in and of itself make a plan sponsor think about transacting in the sense that the plan sponsor isn\u2019t going to be able to inflate their way out of the issue at all. The rising interest rates and rising discount rates for the liability won\u2019t relieve the matter. I would say that, when we think about the growth in the pipeline over the past couple of years, growth in the industry, and what we see in our pipeline, it\u2019s been driven and will continue to be driven much more by factors that don\u2019t really relate directly to capital markets. And those factors would be : number one, increased awareness and sensitivity to longevity risk and desire to transfer it; and number two, pretty much relentlessly increasing PBGC premiums. That\u2019s what\u2019s been the driver over the past year or two and we would consider those factors to remain drivers in the future. John Strangfeld : And I\u2019ll just add on from a risk - from an appetite standpoint, when we look at the risks associated with that business, particularly the longevity risk, we continue to have plenty of appetite to take on longevity risk, given the size of our mortality book. And with respect to the capital availability, given the numbers that we shared with you as to where we stood at year-end, we have more than adequate capital capacity to continue to pursue the business.

Representing Prudential on today's call are John Strangfeld, CEO; Mark Grier, Vice Chairman; Charlie Lowrey, Head of International Businesses; Steve Pelletier, Head of Domestic Businesses; Rob Falzon, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by John, Mark and Rob, and then we will answer your questions. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of such measures to the comparable GAAP measures and a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, please see the section titled Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measure of our earnings press release, which can be found on our website at www.investor.prudential.com. John, I'll hand it over to you. John Robert Strangfeld - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. While our underlying fundamentals in Q1 remained strong, we were buffeted by market headwinds and our first quarter results trailed our expectations. This quarter's operating earnings per share of $2.26, which excludes market-driven and discrete items, is below the $2.65 we reported in the first quarter of 2015. Our annualized return on equity for the quarter was a little over 12%, or modestly below the 13% to 14% that we target across the cycle. This, of course, will fluctuate on a quarterly basis. At an overall level we produced solid core results. However, the adverse impact of weaker non-coupon investment results, lower average equity markets and foreign currency headwinds drove the year-over-year decline from the particularly favorable results of a year ago. Mark and Rob will walk through the specifics of our key drivers, results and financial measures, I will provide some higher level observations on our businesses and discuss other matters affecting our operations. Our International business had a solid quarter, despite the market challenges I mentioned. We continue to see strong underwriting margins and good core growth at both our Life Planner and Gibraltar businesses. Interest rates in Japan are clearly a challenge and we have made and will continue to make the necessary product and pricing changes to maintain strong returns. I would highlight that our overall constant dollar sales growth of 12% was driven by U.S. dollar products in Japan where we have seen an increase in demand. We also completed the acquisition of an indirect ownership interest in AFP Habitat, a leading Chilean retirement administrator. We're excited about the prospects of this business as we expand our International footprint and expect Habitat to produce steady growth and generate stable earnings and cash flows. It's taken a while to come to fruition, but we believe this investment and relationship is a very good fit for us. Our domestic businesses showed some mixed results, also largely reflecting market factors. At a high level, individual annuities continued to show solid margins, though sales levels have shown some pressure. And this reflects our pricing discipline as well as lower variable annuity sales industry wide. Retirement earnings benefited from another quarter of solid case experience in our pension risk transfer business, which helped mitigate the impact of non-coupon investment returns coming in lower than our average expectation. Let me add, that although we did not close any PRT deals in the quarter, we continue to see solid activity in the market. And as we've discussed on previous calls, the timing and distribution of PRT transactions can be lumpy. Asset management earnings were impacted by lower average equity assets under management and lighter earnings from other related revenues, particularly compared with recent trends. We also experienced weakness in third party unaffiliated net flows, which showed net outflows of about $3 billion for the quarter. To put this in context, however, this follows very strong net flows in 2015 of $22 billion and our pipeline for new mandates is robust. We remain optimistic on our asset management business and continue to invest in capabilities and distribution. But we're also not immune to some of the industry trends that have impacted active equity management strategies. Life insurance earnings were impacted by adverse underwriting results as compared to our average expectations, which is not unusual for us to see in the first quarter. This quarter, we experienced both a greater than typical volume of claims as well as a higher level of claims with larger face values. Over time, we've had significant favorable mortality, including since we acquired Hartford's Life business in 2013, which by the way has proven to be a very good fit. But mortality can vary on a quarterly basis. We continue to show solid sales results which has benefited from product and distribution actions, while maintaining underwriting discipline. And finally, our group insurance business continues to show the benefits to earnings of our multi-year underwriting efforts. We also saw an increase in sales levels following several years of weakness, as we benefited from several large case wins in the quarter. Let me also briefly address a few other topics of interest. In April, we recaptured the variable annuity living benefit riders that were managed in a captive insurer, and now house all of our product risks together in our statutory insurance entities. This is a very important initiative that will meaningfully reduce the volatility in our business and increase transparency, while not having adverse consequences on our capital flexibility. We will provide more details on this initiative with our second quarter results. The decision in favor of MetLife and their challenge to the FSOC designation as systemically important, is a significant development with respect to group supervision and capital standards. We will determine an appropriate path for Prudential, as this issue develops, considering other aspects of group's regulation as well. With respect to FSOC designation, we have options as we go through our annual redesignation process. The fiduciary standard rule issued by the Department of Labor addressed some of the concerns expressed by the industry participants regarding the proposed rule and includes several positive changes. We continue to evaluate the new regulation and potential impacts on our business, which also needs to include consideration of how our distribution partners will respond. The final rule gives us a path forward to implement certain changes to our processes and businesses including in individual annuities, retirement, asset management and our in-house distribution arm, Prudential Advisors. And while there will be challenges with the new rule, we have a history of adapting to change and will continue to support our customers with innovative solutions to meet their retirement needs. In terms of capital deployment, we returned roughly $700 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the quarter, and funded approximately $530 million for our Chilean investment, all while maintaining strong capital flexibility. So to sum it up, while this quarter's results were a little light than we would normally expect, due mainly to market factors, the fundamentals in our business remain sound and we continue to benefit from a strong balance sheet and capital position that enables us to return substantial amounts of capital to shareholders while continuing to support organic and inorganic growth opportunities. With that, I'll turn it over to Mark. Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman : Thank you, John. Good morning, good afternoon, or good evening, and thank you all for joining our call today. I'll take you through our results and then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon, who will cover liquidity, leverage and capital highlights. And I'll start on slide two. After tax adjusted operating income amounted to $2.18 per share for the quarter compared to $2.79 a year ago. After adjusting for market driven and discrete items, EPS was down $0.39 from a year ago. While underlying business performance was solid, the decrease reflected a less favorable macro environment and negative fluctuations in some inherently variable items. Non-coupon investment returns were about $90 million, below our average expectations in the quarter, in contrast to a year ago, when we called out a contribution about $60 million above expectations. Earnings from asset-based fees in our U.S. businesses were about $50 million below the year ago level, largely reflecting the 5% decline in equity market averages. And the contribution from other related revenues in our asset management business, which is largely driven by changes in market values and timing of transactions, was $25 million below the year ago quarter. We estimate that these three items, together with less favorable currency exchange rates, had a negative impact of roughly $0.40 per share on the comparison of results to a year ago. Now moving on to slide three. Returns on non-coupon investments fluctuate over a cycle by their nature. As we mentioned in our earnings guidance call in December, our long term expected returns on these investments are 6% to 7%, with our expectation for 2016 slightly below the long term average. In our case, included in non-coupon or alternative investments, are private equities, hedge funds, real estate, and a $3.6 billion public equity portfolio held mainly in Japan, which includes stocks, mutual funds and J-REITs. These assets totaled about $8.8 billion as of March 31. While these investments diversify our exposure and are a good fit with some of our longer term liabilities, especially in retirement, the pattern of returns introduces some variability into our results. We've called out significant variances from our average expectations, which provided a fairly strong tailwind in 2013 and 2014. However, returns are below the long term expected average in the current quarter. We would estimate that current quarter variances in comparison to our long term average expectations from returns on non-coupon investments, mortality in individual life and International insurance, pension risk transfer case experience, together with the benefit of favorable revenue seasonality in our International Life Planner business had a net negative impact on earnings per share of about $0.10. After adjusting for market driven and discrete items, our EPS of $2.26 for the quarter implies an annualized ROE of 12%. On a GAAP basis, including amounts categorized as realized investment gains or losses and results from divested businesses, we reported net income of $1.3 billion for the current quarter. This compares to just over $2 billion a year ago, which included substantial mark-to-market gains from derivatives and hedging activities. Turning to slide four, for the current quarter, market driven and discrete items consist only of our quarterly market and experience unlocking in the annuities business driven mainly by performance of equities in our customers' accounts, which resulted in a net charge of $0.08 per share. Now, moving to slide five, our GAAP net income of $1.3 billion in the current quarter includes amounts characterized as net realized investment gains of $338 million and divested business results and other items outside of adjusted operating income amounting to net pre-tax gains of $44 million. Of note, product related embedded derivatives and hedging had a positive impact of $282 million in the quarter, driven by the impact of applying credit spreads to our gross GAAP liability balance for variable annuity living benefits, which increased due to the decline of interest rates in the quarter. The gain from other risk management derivatives also came mainly from the decline in interest rates. Impairments and credit losses of $106 million included $85 million from the energy sector, primarily on bonds. Moving to our business results and starting on slide six, I'll discuss the comparative results excluding the market-driven and discrete items that I mentioned. Annuities earnings were $381 million for the quarter, down by $42 million from a year ago. The earnings decrease was mainly driven by a 7% decline in policy charges and fees, reflecting a similar decline in average account values, which was largely driven by equity market levels. Higher expenses and lower non-coupon investment returns, which were modestly below our average expectations, also contributed to the earnings decline and to the decrease in return on assets or ROA, which has fluctuated in the low 100 basis point range. Slide seven presents our annuity sales. Our sales mix continues to reflect our product diversification strategy, which we enhanced in April of last year with an agreement to reinsure about half of the living benefit guarantees on new business related to our highest daily or HD product. This agreement extends through this year. We've also grown sales of our fixed income based PDI product with some recent small adjustments to enhance product attractiveness. As a result, only about one-third of our sales for the current quarter come with retained exposure to equity market linked living benefit guarantees. Turning to slide eight, retirement earnings were $219 million for the quarter, down by $65 million from a year ago. The decrease included a $36 million lower contribution from net investment results. Returns from non-coupon investments were about $40 million below our average expectations in the current quarter versus about $15 million above average expectations a year ago. The decrease in non-coupon returns was partly offset by the impact of growth of the investment base over the past year. The contribution from case experience was about $20 million below the year ago quarter, but roughly $20 million above our average quarterly expectation. The remainder of the earnings decline came mainly from lower fees in our full service business and higher expenses. The sequential quarter in earnings and retirement mainly reflects lower expenses compared to the elevated level of the fourth quarter and a greater contribution from case experience than in the fourth quarter. Turning to slide nine, total retirement gross deposits and sales were $8.7 billion for the current quarter, compared to $7.3 billion a year ago. Standalone institutional gross sales were about $2 billion for the quarter, largely driven by stable value wrap products, compared to sales of roughly $1 billion a year ago, which included about $660 million for a funded PRT case. Full service sales were roughly in line with a year ago. Total retirement account value amounted to $372 billion at the end of the quarter, up by about $7 billion from a year earlier, reflecting net flows of about $5 billion from our full service business and about $2 billion from our institutional standalone business. Turning to slide ten, Asset Management earnings were $165 million for the quarter compared to $205 million a year ago. While most of the segments' results come from asset management fees, the decrease from a year ago was mainly driven by a $25 million lower contribution from other related revenues, reflecting strong strategic investing results and incentive fees in the year ago quarter. The remainder of the earnings decline came mainly from lower asset management fees, driven by a 12% decline in average equity assets under management, which reflected both outflows and negative market impact. Higher fees from management of fixed income assets with a 5% increase in average assets under management, partly offset the equity driven decline. After $22 billion of net positive third party flows in 2015, we experienced outflows of $3 billion in the current quarter, nearly all driven by equity strategies. As John indicated, we are seeing the impact of industry trends including movement to passive strategies as well as some client rebalancing. Turning now to slide 11. Individual life earnings were $120 million for the quarter compared to $125 million a year ago. The decrease in earnings was driven by higher expenses including costs supporting business growth. The net contribution from claims experience was essentially unchanged from a year ago, but about $35 million below our average expectations. Historically, the first quarter has tended to reflect the lower contribution from mortality than the average for the year. The contribution for net investment results was essentially unchanged from a year ago. Lower returns on non-coupon investments, which were about $10 million below our average expectations, were offset by the benefits from a larger investment base. Turning to slide 12, individual life sales based on annualized new business premiums were up $21 million or 17% from a year ago. Guaranteed universal life sales contributed about half of the increase, mainly from greater sales in selected age bands, where we repriced last year to bring our rates more in line with the market. We continually monitor expected returns and competitor actions, and in February, we implemented modest price increases. The remainder of the increase in sales came mainly from Variable Life, where sales tend to be driven by large cases and are lumpy. Moving now to slide 13, group insurance earnings were $26 million for the quarter compared to $30 million a year ago. A lower contribution from investment results with non-coupon returns, about $10 million below our average expectations, together with higher expenses more than offset more favorable underwriting results driven by Group Life. The current quarter total benefits ratio was more favorable than a year ago and within our targeted range of 87% to 91%. Turning to slide 14, Group Insurance sales based on annualized new business premiums were $311 million for the quarter, nearly double the level of a year ago. Most sales occur in the first quarter based on calendar year inception. Following the substantial completion of underwriting and repricing actions we've taken over the last few years, we did see an increase in sales of both Group Life and Group Disability, including more larger cases. Moving now to International Insurance, and turning to slide 15, earnings of our Life Planner business were $410 million for the quarter compared to $439 million a year ago. Excluding a $30 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, earnings are essentially unchanged from a year ago. The benefit to earnings from continued business growth was offset by less favorable mortality experience, higher expenses, including non-linear items such as legal and business development costs and a lower contribution from investment results, including non-coupon investment returns, about $5 million below our average expectations. Mortality experience in the current quarter was essentially consistent with our average expectations, but about $15 million less favorable than a year ago. A concentration of annual mode premium revenues in our Life Planner business results in an earnings pattern that favors the first quarter. We estimate that this benefited current quarter results by about $30 million in relation to a quarterly average. Turning to slide 16, Gibraltar Life earnings were $369 million for the quarter compared to $395 million a year ago. Excluding a negative impact of $28 million on the comparison from foreign currency exchange rates, earnings are essentially unchanged from a year ago. Looking at some key components, the benefits to earnings from business growth, including the initial contribution of our investment in AFP habitat in Chile and more favorable mortality experience in the current quarter, were offset by a lower contribution from investment results of about $40 million. Business growth drove an increase in earnings of about $20 million with about half from Chile, including above average returns on the co-investment in the managed funds otherwise known as the encaje. The contribution to earnings from mortality experience, which was about $5 million more favorable than our average expectations, exceeded the year ago quarter by about $15 million. Net investment results included returns on non-coupon investments, about $20 million below our average expectations in the current quarter, compared to about $40 million above expectations a year ago. This $60 million variance was partly offset by benefits to spread results including higher prepayment income and growth in the base of invested assets. Turning to slide 17, international insurance sales on a constant dollar basis were $781 million for the current quarter, up by $86 million or 12% from a year ago. The increase was driven by our Life Planners in Japan and by Gibraltar's bank channel and life consultants. About 45% of our current quarter sales in Japan were U.S. dollar products compared to roughly one-third of sales a year ago. Life Planner sales in Japan were up by 15% from a year ago, reflecting a 6% increase in agent count, together with higher productivity and higher average premium size. Gibraltar sales were also up by 15% from a year ago. Sales from the bank channel increased by 27%, largely driven by a recurring premium U.S. dollar retirement income product and by death protection products. Life consultant sales increased by 10%, benefiting from a recently introduced U.S. dollar whole life product that has been popular among clients seeking maximum death protection in early contract years. Turning to slide 18, the corporate and other loss was $312 million for the current quarter compared to a $253 million loss a year ago. The main drivers of the increased loss are : lower investment income, reflecting a benefit in the year ago quarter from returns on assets from our closed block restructuring that were subsequently deployed in our businesses; and higher expenses, including items such as legal costs, which can fluctuate; and lower income from our pension plan following our assumption update at year end. Now I'll turn it over to Rob. Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Mark. I'm going to give an update on key balance sheet items, financial measures and other related areas of interest starting on slide 19. As of year-end, Prudential Insurance reported an RBC ratio of 484%, with total adjusted capital, or TAC, of $15 billion. While we don't perform a quarterly bottoms-up RBC calculation, we estimate that our RBC ratio as of the end of the first quarter is well above our 400% target. In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margins of 877% and 929%, respectively, as of their most recent reporting date, December 31, 2015. We expect these ratios to be above our targets as of their fiscal year end on March 31. Looking at liquidity, leverage, and capital deployment highlights on slide 20. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company amounted to $4.1 billion at the end of the quarter. The decline of about $1 billion from year end was driven primarily by our shareholder distributions, debt reduction and acquisition funding. The excess over our targeted $1.3 billion liquidity cushion is available to repay maturing operating debt, to fund operating needs and to deploy over time for strategic and capital management purposes. Our financial leverage and total leverage ratios as of March 31 remained within our targets. During the first quarter, we returned roughly $700 million to shareholders, including $375 million of share repurchases under the $1.5 billion authorization for the year. And in March, we funded the purchase of our stake in AFP Habitat in Chile, with a purchase price of about $530 million. As John noted, we maintained our capital capacity at a level not meaningfully different than what we reported at year-end. Let me provide an update on a few other noteworthy items. The fair value of our yen equity hedge was about $760 million at the end of the quarter, compared to $1.7 billion at year-end. The decline in fair value is, as expected, in response to the 7% strengthening of the yen in relation to the U.S. dollar during the quarter and corresponds to an increase in the U.S. dollar equivalent of yen earnings in Japan over time. Expected cash flows from the yen hedge in 2016 reflect scheduled settlements that are essentially unaffected by the change in fair value. While the fair value of our equity hedge declined sequentially, it continued to operate as designed to protect the value of our businesses and the overall return profile against currency moves in our largest overseas operation. On our energy holdings, our net unrealized loss on the energy sector fixed maturities, excluding the closed block, at the end of the quarter, was about $200 million, essentially unchanged from year-end. 83% of fixed maturities were investment grade. To update you on the variable annuity recapture, on April 1, we recaptured the living benefit risks from our captive reinsurer, moving the rider risks into our statutory insurance companies to be managed together with the base contracts. This marks a major milestone in our initiative, which is on track for completion over the course of the year. Now, I'll turn it back over to John. John Robert Strangfeld - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Rob. Thank you, Mark. And we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator : Thank you. And we will go directly to the line of Erik Bass with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to start with a question on Japan, and I was hoping you could provide some more color on the sales growth this quarter. And for POJ, talk about what's driving the increase in productivity and whether you think sales can continue outpacing Life Planner growth. Charles F. Lowrey - Chief Operating Officer-International & EVP: Sure. So In terms of sales, on the Life Planner side, and then if you want, I can do Gibraltar, but sales were up about 15%. And that's half, as indicated before, due to the Life Planner growth of about 6% and then some due to the productivity. But the Life Planner growth has really come from the sales manager growth, which is really up 7%. And we talked about that for about the past year, where we've increased the number of sales managers. And that has a lag effect but then goes to the increase in Life Planners. So, the real answer is it really is the \u2013 both the productivity and the number of Life Planners that has led to the growth. And there's a little increase in premium, but not really that much. It's mainly the Life Planner growth and the solid growth there. Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. And are you seeing more competition in non-yen denominated products given the drop in JGB yields? Charles F. Lowrey - Chief Operating Officer-International & EVP: We're seeing some increase in competition, but we have such a range of non-yen products \u2013 and it's retirement income, it's whole life, it's fixed annuities \u2013 that we enjoyed a great deal of increase in the sales of the past quarter were in non-yen products. So, there may be more competition, but we're still seeing significant growth in that area. Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. And then, John, if I could just ask one more. I was just hoping that you could expand on your comment that you have options to challenge your SIFI designation or pursue a SIFI off ramp. I was just wondering if you could comment on what are the different mechanisms available to you? John Robert Strangfeld - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think Mark is best to speak to that. Mark? Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman : Yeah. First, with respect to the notion of an off ramp, that's a pretty vague concept that hasn't really been operationalized yet. So I wouldn't be thinking in terms of the options that we might have to reconfigure the company in a way at this point that would make an off ramp a clear option. The reference is primarily to the ongoing designation process, which does involve an annual redesignation, and in the context of the way the annual redesignation works, we retain the ability or the option if we choose to, following a redesignation decision to contest that decision and to contest that decision in court. So, the principal option that's referenced there is the process that we go through every year in redesignation and the fact that options remain open to us as we're redesignated. Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. So you do have a legal option to challenge a redesignation. Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman : Yes. Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, first on the recapture of the VA captive, are you able to discuss what you expect the capital impact of that to be if there is one? Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Jimmy, we expect to be able to cover it more holistically in our second quarter call. I can offer some comments on where we are. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Sure. Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We remain on schedule to recapture VA captive, as I mentioned in my introductory remarks. We're doing that in phases \u2013 the entire project \u2013 through 2016. Recall that the first step of that was actually accomplished last quarter when we got the regulatory approval for our statutory framework. And then the second step is what we've mentioned, which is as of April 1, we've done the actual recapture of the Living Benefit rider from the captive back into the ceding companies. We have some remaining steps in front of us. They're around ALM strategy, around some of our hedging strategies, implementation of those, and then operationalizing and reporting around those as well. I think the important takeaways are that one, we're \u2013 this is part of a broader strategy we have around a priority of reducing volatility in our reported results \u2013 and ensuring that the very strong fundamentals that we have in our businesses are being mapped to and visible in our reported financial results. And I think in the first quarter, you've seen some of the benefits of that in terms of the reduced volatility that we had in our capital numbers in the quarter. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And I'm assuming you're not assuming a huge impact. Obviously, you can't give me precise numbers on your capital, otherwise there would have been either a comment on that or maybe a slowdown in buybacks or something else, right? Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, again, Jimmy, it's a multiphase. And so, simply upon recapture doesn't mean that there's instantaneously the pro forma effect of what we ultimately hope to accomplish with regard to the recapture initiative as opposed to the physical recapture itself. And I think what we've said is, we can accomplish all of this and we're confident in doing so, that there will be no adverse impact to our overall financial resources; and in fact, we expect increased financial flexibility as a result of the completion of the initiative. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then one for Charlie on Japan. How has the depressed JGB yield environment there caused you to change your strategy for the Japanese business if it has, and the type of products that you're avoiding versus the ones that you're pushing more proactively. Charles F. Lowrey - Chief Operating Officer-International & EVP: Well, I think it is affected us obviously over time. We've been dealing with low rates for a long period of time. They're obviously lower now than they were before. But we have, I think, proactively either eliminated products or lowered crediting rates or commissions, and we've been doing that for some period of time. In the last earnings call, I think I articulated that we stopped selling any single premium life or retirement products in the third party channels. And we've reduced crediting rates in some of the \u2013 in our other captive channels. So, we will continue to monitor this very closely. The other way it has affected us, I think, is that we have sold more U.S. dollar products, and we've done that for a couple of reasons. One, as you said, rates are much lower in Japan, so on a relative basis, they're better in the U.S. But also, the appreciation of the yen has led people to think, gosh, with yen I can buy more dollars and therefore U.S. dollar products are more attractive. And with a wide range of suites \u2013 the suite of a wide range of products that we have in the U.S. \u2013 I think our product offering is quite attractive. So we have, if you will, taken advantage of the lower rates by virtue of the products that we offer, and we'll continue to very proactively manage our product mix in order to protect margin. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And the yen denominated business that's on your books, is that earning your targeted returns? Or is it a little bit of a drag versus what you had assumed previously? Charles F. Lowrey - Chief Operating Officer-International & EVP: Well, I think the amount we have on our books is returning what we want. The \u2013 obviously, we're not immune to negative interest rates, and there's some impact on our margins on the new products we sell. But again, we're looking at those products and we're lowering crediting rates and commissions and, in fact, eliminating some products that don't meet our hurdle rates. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, thank you. Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman : Well, and this is Mark. Just remember how much of the profitability in Japan is driven by mortality margins and expense margins, not investment returns. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from the line Suneet Kamath with UBS. Please go ahead. Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Rob, I was hoping you could, as you've done in the past, maybe walk us through the capital capacity walk. I think we ended the year at roughly $4 billion. I think you're saying you're kind of still there, but obviously there's kind of pluses and minuses. So, can you help us fill in the bridge between the two? Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure, Suneet. So, as we've mentioned in the past, our businesses generate a significant amount of capital and there was no change from that in the first quarter. I think we provided sort of rules of thumb that are helpful around that. And that's the fact that about 60% of our operating earnings translated to free cash flow. So, you can think about that. While it varies in any given quarter, you can think about that as being a capital generating capacity in the form of free cash flow. And as I said, that's sort of representative of what we would see over a longer term, but also in the first quarter. There were significant capital deployment actions during the course of the quarter. So, as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, we had about $0.7 billion of shareholder distributions. That was in the form of both share repurchases \u2013 and that's an elevated level. Recall that we increased our buyback program by about $0.5 billion at the end of last year for this year. We increased it from a $1 billion to $1.5 billion. And it was also in dividends. And recall, that we also increased that dividend rate by in excess of 20% last year. So, those were the distributions. We funded about $0.5 billion from our Chilean acquisition. Now, that we had already earmarked from our capital capacity that we articulated at the end of the year, because it was an imminent transaction. So when you think about apples to apples, the Chilean acquisition was already taken out of the capacity number. And so, the remaining variable was the fact that we reduced our debt by about $0.25 billion. It was maturing and we paid that off. So, thinking about sort of going from year-end to the end of this quarter, that you generated internal capital capacity that was sufficient to fund our shareholder distributions. The M&A activity and strategic investments were taken care of in our prior allocation of capital. And you have left the debt reduction, which would be sort of maybe a placeholder for the order of magnitude of change in our total capital capacity from year-end to where we are now. Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then, I guess, on the yen hedge, I had thought on prior calls we had talked about some cash payments moving from Japan to the holding company, as sort of an additional source of flexibility. But now it seems like you're indicating that there's not a significant change in the timing of those cash flows. So, I'm just curious why, given the significant strengthening we've seen in the yen, why wouldn't we expect at some point to see maybe cash flowing from the holding company to the Japanese entities? Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good question. So let me bring that up a level and, if I can, respond to that more holistically. So, first, the hedge is doing exactly what it was designed to do. As and if the yen has depreciated, that has yielded proceeds to us. We've been able to take those proceeds and redeploy them, either in the form of share repurchases or in the form of investments in order to restore the ROE that otherwise would have been lost by virtue of the depreciation in the yen. To your point, as the yen appreciates, you get things that could go the other direction. So, hedge settlements would go instead of from the Japanese companies to the holding company, they would go the other way. However, the point is that ROE is protected in either direction. And we've actually experienced this in the past. The higher yen earnings contribute to sustaining our targeted enterprise ROE because what happens is, over time, our yen earnings are higher. It creates greater dividend capacity, and that translates ultimately into greater U.S. dollar dividends coming back to us. So, when we actually think about that yen hedge, it creates capital capacity when there's a depreciating yen. When there's an appreciating yen, what happens is we have something that I would consider to be more of a liquidity issue. Which is we temporarily have to fund the mark on those going down to the Japanese companies, but that ultimately works its way back to us in the form of higher earnings and greater dividends coming back to the holding company. Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC : But in terms of that lag, you're not expecting a big liquidity draw on holding company resources until you wait for those higher earnings from Japan to send cash back. I mean, there's a timing issue, but you're not expecting a big change in terms of that holding company liquidity, right? Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That would be correct. So, two thoughts on that. First, with regard to this year particularly, as I alluded to in my introductory remarks, we actually have locked in our settlements for this year. So, we have about $0.5 billion for the entire year of pre-tax gains that are locked in for the year and in fact will be coming our way, regardless of what happens to the yen rate during the course of this year. That's one. Two, the settlements beyond this year are actually staged out over long periods of times. And that is \u2013 and actually with the intent of trying to match up dividend paying capacity against settlements that we might otherwise have against those hedges. So, we're actually very conscious of that and ensuring that it doesn't create a short-term liquidity dislocation. Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, thanks, Rob. Operator : And we'll now go to the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Your line is open. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I have a follow up question for Mark on the FSOC potential to legally contest. In terms of your legal right, are you \u2013 if you were to contest the redesignation, does that legally only apply to the specific redesignation process or does it allow you to essentially legally contest the entire designation to begin with? Alan Mark Finkelstein - Senior Vice President & Head- Investor Relations : No, it's the whole designation. I mean, technically that redesignation is a renewal of the original designation. So, we're talking about the same thing. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Got it. And then quick one, do you have anything you can provide in terms of earnings expectations for the Habitat deal now that it's closed? Charles F. Lowrey - Chief Operating Officer-International & EVP: Um, I think what we have said is that the \u2013 we closed on March 1 and that the \u2013 we're very pleased with what we have so far in terms of earnings. Now, one month does not an acquisition make. And those earnings are in part coming from the stable cash flow and the dividends that come up. And part of it is from the encaje. And obviously, with the encaje having invested March 1, that was a good time to invest, given the quarter. So, we're pleased with the first quarter. It meets our original assumptions and return expectations and we'll see how it goes from here. Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And this is Rob. The only thing I'd add to Charlie's comments is that, I think, as we've communicated, when we made this investment, this investment was accretive to what we viewed to be our hurdle rate ROE. So, when you sort of think about the returns that we expect to get on this, you can look at what we've paid for it, think about the ROEs that we expect to generate; that would give you an indication of what would be a sustainable level of ongoing earnings coming out of that investment. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Got it. Thank you. Operator : Next we have a question from the line of Sean Dargan with Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead. Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. I know the PRT business is lumpy, but can you give us any more color on what you saw there in the first quarter and maybe if anything's changed due to market dislocation year to date? Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit, Prudential Financial, Inc.: Sean, this is Steve. I'll address your question and thanks for it. We don't see any fundamental changes in PRT market dynamics. We think that the propensity to transact is still very strong. When it comes to interest rates, a big impact on propensity to transact is not just what rates are today, but what is a plan sponsor's expectations about rates in the future. And we see increasingly, a reduced expectation that rising rates will address the liability. So, we still see healthy propensity to transact. Obviously, market conditions have, in some cases, impacted funding levels, but we've also seen, especially in the large case market that we specialize in, we've seen plan sponsors undertake steps to protect those funding levels through various types of hedging instruments. Not with us, but in their investment activities. So, like I say, we still see healthy pipeline. I will mention that since the close of the quarter, we have announced a longevity deal in the UK with Legal & General of less than $500 million. So as I said, we still see healthy pipeline. And when you consider the increasing awareness of the longevity risk, when you consider the rising PBGC premiums, we still see lots of inclination for plan sponsors to pursue this solution. Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Thank you. And if I could just ask one about the non-coupon investment income, other liability driven investors are rethinking their allocations to the hedge funds, given some of the performance issues and the volatility they introduce. I'm just wondering if you can give us some color on what your outlook in the medium term for hedge fund allocation is? Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So Sean, of our $8.8 billion alternatives portfolio, hedge funds are a little over $1 billion of that, so about $1.1 billion. So, a little bit more than 10% of the portfolio in hedge funds, so not an overweight allocation to that. Within that portfolio, we've got some 40 different funds. They're diversified by strategy, by asset class, geography, their sources of the alpha that they generate and the level of hedging that they undertake to do. We're actually quite pleased with the portfolio. We would look at the first quarter results as being something that would be kind of an outside of a couple standard deviations of expectation, that normally within a body of distribution around what would be volatility in the market, we would actually expect our hedge funds to mute volatility as contrasted to what you saw across the entire industry, including in our portfolio in the first quarter. So, we think we have a very carefully designed portfolio that we're actually quite pleased with, and we remain committed to retaining that as a portion of our alternatives portfolio. Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : And next, we'll go to the line of Eric Berg with RBC. Please go ahead. Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. I have a question about the \u2013 just one question today \u2013 about the growing number of market participants, and this was referenced earlier, who are selling dollar denominated investments, both annuities and life insurance in Japan. It just strikes me as curious, and I guess this is more of a question of a cultural rather than a financial nature, but what is it about Japan and Japanese nationals that lead to the interest in these products exposing the customers to FX risk? I presume that in the typical transaction the customer is not hedging the customer's foreign exchange risk. It's exposed therefore to the possibility that down the road, either when the customer retires or the customer dies, the family will receive less money than the customer thought because of a weakening of the yen, the customer's family receives or customer in retirement receives dollar investments. What's your sense of why the customers are willing to take this FX risk? I guess I'd wrap up the question by saying I can't imagine if we sold yen denominated life insurance in the United States, it would be nearly as successful as your dollar denominated products there. Charles F. Lowrey - Chief Operating Officer-International & EVP: Well, I think the last comment you made is absolutely correct. I think the issue with Japanese consumers is one of having lived with a low interest rate environment for a long, long period of time and looking at the interest rate differential with the U.S. And yes, you are right. They do take the FX risks. But over time, what they believe and what their experience frankly has been, is that the FX risk is not as great as the interest rate differential and therefore they're willing to do that. You've seen it with the U.S. dollar product and you've seen it with the Aussie dollar product. And they're very savvy, because they'll go back and forth from time to time. Now, most of the product we sell, as Mark suggested, is life insurance based, it's protection based. So they buy it for different reasons. It's not savings products, per se. But they do look at the interest rate differential and then make decisions accordingly, and they have for a long period of time because they've been living in an environment where those differentials in interest rates between Japan and then the U.S. and Australia have been there for a long period of time. Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Very clear. Thank you. Oh, you're going to say something else? Go ahead. I'm sorry. Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman : Eric, also keep in mind that retail investors in Japan don't take a lot of other risks. They're very conservative in saving in the mattress as opposed to buying stocks for example. So this is one place where they just may choose to take risk instead of other places. Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you, Mark. Operator : And next, we'll go to the line of Steven Schwartz with Raymond James. Your line is open. Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi, good morning everybody. First, a question on the alternatives. Mark, I think you said that your expected return on your non-coupon investment portfolio is 6% to 7%. Is that pre-tax or after tax? Alan Mark Finkelstein - Senior Vice President & Head- Investor Relations : Pre-tax. Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman : Pre-tax. Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. That strikes me as awfully low compared at least to how other companies talk about the expected returns on their alternative investment portfolios. I was hoping maybe you could touch on that; maybe it's mix or something like that? Maybe it's Japanese equities? I don't know. Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, Steven, it's Rob. I'd say a couple things in response to that. One is, those are our actuarial expected returns as opposed to what our portfolio managers would expect. I would think our portfolio managers would concur with you. They're expectation is actually to produce a higher return, but when we build in our returns for budgeting and forecasting purposes and for purposes of communicating to you, we think about a level of conservatism in that. And those are the numbers that we express. That would be one. Two, yes, if you look at the overall composition of our portfolio, you would say that it's got a conservative tilt to it. As I mentioned before, with respect to the hedge funds, our expectation with the hedge funds is to mute volatility as opposed to produce outsized returns. And then, similarly with respect to what we've got in our private equity allocation, which is about a quarter of the total alternatives budget, we look at that as \u2013 we don't take what you would consider to be sort of venture capital risk in our private equity \u2013 but rather more traditional private equity which would be further in in the risk spectrum. Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, and thanks for that. And then moving on to asset management. I was interested, of the $166 billion, I think it was, of AUM that you have in equities, could you discuss maybe the split between what may be considered beta products as opposed to alpha products? Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit, Prudential Financial, Inc.: Steven, this is Steve Pelletier. I'll address your question. I would say that if you look at our equity business overall, it is a business of active management. I would characterize it in two buckets. First, is our quantitative management. That's an area that we've been building out significantly over the past several years and we look to continue to do so. The other bucket is our fundamental equity management business, in particular, U.S. large cap growth. But increasingly, over the past couple of years we've been seeking to diversify that fundamental equity management business, also including areas such as International and global. So, we don't look to intend to get straight into the passive space. We think that's a space very well spoken for. But... Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, Steve? Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit, Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yes. Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: If I can interrupt because I may have put the question wrong. I guess what I really wanted to know is how much of that business do you think is at risk of moving to a beta strategy? Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit, Prudential Financial, Inc.: Well, we have seen the pressure, especially on actively managed equities. And like I say, we don't intend to address that challenge by going head-on into pure passive products, but we look to diversify our active management capabilities, both on the quantitative side and on the fundamental side. Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. All right. Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit, Prudential Financial, Inc.: And we're investing in the business to achieve that. Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. I appreciate that. Thanks guys. Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit, Prudential Financial, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. And we'll now go to Randy Binner with FBR Capital. Please go ahead. Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Hey, thanks. I guess I'm going to ask the DoL question that hasn't come up yet. And so, we've had calls with some other folks this morning and the basic concept that I think we're all trying to get to is, if you are primarily a manufacturer of variable annuities, which is the case, and you look forward to when you're going to be selling these Vas post-implementation of the DoL rule, that would be under the best interest contract. And so, it's kind of a two-part question. One, do you think that the distributor rather than the manufacturer would be the one who is a party to the legal risk of the best interest contract? And if that is the case, can you characterize your conversations with your distribution thus far and kind of how constructive they are so far on being able to sell VAs under the BIC? Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit, Prudential Financial, Inc.: Randy, it's Steve again. I'll address your question. I'm not going to get into an apportionment of legal liability. I'm sure you understand that. But I would say that \u2013 I would point out that manufacturers will have a responsibility to perform certain processes and provide certain information to distributors so that they can fulfill their obligations under the contract. And we are making the necessary preparations to do exactly that. I think if I could, just to address some other questions that I know have come up on other calls regarding the DoL, just to make some broader comments. The final rule does contain some meaningful improvements. We still think it creates significant challenges and changes in the industry as a whole. It can increase compliance costs, although I would say that that's not an overly consequential matter for a company of our size. And it can also contain, as you were pointing out, increased exposure to legal claims. As such, we think it's more important than ever to really avoid those unintended consequences that we spoke about last summer on Investor Day, and insure continued access to education, advice, and product solutions. That's the position we've taken consistently and we'll continue to do so. If you look at our three businesses most impacted on Prudential Advisors \u2013 and here I'm more talking about the differences between the original regulation and the final one \u2013 if you look at Prudential Advisors, the final rule did make the process for obtaining the required contract under the BIC exemption less onerous than it originally was. And it also permits us to deal on a negative consent basis with clients who had accounts established prior to the beginning of 2018. So that's helpful. Final rule, also clarified how proprietary products can be sold to IRA owners, providing we address some significant new requirements. Again, that's useful. So, for Prudential Advisors, compliance and business processes will change, and we'll be ready for those changes. And we fully expect that unit to continue to play an important role in our distribution strategy. For annuities, and you touched upon this in your question, Randy, the DoL did attempt to clarify the circumstances under which higher compensation for the sale of more complex products requiring more upfront time by the advisor is permissible, so long as that compensation is reasonable. And what that means will play out over time. The final rule did not include an exemption that would have favored lower cost products, such as index funds over higher cost, higher value products. And so, while these changes could help mitigate adverse impact on the VA sales, we do want to emphasize, we think it's really still premature to offer any predictions as to what that impact will be. That's going to play out over multiple years through the lens of advisor behavior and firm behavior. So we'll see what that proves out to be. For Prudential Retirement, the third business I'd mention, the final regulation does contain meaningfully clearer delineation between investment advice and investment education, and we think that delineation will allow us to continue to offer our asset allocation services to DC plans. It's come up on other calls about the sales exception for plans with 100 and more participants. In the original rule that was changed to a $50 million or above in assets exemption or threshold. The bulk of our business focuses in the larger case market and we expect the vast preponderance of our business to continue to qualify for either exemption threshold. Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: All right. Thank you. That was really comprehensive. I just wanted to clarify though, as the manufacturer, while you have a lot of responsibilities as you laid out, it's not \u2013 you are not the signatory, if you will, to the BIC? That's still \u2013 that rests with \u2013 the distribution is the financial institution? Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : They're the signatory to the BIC, but as I say, manufacturers will be expected to do certain things and provide types of information to support the distributor in fulfilling those obligations. Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: All right. Thank you very much. Alan Mark Finkelstein - Senior Vice President & Head- Investor Relations : Christie, we have time for one more question. Operator : Yes we do. We'll go to the line of Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead. Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Just one follow-up question related to the other related revenue in asset management. I understand that line item could be \u2013 could fluctuate from time to time. And my \u2013 at least my understanding is \u2013 in the first quarter, at least one of your peers talked about there's a slowdown in commercial mortgage loan origination activities and that hurt their similar type of fee revenue for the quarter. Do you see something similar in this quarter? And if so, how is the second quarter to date kind of trending in terms of commercial mortgage loan activities? Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit, Prudential Financial, Inc.: Humphrey, this is Steve again. That really wasn't a factor in our ORR results, our other related revenue results. The year-on-year decline that Mark cited in his review was really driven by performance and incentive fees, which were impacted by market turbulence and by strategic investing, which was also impacted by market turbulence. Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC : Got it. And then, in terms of kind of thinking on a normalized basis, again, I understand you don't provide explicit guidance for this line of items. But, what would be more of a trendable or more sustainable level that \u2013 at least for modeling purposes? Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit, Prudential Financial, Inc.: Humphrey, I would just describe the recent trend and the recent quarterly trend in this category has been about $30 million. Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 3 :00 today through May 12, 2016. You may access the AT&T replay system at any time by dialing 1-800-475-6701 and entering the access code 383123. International participants, please dial 320-365-3844.

Kamath - UBS Securities LLC Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Prudential quarterly earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, the conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Mark Finkelstein. Please go ahead. Alan Mark Finkelstein - Senior Vice President & Head- Investor Relations : Thank you, Don. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today's call are John Strangfeld, CEO; Mark Grier, Vice Chairman; Charlie Lowrey, Head of International Businesses; Steve Pelletier, Head of Domestic Businesses; Rob Falzon, Chief Financial Officer and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by John, Mark and Rob, and then we will answer your questions. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of such measures to the comparable GAAP measures and a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Please see the section titled forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measure of our earnings press release which can be found on our website at www.investor.prudential.com. John, hand it over to you. John Robert Strangfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will provide some high-level observations on the quarter and the fundamental trends in our businesses. I will then briefly discuss actions we've taken to improve our capital flexibility and reduce volatility, which directly led to last evenings announcement of a $500 million increase in our share repurchase authorization for 2016. In closing, I will comment on the regulatory environment and then hand it over to Mark and Rob. We continue to successfully navigate a challenging environment. We benefit from a collection of businesses that fit well together and provide diverse sources of earnings and cash flows. We are therefore able to generate solid results despite market volatility and broader macro uncertainties. At the same time, we're also generating considerable excess capital. We are reinvesting in our operations to capitalize on longer-term growth opportunities as well as returning substantial amounts of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Notably, we returned about $1.4 billion to shareholders in the first half of 2016 alone. Now, specific to the quarter, reported earnings were impacted by several significant items. This includes the outcome of our annual review of actuarial assumptions and other reserve refinements. Although this annual review had a positive impact on our overall results, it had an adverse effect on adjusted operating income. This is largely due to a change we took in our Individual Life business related to a recent interpretation of accounting guidance. Mark will discuss this and other factors influencing reported earnings in more detail. If you exclude the impact of our annual review and other market-driven and discrete items, adjusted operating earnings per share would have been $2.46, which is in line with our expectations for the quarter. Annualized return on equity, on the same basis for the quarter, at just over 13%, was also consistent with our longer-term target. In terms of growth drivers, we produced good sales and flows across our domestic and international businesses in the quarter. This is while continuing to take actions to adjust our product offering and pricing to reflect a lower and in some cases negative interest rate environment. Turning to the fundamentals in our businesses, our international operations produced solid results. We reported solid core growth and underwriting margins in both our Life Planner and Gibraltar businesses. While the level of interest rates in Japan is a real challenge, and has necessitated aggressive product and pricing actions, including the suspending the sales of certain yen-based products, we still produced 7% constant currency sales growth in our overall international operations in the quarter. This was led by our U.S. dollar product sales in Japan, which increased 53% over the prior year. And for the first time in our history, our Japanese operations sold more U.S. dollar products than yen-based products. This shows the benefit of our broad suite of protection-based products and their distribution strength. Our domestic businesses also produced solid results and generally good sales and net flow trends. PGIM, our Asset Management business, had strong results reporting very good earnings and robust net inflows of $3.6 billion. PGIM, again, exceeded $1 trillion in total AUM. And we're particularly pleased that third-party unaffiliated institutional and retail assets under management crossed the $500 billion threshold for the first time. We continue to be optimistic about PGIM's prospects and are investing in expanding capabilities and distribution. Our Retirement and Individual Annuity businesses performed largely in line with our expectations. Retirement closed on two significant UK longevity pension risk transfer cases in the quarter and produced overall positive net flows. As we've mentioned in the past, the timing of PRT transactions can be lumpy but we continue to believe this is a good long-term growth business and expect to benefit from our best-in-class platform. I would also highlight that Retirement earnings again reflected pension risk transfer case experience more favorable than our average expectations. While we may have quarters in the future in which this isn't the case, the underwriting experience of the PRT block has well exceeded our expectations. Our U.S. protection trends are mixed. Group Insurance produced very good underwriting margins with a benefit ratio in the quarter modestly more favorable than our target range. Group Insurance is also showing improved top line growth, following a multiyear effort focused on improving underlying results. Conversely, while Individual Life Insurance produced good sales growth, we did experience adverse mortality that dampened earnings. Mortality results have clearly disappointed in the first half of 2016, though this will fluctuate on a quarterly basis. And the longer-term mortality trend has been very good. Now I'll briefly cover the structural changes we made in managing the risks of our variable annuity business. But before doing so, I want to provide some perspective on how this project fits into our broader strategic focus as a company. Over the last couple of years, we have focused intently and intensely on simplifying our business, improving our transparency and reducing volatility. We believe that over time a clear line of sight to our business fundamentals should contribute to a more valuable franchise. In this regard, you've seen us take a number of actions. As a result of the substantial completion of our variable annuity restructuring, we expect a meaningful reduction in our capital volatility in our Individual Annuities business and increased stability and certainty of cash flows generated from the business. We believe that Individual Annuities should become a significant source of free cash flow in the future. And at the same time, we continue to manage the business to robust standards focused on the economics of the risk. And we're particularly pleased that the economic synergies achieved from this action has led to a release of capital and facilitated last evening's announced increase in our share repurchase authorization by the board. Rob Falzon will have more to say on this topic. Finally, on the regulatory front, we are preparing a response to the Federal Reserve on the recently issued advance notice of proposed rulemaking or ANPR that addresses capital requirements for supervised insurance entities. And the NPR focused on corporate governance, risk management and liquidity standards. While these proposals still have a ways to go until they reach the finish line, we are encouraged by the dialogue and the focus by the Fed on seeking to appropriately reflect the unique characteristics of insurance companies into a properly designed set of standards. With that, I'll hand it over to Mark. Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman : Thanks, John. Good morning, good afternoon or good evening. Thank you all for joining the call today. I'll take you through our results, and then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon, who will cover liquidity, leverage and capital highlights. Starting on slide 2, after-tax adjusted operating income amounted to $1.84 per share for the quarter compared to $2.91 a year ago. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, EPS of $2.46 was down $0.16 from year ago. Underlying business performance remained solid through the challenging macro environment. The decrease reflected a number of moving parts, but I would highlight a greater loss from corporate and other operations driven by negative fluctuations in expenses and investment income and less favorable claims experience in comparison to the outperformance we called out in the year-ago quarter. We estimate that these two items, together with less favorable currency exchange rates, had a negative impact of roughly $0.25 per share on the comparison of results to a year ago. Current quarter variances in comparison to our average expectations for mortality in Individual Life and International Insurance, pension risk transfer case experience and returns on non-coupon investments were largely offsetting. Favorable revenue seasonality in International Insurance contributed about $0.04 per share to earnings. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, our EPS of $4.72 for the first half of 2016 implies an annualized ROE of just under 13%. This includes a modest net negative impact from variances compared to average expectations for the items I mentioned, together with favorable International Insurance revenue seasonality. On a GAAP basis, including amounts categorized as realized investment gains or losses, and results from divested businesses, we reported net income of $921 million for the current quarter, about $90 million above our after-tax adjusted operating income. GAAP net income included a net favorable impact from our annual actuarial review for items we account for outside of AOI, which I will discuss further. Turning to slide 3, this year's annual actuarial review including reserve updates and refinements for our ongoing businesses, resulted in a net favorable pre-tax impact of $590 million, including a benefit of about $1 billion outside of AOI, partly offset by net charges in AOI totaling $444 million. The non-AOI benefit to earnings was mainly driven by an update of our utilization assumptions related to the amount of income payouts taken under our annuities living benefit guarantees based on emerging experience. While we reduced our long-term interest rate assumptions as part of the annual review, this did not have a meaningful impact on the outcome. The charge that was included in AOI came mainly from Individual Life, driven by a recent interpretation of accounting guidance relating to the expected pattern of earnings on the Universal Life block of business that we acquired from Hartford. Under this guidance, we are recording a reserve now to reflect the period of losses that we expect to emerge about 15 years in the future after our expected returns have been largely realized. It's worth noting that the majority of these losses were assumed in our original forecast at the time of the Hartford acquisition. Turning to slide 4. The remainder of market-driven and discrete items for the quarter consists of a benefit from our quarterly market and experience unlocking in the annuities business driven mainly by performance of equities in our customer accounts and a charge in Corporate and Other for cost of our $500 million debt tender offer in June. Moving on to slide 5. Our GAAP net income of $921 million for the current quarter includes amounts characterized as net realized investment gains of $360 million. And divested business results and other items outside of AOI amounting to net pre-tax losses of $68 million. Of note, product related embedded derivatives and hedging had a positive impact of $574 million. This includes the favorable impact of the annual actuarial review on annuities living benefits that I mentioned, partly offset by an increase in the gross GAAP liability balance for these living benefits which was driven by the decline in interest rates in the quarter. The loss from other risk management activities was mainly driven by true-ups reflecting our annual review. Impairments and credit losses of $51 million were the lowest of the past four quarters and about half the level of the first quarter. Moving to our business results and starting on slide 6, I'll discuss the comparative results excluding the market-driven and discrete items that I have mentioned. Annuities earnings were $375 million for the quarter, down $48 million from a year ago. The earnings decrease was mainly driven by a 7% decline in policy charges and fees reflecting a roughly similar decline in average account values. Higher expenses also contributed to the earnings decline and the decrease in return on assets or ROA. ROA was modestly below 100 basis point range of the past few quarters. Slide 7 presents our annuity sales. Total sales are largely unchanged from a year ago. However, our mix of sales has changed dramatically over the past year reflecting our diversification strategy. Sales of our fixed income based PDI product reached a record high of over $1 billion in the quarter, reflecting market demand and the success of our product diversification efforts. In addition, we're externally re-ensuring about half of the living benefit guaranty on new business related to the Highest Daily or HD product under an agreement which extends through this year. As a result, less than one third of our sales for the current quarter come with retained exposure to equity market linked living benefit guarantees. Turning to slide 8, Retirement earnings were $230 million for the quarter, down $7 million from a year ago. The decrease reflects the lower contribution from case experience which was about $20 million more favorable than our average quarterly expectations, but below the level of the year-ago quarter. In addition, lower fees in our Full Service business were largely offset by a modestly greater contribution from net investment results. Returns from non-coupon investments were about $30 million below our average expectations in the quarter. Turning to slide 9, total Retirement gross deposits and sales were $8.1 billion for the current quarter compared to $14.2 billion a year ago which included three significant pension risk transfer transactions totaling about $7 billion. Standalone institutional gross sales were $3.4 billion for the quarter including about $2 billion from two new longevity reinsurance cases. Net flows for the quarter were positive both in Full Service and Institutional Investment Products totaling about $500 million. Turning to slide 10, Asset Management earnings were $207 million for the quarter compared to $196 million a year ago. While most of the segment's results come from asset management fees, the increase from a year ago was mainly driven by a $9 million greater contribution from other related revenues, reflecting more favorable strategic investment results and higher real estate transaction fees. Earnings driven by Asset Management fees were essentially unchanged from a year ago. Higher fees for management of fixed income assets were largely offset by lower fees tied to equities. The Asset Management business reported $3.6 billion of net positive, third-party flows in the quarter with contributions from institutional and retail businesses each driven by fixed income flows. Turning to slide 11, Individual Life earnings were $130 million for the quarter, compared to $177 million a year ago. The decrease in earnings came mainly from a negative fluctuation in claims experience with the current quarter contribution to earnings about $20 million below our average expectations compared to a strong year ago quarter. While mortality experience can vary from one quarter to another, it has been more favorable than our average expectations for each of the full years 2013, 2014 and 2015. In addition, in Individual Insurance, expenses were slightly higher in the current quarter than a year ago. Turning to slide 12, Individual Life sales based on annualized new business premiums were up $29 million or 22% from a year ago. Guaranteed Universal Life sales contributed just under half of the increase reflecting current-quarter sales resulting from an accelerated flow of policy applications in advance of recently implemented price increases. The remainder of the increase came mainly from variable life where sales tend to be driven by large cases and are lumpy. Turning to slide 13, Group Insurance earnings were $48 million for the quarter, essentially unchanged from a year ago. The current quarter total benefits ratio was consistent with the year-ago quarter and modestly more favorable than our targeted range of 87% to 91% with current-quarter disability underwriting results at the strongest level of the past four quarters. Moving to International Insurance and turning to slide 14, earnings for our Life Planner business were $381 million for the quarter compared to $392 million a year ago. Excluding a $22 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, earnings increased by $11 million from a year ago. The benefit to earnings from continued business growth was partly offset by higher expenses including costs supporting business growth and a lower contribution from investment results driven by declining fixed income returns. Mortality experience in the current quarter was essentially unchanged from a year ago and about $10 million more favorable than our average expectations. The concentration of annual mode premium revenues in our Life Planner business that results in an earnings pattern favoring the first quarter drove the sequential quarter earnings decline. Turning to slide 15, Gibraltar Life earnings were $494 million for the quarter compared to $471 million a year ago. Excluding a negative impact of $36 million on the comparison from foreign currency exchange rates, earnings increased by $59 million from a year ago. Current quarter results include a benefit of about $40 million from the sale of a home office property that came to us with the acquisition of Star and Edison. This sale substantially completes the realization of synergies from integration of the business infrastructure. The remainder of the earnings increase was driven by business growth, largely reflecting the first full quarter contribution of our investment in AFP Habitat in Chile which was essentially in line with our expectations and also reflecting a greater contribution from net investment results. Net investment results for the quarter included returns on non-coupon investments, about $35 million more favorable than our average expectations driven by real estate sale within an investment fund. A concentration of annual mode premium revenues favors second-quarter results for Gibraltar Life. We would estimate that the benefit to current-quarter earnings in relation to a quarterly average was about $30 million. Turning to slide 16, International Insurance sales on a constant-dollar basis were $747 million for the current quarter, up by $50 million or 7% from a year ago. The sales growth was driven by a 53% increase in our sales of U.S. dollar products in Japan which more than offset lower Yen-based sales. U.S. dollar products comprised more than half of our current-quarter sales in Japan compared to roughly one third of sales a year ago. Our exposure to declining interest rates in Japan is mitigated by our emphasis on protection products with the returns largely driven by mortality and expense margins and by strong asset liability management for our in-force business. We've taken significant actions to maintain appropriate expected returns for new business in the current environment in Japan, including reductions in crediting rates and commissions and in some cases sales suspensions for yen products that are most affected by interest rates. These are generally those with the greatest cash value accumulation features including certain single premium products. Our success in continuing to grow sales in Japan while adapting the product portfolio reflects the skills of our life planners and life consultants and matching our products with client needs and the enhanced attractiveness of our U.S. dollar products to Japanese consumers in the current environment. Life Planner sales in Japan were up 19% from a year ago reflecting an 8% increase in agent count together with higher productivity and higher average premium size. Gibraltar sales were up by 6% from a year ago including a 15% increase from our life consultants. Bank channel sales were consistent with a year ago, reflecting a $27 million increase in U.S. dollar sales, essentially offsetting a decrease in yen-based sales. Turning to slide 17, the Corporate and Other loss was $376 million for the current quarter compared to a $305 million loss a year ago. The main drivers of the increased loss are; lower investment income reflecting a charge of about $40 million from the declining value of a tax-advantaged investment that we account for under the equity method. Higher expenses including items such as fixed asset disposals, legal costs and employee benefit costs all of which can fluctuate. And lower income from our pension plan following our assumption update at year-end. Now I'll turn it over to Rob. Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Mark. I'm going to cover an update on key balance sheet items, financial measures and other related areas of interest starting on slide 18. You'll notice a change in how we present the comparison of RBC to our target. As of April 1, we recaptured the living benefit risk from our reinsurance captive. Most of the economics and risks of our variable annuity contracts now reside in a single statutory entity we call PALAC, which was the direct writer of a substantial portion of our in-force annuity business. As a result, a meaningful portion of our statutory capital has migrated to PALAC and is no longer rolling up to the RBC of Prudential Insurance under statutory accounting. We now view composite RBC, which includes our U.S. insurance entities on a comprehensive basis, as a more meaningful measure of our statutory financial strength in relation to our benchmark. On this basis, composite RBC at year-end 2015 was 486%, and we estimate that it is well above our 400% target at the end of the second quarter. In Japan, Prudential Japan and Gibraltar reported strong solvency margins of 801% and 928%, respectively, as of March 31 their fiscal year-end. These solvency margins are comfortably above our targets. Let me provide a few additional points on the variable annuity recapture. As of August 1, all of the risks of our annuities contracts are managed within the annuities business. As a result, the historic management of a portion of the interest rate risk of our annuities guarantees at the holding company has been closed out. We are now managing all of the product risks by holding derivatives and other financial assets in our statutory entities. In addition, we will continue to manage the product risks of our annuities businesses as we have done historically on an economic basis. This includes the ability to maintain a CTE 97 threshold in moderate stress scenarios, consistent with how we manage risks across our businesses, standards that we believe are consistent with AA financial strength. Further, due to synergies that occur when all the product risks are managed together, we're able to release about $1 billion of capital from our annuities business. The outcome of this restructuring substantially simplifies our annuities operation, reduces our capital volatility and increases the certainty around cash flows from the annuities business. Looking at the liquidity, leverage and capital deployment highlights on slide 19, our cash and liquid assets at the parent company amounted to $4 billion at the end of the quarter, essentially unchanged from March 31. This reflects the impact of cash inflows including the $1 billion related to the annuities restructuring that I mentioned, in addition to a dividend from PICA. It is net of the return of about $700 million to shareholders including $370 million of share repurchases and the repayment of about $1 billion of debt including $500 million under our tender offer in June. Our financial leverage and total leverage ratios as of June 30 remained within our targets. Consistent with our balanced approach to capital management and deployment, the capital released as a result of our annuities actions supported a $500 million increase in our share repurchase authorization for the second half of this year, bringing the authorization for 2016 to $2 billion, of which $750 million has been executed through June 30. Those of you who have followed our historical dividend pattern are accustomed to seeing a review of our dividend level in the fourth quarter. While we evaluate shareholder distributions with the board in every quarter, we expect to move the routine dividend evaluation process to the first quarter in order to better align with our capital planning cycle. Now I'll turn it back over to John. John Robert Strangfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Rob. Thank you, Mark. And let's open it up to questions. Operator : And first we're going to the line of Ryan Krueger, KBW. Please go ahead. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I had a question about the annuity ROA; it dipped down a bit to 98 bps in the quarter from kind of 105 basis point range it's been running at. Can you give an update on how we should think about that going forward? Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit : Ryan, this is Steve. We've long encouraged people to think in terms of 100 basis points as being the longer-term run rate of ROA for the annuities business. The recent change in this quarter reflected a couple of things. First of all, it reflected some one-time expenses, and it also reflected something of a shift in our product mix gradually over time towards the PDI product, which is lower risk but also on a marginal basis lower fees as well. So given all of that, we'd still encourage people to think very much in terms of 100 bps as the ROA for the annuities business. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Great, thanks. And then do you just have an update on the fair value of the yen capital hedge? Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Ryan, it's Rob. Yeah, so we've \u2013 the hedge at the end of the first quarter was a negative $520 million. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. And then does that \u2013 would you expect that to have an impact on \u2013 I guess if things stay unchanged, should we think of that as having any impact on free cash flow generation over time as it gets realized? Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, let me sort of step back. First, if you sort of bring it up a level, Ryan, the hedge was actually doing exactly what it was designed to do. It's protecting our ROE regardless of the direction of the yen. Our (30:34) settlements in the program have actually been sufficient to complete the offset any depreciation that's occurred in the yen to its current level. And recall that we actually started this program back when the yen was at 77. Specifically, to your question, we have had periods in the past where the hedges worked in the other direction and cash would be flowing back to the international businesses as those settled. They are staged over time, and so they settle over periods of time. They've been orchestrated in a way such that the improved earnings on a yen basis \u2013 or the yen earnings that we have in Japan on a dollar basis are going up as a result of that appreciation in the yen, and therefore, the dividends that we're getting out of that business will offset over time the cash that goes on the settlement of the hedges. So we sort of think of it as, there could be on a year-to-year or quarter-to-quarter basis a little bit of cash mismatch, but overall, these things will settle out. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And next we're going to the line of Nigel Dally. Please go ahead. Morgan Stanley. Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Good morning. So, Mark, you mentioned that you've reduced the interest rate assumptions as part of the actuarial review. Could you elaborate on that? How much was it changed and what was it changed to? And also, did you recalibrate the separate account return assumptions? Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, Nigel, it's Rob. Actually, I'll jump in on this. The \u2013 we took the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year down from 4.25% to 4%. In Japan, we took the similar 10-year benchmark down from 2% down to 1.9%. The impact of that, if you think about the returns expected from the variable annuity accounts, which I think is what you're asking, is that the return over the what we call the near- to intermediate term, so call it the next 0 to 10 years, averages about 4.8%. And then after 10 years, as a result of migrating up to those reversion rates that I mentioned, it's about 6.5% Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. Then just on the buybacks, are the higher plans purely a reflection of the capital release from this VA restructuring that you completed, or does the restructure also improve the free cash flow which could possibly impact the pace of future buybacks? Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So the immediate increase in the buyback is tied to the $1 billion that came up as a result of the recapture initiative that we have underway in our variable annuities business. But to the point that you've made, I would emphasize that while we'll continue to evaluate our buybacks and are not forecasting anything in the way of an increase at this point. We are encouraged by the increased cash flow profile that comes out of our annuities business. It's really driven by two things, Nigel. First is the fact that as this block matures, the sales relative to the existing block lead it to throw off more cash. The second is this construct that we've put in place. It is a more stable long-term contract, subject to less volatility, and therefore gives us more degrees of freedom in terms of how we think about taking the cash out of the annuities business as earnings are generated annually. Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And next we're going to the line of Jimmy Bhullar. Please go ahead. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. The first question is just on your \u2013 just following-up on the rate assumption. I just wanted to make sure I got the numbers right. So you took the rate assumption down to 4%, or was it down to 2% from 4%? Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So the U.S. rate 10-year benchmark, Jimmy, was brought from 4.25% down to 4%. The JGB 10-year benchmark was brought from 2% down to 1.9%. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : But considering current rates, those still seem relatively high level, so just wondering what the justification was for not reducing them further? And maybe if you could give us any sort of sensitivity to what the impact would have been to your results had you brought it down by another 50 basis points or 100 basis points in each market? Or is it 50 basis points in Japan, 100 basis points in the U.S.? Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. So a couple of thoughts. First, Jimmy, with respect to the process that we go through, understand it is a well-established and well-controlled actuarial review process that we undertake and come up with these rates. We look at historical rates, we look at forward rates, we survey both internal and external experts to get their views of rates on a go-forward basis. And we use a central estimate that's derived from looking at all of those data points. So that's consistent with what we've done in the past, and we continue to apply on a go-forward basis. With respect to the interest rate sensitivity, if you look at our assumption updates, what I would tell you is that they were not materially affected by the decline in that long-term reversion rate. We had some interest rate impact; not particularly material. Most of it was driven by the current level of interest rates as opposed to a change in that long-term assumption. Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman : Yeah, that's important. Remember that we grade up to the long-term assumption but current rates are in the books. Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And it takes about a 10-year period of time for that grade up, so we start at current levels and then follow the forward curve for a couple of years and then do a linear grade up to that long-term reversion rate by year 10. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman : Yeah, so today's very low rates are in our balance sheet. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Basically, you're following the forward curve for maybe the next year, two years but then you're assuming a relatively steep increase to get to that 4%, right? Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You can do the math; it's a linear extrapolation from third year on to year 10. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And secondly just in Japan, what's your view of the bank channel in Japan? It's about I think close to 20% of your sales. Several companies have been pulling back from the channel, especially with the further drop in rates? So maybe if you could talk about your long-term view of that channel and profitability of the business that you're selling through the channel? Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit : Sure. Let me take a little bit of a step back and talk about our position with regard to the bank channel. So we believe that we have a differentiated strategy within the bank channel. When we first acquired Star/Edison there were about 100 bank partners in total. And consistent with what we've done both in both independent agency and the LC channels, we reduced the number of relationships focusing on the quality of products, the service and the fit with the bank partners that we've chose to do business with. So we reduced that to about 60 bank partners that currently offer our products and we sell through about 80% of those bank partners in any given quarter. But there are three points of differentiation that really affect our profitability in the bank channel. The first is that we provide exceptional service to our banking partners. We have about 240 secondees. Those are life planners that we've seconded to the banks and they provide exceptional service to the bank clients. So we don't have to be the lowest price. We compete on service; we don't compete via spreadsheets. The second is that we focus on death protection. The majority of our sales include mortality and expense margins, obviously. And the other point here is that we have a very high proportion of recurring premium in current products as opposed to just savings products. So over 80% of our sales in banks are recurring premiums and that's something we've been working really hard on and have changed the banks mentality, at least our partners' mentality, toward the kind of products that are sold. And the third is that the relatively little single premium fixed annuity products that we do sell through the channel are re-priced twice a month for new business and they all have market value adjustment or MVA features. And now we really sell only U.S. dollar products, because we've been making that shift that John and Mark talked about. So we feel very good about the differentiated strategy we employ, the mix of products we sell and the resultant profitability of the business. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next we'll go to the line of Mike Kovac, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Mike Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks for taking the question. We've seen a couple of other life companies in the U.S. provide some increased disclosure on a lower for longer scenario in terms of the impact on both the life and annuity blocks. I'm wondering if you can give us an update in terms of how you see it impacting the balance sheet if we were in say, 1% for a prolonged of time? Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, Mike, it's Rob. Let me try to take a crack at that. First, it's important to point out that we've had a significant reduction in our interest rate sensitivity, post the completion of the VA captive initiative. You've seen that in both the first quarter and the second quarter, driven by the fact that, as I indicated earlier, we've migrated over to a more stable statutory framework and it reflects the long-term nature of the risks. Importantly we eliminated the internal corporate hedge, under hedge, excuse me, as I indicated in my opening comments. And we're managing all of the VA risks within those same legal entities. I'd also note that we manage our balance sheet so that we can maintain our AA targets through cyclical stress scenarios. So that includes 100 basis point further decline in interest rates from where we are today. So from a balance sheet standpoint, we would not expect to have any degradation in our credit quality as a result of a sustained low rate of a significant quantum from where we are today. Mike Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So do you have a sense or can you provide us a sense of \u2013 I know this was part of an answer to an earlier question \u2013 in terms of taking the long-term interest rate assumption down by 25 basis points. I believe you mentioned it wasn't that material. But can you give us a sense of the scale of what that sort of immaterial means? Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, in terms of the first 25 down, it was not material so I don't have the numbers to put around it because it wasn't something that rises to a level where we thought it was important to provide a disclosure. With regard to an additional 25 basis points, we have not done the calculation in terms of what the \u2013 if you run that through all the assumption updates with another 25 basis points down, I'd go back to the comment that I made about a capital position which is that we've run stress scenarios significantly more severe than that and are comfortable that we're holding capital on a basis that would allow us to continue to maintain our AA rating and write business. Mike Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks. And then maybe one for John here on regulation. Appreciate the comments and the statement that the rules still have a ways to go until they get to the finish line. Any sort of early thoughts in terms of strategy, either an impact on the overall bond portfolio shifts now to Closed Block will be managed given the commentary we saw come out from that side earlier in the year? Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman : No. This is Mark. That's very much still work in process and we're not ready to talk about or take any actions in anticipation of what comes out. I think the main message around the work on capital standards is that all of the signals are clearly consistent with the right approach to insurance. Mike Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks for the answers. Operator : Thank you. And next we're going to the line of Seth Weiss, Bank of America. Please go ahead. Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah, hi. Good morning. Just a question on the VA recapture. Last quarter I think you mentioned that there were still some steps around ALM that needed to be completed throughout the remainder of the year. Is what you announced today basically finish those steps and put to bed any other remaining actions on the VA recapture? Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So it's Rob, Seth. As of August 1, the recapture initiative was substantially completed. There is obviously fine tuning of both accounting and ALM as we proceed forward in order to optimize the structure that we have in place. But yes, we are completed as of August 1. Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. And all around it seems like the recapture was a homerun; it reduces the volatility and increased the capacity by about $1 billion. I think if we go back to the fourth quarter last year, you commented that you were really able to make this change because of the updated regulatory environment allowing this discussion with the regulator. Was that the only thing that prevented you from doing this in the past, or are there any cost consequences that we should consider about? I guess I'm just wondering why it wasn't done in the past and want to make sure we're thinking about any kind of knock-on effects going forward. Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : The reason we set up the captive to begin with wasn't driven by a desire to manage capital down or otherwise optimize the way we're managing capital but rather in order to optimize the way in which we were managing the risk. And the way in which the statutory construct worked in the past was such that \u2013 the primary shortcoming of it was such that the use of derivatives which we thought was important to manage this risk was not fully incorporated or adequately incorporated into that construct. And where the statutory construct is migrating toward is one which gives a much fuller and robust recognition of derivatives, both their use, their mission, modeling of the derivatives and the accounting for the derivatives. And that was really the primary reason why we went to captive and the motivation for being able to recapture from the captive. There are economic benefits in the recapture that I've described before that led to, as you know, to the reduced volatility and the free up of capital. So all things being equal, we'd rather manage this thing holistically. It was the shortcomings of the construct before that prevented us from doing so. Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman : Yeah, I think maybe just to emphasize part of what you might be asking. Because we never used the captive to arbitrage either reserves or admitted assets or capital, we didn't go into the recapture in a hole. We actually, as you see, went into the recapture from a position of strength. So there are things out there that would have been an advantage in the captive structure that we're going to lose as a result of the recapture. Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And next we're going to the line of Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. I actually have a follow-up on Seth's line of questions. I just want to make sure that I understand the impact or the mechanics of the recapture here. So ultimately, does it mean that you have added to the hedging this variable annuity hedging, or is it just that the accounting for the same hedges is now different? Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yaron, the GAAP accounting has not changed, just to be clear on that. What has changed is we've taken business that resided in five different legal entities and consolidated it down to two and substantially just in one. We have a New York and non-New York set of entities. All of the risks of the business are now being managed within those two statutory entities and we're managing them through a combination of derivatives and on-balance-sheet financial assets. Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And why would that new construct ultimately lead to a meaningful reduction in capital volatility and to the increased stability and cash flow uncertainty? Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, think about it this way, as I had mentioned before, we hold to CTE 97, and we do so including under modeled stress scenarios. When you're doing that calculation in five different entities, now imagine doing that consolidated across a single entity largely or the two entities. You get efficiencies, as you might expect, both in the reduction in risks that result in the offsetting of risks that go in different directions from the writer than they do the host contract. And you get efficiencies associated with the capital management because you don't have the friction of having to move capital and hedges between the different legal entities. So both from a capital standpoint in terms of how the calculation works and then from our ability to then manage the risk and then you lay on top of that the statutory construct being one that is more stable, less volatile, all three of those combine to the reduced volatility that you're seeing and will see going forward and the free-up of the capital. Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman : Yeah, maybe a big-picture way to think about it is that the profitability of the host contract mitigates the risk of the living benefit standalone, and when the living benefit guarantee was in a standalone entity we had to manage all the volatility that went with it. But when it's combined with the host, there are substantial positive cash flows and very stable cash flows from the host contract Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. That's very helpful. I appreciate the color. Operator : Thank you. And next we're going to the line of Randy Binner from FBR. Please go ahead. Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Yeah, I also have a question on the recapture, sorry to belabor this. But my impression at one point was that while everything you've said about the recapture is true and I think, as Seth and Yaron said, it was a home run. But doesn't it create a reporting or an accounting potential for volatility in tail scenarios now that you've moved from that modified GAAP to the statutory accounting now? If I'm wrong, please explain why. I thought the catch in this was that it might not report as well under tail scenarios under this construct versus the old one? Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, Randy, very clearly there can be noneconomic volatility in GAAP outcomes. We've seen that in the past and we expect we'll continue to see that. If you look at our results, however, a large portion of this was due to the, quote, \"corporate under-hedge\" of the interest rate risk, which has now been eliminated. There is a residual misalignment between statutory and economic view of the liability and how it gets expressed in GAAP. You saw that in what we called the risk margin, which was the delta between the GAAP liability and the hedge target before. And you will continue to see that volatility between the full GAAP liability and our economic target of that liability, so that has not gone away for us. Having said that, we expect to manage the outcome in a way that helps to mitigate that reported volatility going forward. The other thing I think is important to highlight is that, as I mentioned earlier, the annuities business going forward we think in addition to the stability coming out of it is going to be a source of strong cash flow for the two reasons that I highlighted. And so the wins associated with this construct far outweigh what we view to be the potential for GAAP volatility, which frankly, we've been dealing with for our historical period already. Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: So basically, for all intents and purposes, you're saying that whatever that GAAP volatility is that's non-economic, really, it won't change that much in the structure versus what you had before? Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think that's fair to say. Our expectation is, relative to interest rates we'll have less GAAP volatility than we had before, and our volatility in response to equity market movements will be roughly what it was before. Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And next we're going to the line of Eric Berg, RBC Capital. Please go ahead. Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks very much. With respect to the interest rate that you have now lowered \u2013 your long-term interest rate assumptions that you've lowered. Are we referencing here the rates for the appreciation in the separate accounts or are we talking about discount rates that is used to discount the cash flows underlying the liability calculation? Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So this is the \u2013 Randy, it's Rob. This is the - Alan Mark Finkelstein - Senior Vice President & Head- Investor Relations : Eric. Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Oh I'm sorry. Eric. Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : No problem. No problem at all. Go right ahead. Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Eric, it's Rob. I'm on the last question. That is the long-term rate that's used in our actuarial assumptions as they affect the different liabilities that we have on our balance sheet, so that includes the account values and the rate at which they grow, but it also includes the host of other liabilities that we have for which we have to do actuarial computations. Mark B. Grier - Vice Chairman : It's not just the variable annuity piece. Robert M. Falzon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Right. Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Right. And maybe, John, you could address it \u2013 and my second and final question relates to the Asset Management business in general. As is widely known, it has proven to be a historic year in a negative sense for the asset management industry. It looks like we're on track to have a record amount of equity outflows from equity funds in North America. What is Prudential's strategy? You've talked now for two quarters about outflows in equities. What is your strategy for Asset Management given this very challenging context? John Robert Strangfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Eric, so let me take a couple of minutes on how we think about Asset Management because I think our view on this reflects both the uniqueness of our approach and our circumstances. So for us, Asset Management is a hybrid business model, one that we're very proud of, one that works well for our clients and ourselves. By that what I mean is, it's not a holding in which we have a passive ownership stake as some do and nor is it a department that's serving one client. What it is is a business and has a capability with critical interconnectivity to Prudential and its strategies. And its market-facing strength enables us to attract and retain topflight investment talent which in turn produces consistent investment results that are very favorable. At this point it's got over $1 trillion in AUM and as we commented today, it's over $0.5 trillion of third-party unaffiliated assets. And actually in terms of Asset Management fees, roughly 80% of them are derived from managing third-party assets. So it's a very significant third-party asset manager and business but it does exceedingly well. I think last year's flows were around $20 billion. Keep in mind we have more fixed income assets than we have equities, so we sort of benefit from that pace of the cycle. But it's also a major contributor as well as beneficiary of its interrelationship with other parts of PRU. And you see that manifest within a lot of ways which in turn enables us to be more competitive and gives us an edge in various areas whether it's PRT and the role asset management plays there or whether it's the role it plays in investing assets on behalf of our activities in Japan or the role the private placements and mortgages play to our various activities in our spread-related activities. So to us it's very distinctive in relation to others. It's not a holding in which we have a passive stake. It's not a department. It's a hybrid and it's doing very, very well. It's doing very well in part because of the consistency of our investment performance and the consistency and the stability and the quality of our investment professionals as well. Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit : Eric, it's Steve. Let me take the strategic points that John mentioned and make them a bit more granular. You referenced equity outflows in the industry and we've seen that as well. In our case it's very much the shift from active to passive that is driving that. That's particularly visible in our traditional U.S. style box strategies. I want to point out however that those strategies only represent about 10% to 15% of the total PGIM to AUM. Nonetheless we're addressing that on two levels. First within the equities business itself. We're continuing to invest in growth in areas that have shown relatively greater resilience in the active to passive trend. Among those I would count global, international, income-oriented and the factor-based enhanced indexing that we do in our quantitative management business. So we're maintaining that commitment to alpha generation but diversifying our approach to how we make that happen. Second, and perhaps even more significant, the basic nature of our multi-manager structure provides sustainability and strength. We've seen equity outflows, as you mentioned, but we've also seen robust inflows in fixed income and real estate and strong origination levels in privates and mortgages. That multi-manager structure has been one of the principal drivers of 13 straight years of positive third-party institutional net flows and it continues to give us confidence in our prospects going forward. Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thanks both of you. Alan Mark Finkelstein - Senior Vice President & Head- Investor Relations : Don, we'll take one more question, please. Operator : Thank you. Next we'll go to the line of Suneet Kamath, UBS. Please go ahead. Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to start with the annuities business. I guess we've kind of been in breakeven flows now for several quarters. And given its one of your largest earnings contributors, I'm trying to get a sense of, do you have some initiatives in place around product innovation, et cetera, that can start to turn the flows positive at some point over the next several quarters? Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit : Suneet, this is Steve. First of all, we very much want to make sure at all times in the annuities business, that we're operating it on a sustainable basis. So while obviously we seek to be competitive, we also want to make sure that we're maintaining a pricing discipline. In PDI for example, we recently announced a 25 basis point decrease in both the rollup rate and the payout rate and we think that's appropriate under the circumstance. But I'd say that we look at this, Suneet, on both a tactical and a strategic level. First of all, on a tactical level, we'll continue to make the adjustments necessary, as I say, to make sure we're tailoring our product design and pricing it on a sustainable basis. But on a more strategic basis, I think it's going to be very much a story of product diversification, including getting more and more into areas of streamlined and simplified product design. I think our recent track record on how we've managed product in the annuities business and how we've managed our diversification strategy gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to continue this. We've taken PDI from a standing start basically from launch two years ago, only two years ago, to now representing over half of our sales in this quarter; half of our sales even before you account for HDI reinsurance. So that type of success and diversification up to this point gives us, as I say, a lot of confidence in believing that we can take that further in product design along the lines that I mentioned. Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And then just a little while ago, Lincoln talked about on its call, moving to more passive options within the VA, presumably to lower cost to the consumer. Is that something that you guys are looking at as well? Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit : I think there will be a lot of different elements where we're looking to, as I say to have a streamlined and simplified product design and some that may be lower cost as well. In a sense, PDI represents already a step in that regard but we'll continue that path. Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And then just one quick one for Rob. You may have covered this before, so I apologize, but on the Life Insurance charge and the change in accounting interpretation that was referenced earlier, is there any ongoing impact to earnings that we should expect from that change, or is it purely a one-time phenomenon? Stephen P. Pelletier - Executive Vice President & COO-US Business Unit : It is a one-time charge, however, recall that the way it works in any business, the present value of a number that we have to accrete to over time, some 15 plus years out. And so therefore, there is an ongoing impact as you establish a number that on a PV basis now needs to grow to that future value. So our belief is net of all our assumption updates that'll get washed out. But on an isolated basis it has a small, modest drag going forward. Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC : All right. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 1 :30 p.m. today through 11 :59 p.m. August 11, 2016.

John, I'll hand it over to you. John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Overall, we delivered solid earnings for the third quarter and we continue to see momentum across our domestic and international businesses. We benefit from a differentiated set of high-quality businesses that fit well together. The balance of our businesses and risks enables us to produce strong overall earnings and also helps weather the normal variability that can occur across segments in any given quarter. Operating earnings per share for the quarter of $2.51 excluding market-driven and discrete items was consistent with our internal expectations and the $2.52 that we produced in the third quarter of 2015. Our annualized return on equity through nine months was healthy at about 13%. And book value per share excluding AOCI and foreign currency re-measurement grew 9% over the prior year. While our overall results were solid and we saw good core growth across many of our businesses, there were a number of factors that influenced the quarter. On the positive side, we reported strong investment results, benefiting from non-coupon investment returns that exceeded our average expectations. While results in this asset class do show variability, we are pleased to see the bounce back in returns following weaker results in the first half of the year. Our annuities business also benefited from a more efficient approach to managing risk, that positively impacted margins, which should have an element of sustainability going forward. On the other hand, our overall underwriting experience was less favorable than our average expectations and this can fluctuate on a quarterly basis. In addition, expenses were elevated in the quarter. Mark will discuss this in more detail, but we experienced a higher than usual level of charges and expenses of items that are inherently variable. I'll now make some high-level observations on the fundamentals in our businesses, starting with our international operations. We reported solid core growth and favorable underwriting margins at our Life Planner and Gibraltar businesses. Foreign-exchange and higher than typical expenses adversely impacted earnings comparisons to the prior year, but otherwise the segment produced steady mid-single-digit core growth. Constant currency sales increased 8% over the third quarter of 2015, driven by a significant increase in U.S. dollar sales in Japan. While interest rates remain a significant challenge in Japan, we are pleased with the pricing and product actions that we have taken on yen products. And the current quarter results continue to show the benefit of our well-established distribution strength including for U.S. dollar products. Our U.S. businesses also produced overall good results, though with some moving parts. At PGIM, our asset management business, we are pleased with the growth in our core earnings and assets under management. We reported another strong quarter for net flows, which contributed to PGIM $1.1 trillion of total AUM at September 30, including over $500 billion with unaffiliated institutional and retail third-party accounts. And notably, we believe we are also starting to see the payback on our initiative spending in PGIM with over $15 billion of net flows since the beginning of 2015 that are directly tied to recent strategic initiatives. Our retirement business also had another good quarter, generating solid earnings and showing positive growth trends. Strong net flows in the quarter were mainly driven by our pension risk transfer business, which closed on several transactions including one notable sale in the quarter of $2.5 billion. Although transaction activity in the PRT business is lumpy, this remains a highly attractive business in an area where we are clear industry leader. Earnings and margins in our Individual Annuities business were very good. However, we continue to see some sales pressures. There are distribution uncertainties associated with the Department of Labor regulations and the low interest rate environment influences product attractiveness. That said, our product diversification efforts have enabled us to mitigate downward sales pressures and improve our risk profile. In addition, actions we have taken to manage our annuity risk more efficiently enhance our confidence that Individual Annuities will represent a strong source of earnings and cash flows with lower volatility and greater transparency going forward. Our U.S. protection results were mixed. Group Insurance continues to produce very good underwriting margins with a benefit ratio in the quarter at the low end of our expected range. However, Individual Life insurance reported results well below our expectations due to adverse mortality and higher than typical charges. While we were disappointed by these results for the quarter and for the first nine months, claim experience can fluctuate over the shorter time frames, and our overall mortality experience has been positive in aggregate over the last several years. I will now make some quick observations on capital deployment and regulation. We returned about $930 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases. Balancing capital deployment between shareholder return and strategic initiatives while maintaining a strong capital position remains a key priority. Share repurchases in the quarter as well as our remaining authorization for 2016 include amounts related to the capital that was freed up from our variable annuity restructuring. Nonetheless, we continue to expect about 60% of our earnings over time to be available for shareholder returns and other accretive actions. And on the regulatory front, we recently issued comment letters to the Fed Reserve in response to proposals for capital requirements as well as for corporate governance, risk management and liquidity standards. This continues to be an iterative process with a long way to go, but we remain encouraged by the efforts of the Fed to put into place an appropriate set of standards for insurance entities. In conclusion, we remain positive on our prospects and ability to generate differentiated returns and strong cash flows in an evolving and challenging environment. We continue to invest in our businesses with initiatives that have both shorter and longer term payback periods. A good portion of these expenses are financed through efficiency gains that we've been able to achieve across our operations. But ultimately, our investments in products, distribution and technology including how we engage with customers will enable us to continue to succeed and capitalize on growth opportunities over the long time frames. And with that, I'll hand it over to Mark. Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thanks, John. Good morning, good afternoon or good evening. Thank you for joining our call today. Special thanks to those of you in Chicago who are participating in our earlier than usual call this morning. I'll take you through our results and then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon, who will cover liquidity, leverage and capital highlights, and I'll start on slide 2. After-tax adjusted operating income amounted to $2.66 per share for the quarter compared to $2.40 a year ago. Core performance of our businesses remained solid in the quarter, with results benefiting from higher fees in our asset management and annuities businesses and continued business growth and International Insurance on a constant currency basis. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, earnings-per-share was essentially flat compared to a year ago, as the year-over-year comparison was affected by fluctuations and a few inherently variable items. I'll mention a few highlights. First, higher current quarter net expenses within our Corporate and Other results and in several businesses, largely driven by higher than typical charges for items such as employee benefit and compensation plans and legal costs. Second, less favorable underwriting experience compared to a contribution more favorable than our average expectations a year ago. And third, more favorable net investment results with current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees above our average expectation. The items I mentioned together with less favorable currency exchange rates had a negative impact of roughly $0.30 per share on the comparison of our results to a year ago. The net impact of current quarter variances in comparison to our average expectation contributed about $0.05 per-share to earnings related to favorable non-coupon investment income, prepayment fees and net adverse claims experience across businesses together with reserve refinements and higher than typical legal costs in Individual Life. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, our EPS of $7.22 for the first nine months of 2016 implies an annualized ROE of just under 13%. In thinking about our earnings pattern, I would note that in recent years, a number of our businesses have had higher than average expenses in the fourth quarter, including the seasonal impact of items such as annual policyholder communications and on-boarding as well as business development, advertising and other variable costs. Looking back over the past three years, this pattern has produced on average about $125 million to $175 million higher expenses in the fourth quarter than the average quarterly level for the full year. On a GAAP basis, including amounts categorized as realized investment gains or losses and results from divested businesses, we reported net income of $1.8 billion for the current quarter, about $600 million above our after-tax adjusted operating income. This difference was mainly driven by favorable results from product derivatives and hedging. Turning now to slide 3. Market-driven and discrete items for the quarter include a benefit from our quarterly market and experience unlocking in the annuities business, driven mainly by performance of equities in customer accounts and also include a charge for legal costs in retirement driven by cases we believe are approaching conclusion. Moving to side four. Our GAAP net income of $1.8 billion in the current quarter includes amounts characterized as pre-tax net realized investment gains of $649 million and divested business results and other items outside of adjusted operating income amounting to net pre-tax gains of $125 million. Of note, product-related embedded derivatives and hedging had a positive impact of $553 million, mainly driven by GAAP-embedded derivatives and related items for annuities living benefits. Impairments and credit losses of $40 million were the lowest of the past five quarters. The gain from general portfolio activities came mainly from our international operations and is largely driven by currency-related gains. The current quarter income from divested businesses mainly reflects results from long-term care and the Closed Block. Moving to our business results and starting on slide 5. I'll discuss the comparative results excluding the market-driven and discrete items that I mentioned. Annuities earnings were $449 million for the quarter, up by $35 million from a year ago. The increase was mainly driven by more favorable net investment results, including current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees about $10 million above our average expectations, as well as favorable true up. In addition, results benefited from a greater net contribution from policy charges and fees due to the refinements we've recently implemented in our risk management strategy for product guarantees as well as higher account values. We estimate that our changes in risk management strategy contributed just under 5 points to return on assets, or ROA, for the quarter, with a little over 5 additional points from favorable investment returns relative to average expectations and from the true up in the quarter. Keep in mind that quarterly ROA can vary from a baseline, and results for this quarter were stronger than what we would expect as a base case. Slide 6 presents our annuity sales. While total sales are essentially unchanged from a year ago, you can see the impact of our diversification strategy in the current quarter mix. Nearly three quarters of annuity sales comes without retained exposure to equity market-linked living benefit guarantees. Sales of our fixed income-based PDI product were $1 billion in the quarter, reflecting strong market demand along with our successful diversification efforts. The $400 million increase in PDI sales from a year ago offset lower sales of our Highest Daily, or HD, product. Turning to slide 7. Retirement earnings were $273 million for the quarter, up by $51 million from a year ago. The increase reflects a $75 million greater contribution from net investment results, including current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees about $55 million above our average expectations. This compares to non-coupon investment returns about $10 million below our average expectations a year ago. A lower contribution from case experience, which was about $20 million less favorable than our average expectations in the current quarter, including reserve strengthening in a legacy case, was a partial offset. I would note that the pattern of case experience can fluctuate from one quarter to another, and we've benefited from about $100 million of favorable case experience since the beginning of 2015. Turning to slide 8. Total retirement gross deposits and sales were $12.3 billion for the current quarter compared to $11.5 billion a year ago, which included a $4.7 billion major case win in full-service. Gross sales of institutional investment products in the current quarter amounted to about $7 billion, with roughly $4 billion of new pension risk transfer cases, including about $3 billion of funded business and $1 billion of longevity reinsurance. In addition, stable value wraps contributed about $2 billion to current quarter sales. Net flows for the quarter were positive, both in full-service and institutional investment products, totaling about $5 billion. Turning to slide 9. Asset management earnings were $191 million for the quarter compared to $180 million a year ago. The increase was driven by higher asset management fees partly offset by higher net expenses in the current quarter and a $6 million lower contribution from other related revenues. The increase in asset management fees reflected greater fees from management of fixed income assets driven by growth in assets under management and the benefit of a fee rate restructuring in real estate partly offset by lower fees tied to equities. The asset management business reported $4.3 billion of net positive unaffiliated third-party flows in the quarter, excluding money market activity, with contributions from institutional and retail business each driven by fixed income flows. Turning to slide 10. Individual Life earnings were $111 million for the quarter, down $72 million from a year ago. The decrease in earnings came mainly from a negative fluctuation in claims experience, with a current quarter contribution to earnings about $30 million below our average expectations, including a negative impact of about $10 million from related reserve updates and amortization. This compares to a strong year-ago quarter, when the contribution to earnings from claims experience was about $25 million more favorable than average expectations. In addition, current quarter results included a negative impact of about $20 million from reserve refinements and higher-than-typical legal costs. These items were partly offset by a greater contribution from net investment results, including current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees of about $10 million more favorable than our average expectations. Turning to slide 11. Individual Life sales based on annualized new business premiums were down $15 million from a year ago. The decrease came mainly from variable life, where sales tend to be driven by large cases and are lumpy. In addition, guaranteed universal life sales were down from a year ago, reflecting the impact of price increases earlier this year. We recently announced further price increases and face amount limits with these products to help maintain appropriate returns and meet our targets for new business diversification. Turning to slide 12. Group Insurance earnings were $62 million for the quarter, up $18 million from a year ago. The increase came mainly from a greater contribution from net investment results, including current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, about $10 million more favorable than our average expectations. More favorable underwriting results also contributed to the increase. The current quarter total benefits ratio was at the favorable end of our targeted range of 87% to 91%. Moving to International Insurance and turning to slide 13. Earnings for our Life Planner business were $391 million for the quarter compared to $398 million a year ago. Excluding a $23 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, earnings increased by $16 million from a year ago. Current quarter results benefited from continued business growth, more favorable surrender experience and a greater contribution from net investment results, including earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees which were slightly above our average expectation. Less favorable claims experience and higher expenses were partial offsets. While the current quarter contribution to results from claims experience was below the level of a year ago, it was about $10 million more favorable than our average expectations. Turning to slide 14. Gibraltar Life earnings were $389 million for the quarter compared to $414 million a year ago. Excluding the negative impact of $30 million on the comparison from foreign currency exchange rates, earnings are essentially unchanged from a year ago. Current quarter results benefited from business growth, including the contribution from our investment in AFP Habitat in Chile. We also had more favorable claims experience, with a contribution to earnings about $10 million more favorable than our average expectations. These benefits were largely offset by about $25 million of higher expenses, driven largely by nonlinear items including employee benefit plan true-ups and office move costs in the current quarter. The current quarter contribution to earnings from net investment results was largely in line with a year ago and included returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, slightly less favorable than our average expectations. Before leaving international results, I will note that we have completed the hedging of our expected yen earnings for 2017, and our hedging rate for next year will be 112 yen per U.S. dollar. Turning to slide 15. International Insurance sales on a constant dollar basis were $771 million for the current quarter, up by $55 million or 8% from a year ago. This sales growth was driven by a 63% increase in our sales of U.S. dollar products in Japan, which more than offset lower yen-based sales. U.S. dollar products comprise nearly 60% of our current quarter sales in Japan compared to about 40% of sales a year ago. This change in mix reflects the enhanced attractiveness of our U.S. dollar products to Japanese consumers in the current environment and also reflects actions we've taken for yen products that are most affected by interest rates, including reductions in crediting rates and commissions and in some cases, stale suspensions. These are generally products with the greatest cash value accumulation features, including certain single premium products. While we are seeing competitors in Japan expand their efforts to sell U.S. dollar products in response to low and negative interest rates on yen-based investment, we continue to benefit from solid competitive advantages in the distribution of these products and our long-standing focus on recurring premium debt protection policies with returns largely driven by mortality and expense margins. Life Planner sales in Japan were up 15% from a year ago, reflecting a 9% increase in agent count driven mainly by recent sales manager appointments together with higher productivity and average premium size. Gibraltar sales were up 6% from a year ago. This reflected a 13% sales increase from our life consultants driven by mainly by higher average premium size together with an increase in agent count. Third-party channel sales were roughly in line with a year ago. Sales outside Japan are up 4% from a year ago, driven by continued growth in Brazil. Turning to slide 16, the Corporate and Other loss was $413 million for the current quarter compared to a $308 million loss a year ago. Corporate and Other results include a number of items that are inherently variable. Net expenses were about $90 million above the year-ago quarter with the majority of the increase driven by employee benefit and compensation plans with obligations that are mostly re-measured each quarter based on equity markets or share prices. The current quarter increases in Prudential's stock and in the broader S&P 500 compared to meaningful declines a year ago contributed to a significant change in the impact of these plans on results. Higher current quarter costs for item such as business development and consulting and a $20 million benefit to the year-ago quarter from a reinsurance settlement also contributed to the year-over-year increase. Now I'll turn it over Rob. Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. I'm going to provide an update on key balance sheet items, financial measures and other related areas of interest starting on slide 17. Following the recapture of living benefit risks from our reinsurance captive earlier this year, most of the economics and risks of our variable annuity contracts and the supporting capital are now resident in a single statutory entity we call PALAC, which was a direct writer of many of the contracts. As a result, we now view composite RBC including our U.S. insurance entities on a comprehensive basis as a primary measure of our financial strength in relation to our benchmarks. On that basis, composite RBC at year-end 2015 was 486%, and we estimate that it is well above our 400% target at the end of the third quarter. In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margins of 840% and 987%, respectively, as of June 30. These solvency margins are comfortably above our targets. I'll turn now to an update on the risk management refinements we implemented during the third quarter as part of the strategy to manage all our annuities product risks together within the annuities business. We continue to manage these risks on an economic basis, including the ability to maintain a CTE 97 threshold through moderate stress scenarios. With the current structure, we are now managing the risks with a combination of traditional fixed income investments and derivatives held within our statutory entities. These strategy refinements are beginning to produce earnings benefits, as Mark mentioned, and are simplifying our annuities operation, reducing our capital volatility and increasing the certainty of cash flows from the business. Looking at the liquidity, leverage and capital deployment highlights on slide 18. Cash and liquid assets at the parent company amounted to $3.5 billion at the end of the quarter, a decrease of about $500 million from June 30. This reflects the impact of the return of about $930 million to shareholders, including dividends and $625 million of share repurchases net of cash inflows during the quarter. Our financial and total leverage ratios at September 30 remained within our targets. As we mentioned in our second quarter earnings call, we expect to move the evaluation of our dividend level to the first quarter of 2017 in order to get better aligned with our capital planning cycle. And with that, I'll turn it back over to John. John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thank you, Rob. Thank you, Mark. We'd like to open it up. Operator : Thank you very much. Our first question will come from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. I had a couple of questions. First, if you could discuss the earnings benefit that you're talking about in the annuity business as a result of the captive recapture. What's really driving that? And to what extent can you quantify the ongoing benefit? And then secondly, you mentioned case experience being negative in parts of your retirement business. If you could give us a little bit more detail on which product line you've seen that in and how has the aggregate experience in that product line been over time. Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: So, Jimmy, it's Rob. I'll take the first of those questions, then I'll turn it over to Steve to take the second. And actually in talking about the annuities piece, it's a good story, so I'm going to actually spend a minute on it, if you don't mind. So recall that we completed this in three phases, the first at the end of last year where we got regulatory approval for the statutory framework that we were undertaking. The second phase completed in the second quarter, where we actually recaptured the living benefit rider. And then what you've seen in this quarter is that we migrated over to our new risk management strategy, and that strategy is what gave rise to the earnings enhancement that you asked about. The outcomes of those three phases have been that, first, we reorganized and simplified the legal entity structure that supports our annuities business. We're managing all the risks associated with that business within the annuities legal entities now, meaning that the internal corporate under hedge, which was a prior contributor to earnings capital and leverage volatility, is no longer in existence. And we're using a more stable statutory framework that reflects the long-term nature of the risks. And we've talked about that before. And as I noted in my remarks, we're using a combination of derivatives and financial assets to fully diffuse (30:34) that liability. The immediate results that you've seen have been a reduced capital sensitivity to market movements. You saw that particularly in the first and second quarters. A release of about $1 billion, which we talked about last quarter. That was the basis for the $0.5 billion increase in the share repurchases that were authorized, a portion of which we executed on during the course of this quarter. And those lower risks that gave rise to that release in capital are leading to lower costs actually than manage the risks. So that resulted in an increase in AOI, about $15 million in the quarter, but we think the run rate number is more like about $20 million. And it also incidentally gave rise to what you saw outside of AOI in the positive DAC unlocking that increased net income for the quarter as well. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And the $20 million is a quarterly number going forward? Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yes, it is, Jimmy. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Jimmy, it's Steve. I'll address the rest of your question. First of all, on annuities and the ROA. As Mark mentioned, 114 basis points is certainly driven in part by some favorable non-recurring items and some investment lift this quarter. However, the risk management strategy, as Rob just mentioned, it does create some sustainable run rate benefit. Mark mentioned it added about 4 basis points to 5 basis points. So while we'd still say that the average expectation for ROA in this business is between 100 basis points and 105 basis points, it would be fair to say that the new risk management strategy creates some degree of bias towards the upper part of that range. In regard to what you asked about, the retirement and the case experience. As Mark mentioned, that was adverse by about $20 million. However, half of that relates to reserve strengthening on a legacy block of business, GIC. If you look at the pension risk transfer business itself, case experience was very modestly below average expectations in this quarter. But the same cases that result in modest adverse experience this quarter have been cumulatively $100 million positive over the last seven quarters. So results are going to move around a little bit quarter to quarter, but all evidence continues to be that this is a very solid and very well-priced book of business. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from John Nadel with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Good morning, everybody. I guess the first one is I just wanted to discuss expenses. Mark, I appreciate your commentary that the fourth quarter tends to see some elevated levels, seasonally and otherwise. But it seems that 3Q results also exhibited some elevated expense levels. How should we think about the expense levels the first nine months of the year so that we can compare the average increase that we typically see in the fourth quarter? Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: So, John, it's Rob. John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, Rob. Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Let me start with the end question and then maybe I'll tack back to just some further reflections on that. From a seasonality standpoint, we think that the range that we've provided of, call it the $125 million to $175 million in the fourth quarter relative to the average of all four quarters is a trend that will persist. And so we expect to see that this year as well. You saw it in the fourth quarter of 2014. It was at the lower end of that range. And in the fourth quarter of 2015, it was the upper end of that range. Now we think about that against what we think of as sort of the adjusted level of expenses. And so in Mark's opening comments, he called out the $90 million of higher than what we would consider to be \u2013 or nonlinear elevated expenses relative to what we would consider to be more normal. About half that was in the businesses, and we called out some of the causes of that. The other half of it was in Corporate and Other, and we also identified the causes there. If you look the higher level of expenses and you look at our Corporate and Other, a lot of it is attributable to that. We're at an unusually high-level this quarter. And, so, if you kind of reflect on a more adjusted level for that, think about last quarter, we had one or two one-time charges that we adjusted for. We had an equity method of investment that we wrote down, and we had some costs associated with the tender offer we tendered for about $0.5 billion worth of debt. That brought that adjusted number down to $335 million last quarter. If you look at the trailing four quarters, so not quite the question you asked about sort of year to date. But if you look at this quarter and go back three, the average for those four quarters is around $350 million on an adjusted basis using what we've called out this quarter and last quarter. So I would think about that as sort as being indicative of a more normalized number, more \u2013 kind of a \u2013 more of an adjusted number that we would more typically see. And that gives you a sense for then what you would extrapolate against looking into the fourth quarter for measuring the variance against the first three. John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. That's all really helpful. I wanted to make sure that we should or shouldn't adjust for some of these items that you guys have called out. Okay. The second question, I know it's relatively small, but just added to your portfolio of businesses, and so I'm curious what your thoughts are with protest actions underway and the potential for some pretty significant reform around the Chilean pension system and how that maybe influences your view of AFP Habitat. Charles F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Sure. It's Charlie, John. There have been some continuing albeit smaller demonstrations in Chile around a couple of issues. There's a new issue involved as well. But the first issue revolves around the fact that people perceive their pensions to be low. And to solve this issue, Chile must go back to a defined benefit system. In other words, they'd like the government to fund higher pensions and to guarantee those pensions. So that's the first issue. The second issue that has arisen resolves around the push back on the investment structure used by a couple of foreign companies in their AFP purchases. So with regard to the first issue, the government has said they have no money to fund pensions, but they have suggested that corporations pay an additional 5% into the pension system. And President Bachelet has also suggested perhaps creating a government AFP in addition to the existing AFPs. So with regard to this issue, the situation remains fluid and probably will stay that way for some time as the government sorts out what they'll do. And we think that's going to be in the first half of next year. But there are some suggestions on the table, and we'll see what happens. In terms of Habitat, I'd like to make a couple of observations. First, it's the number two pension administrator with about a 26% market share. But we think that there are four key attributes of the company that are really important. First is that it focuses relentlessly on costs. In fact it's the most efficient AFP and has the lowest fee of any of the four largest players, and that's really important given the context of what's going on. Secondly, this has exceptional fund performance both on a relative and an absolute basis, and that's also really important as people focus on what they're getting for their investments. Third, they have very high quality service; and forth, they're a leading player in the voluntary pension products. In terms of the second issue, we acquired the company with a different structure than others, not amortizing any of the intangibles. And you may recall that it took an awfully long time to gain regulatory approval, in large part due to frankly, welcome scrutiny of our structure to make sure it met all the regulatory requirements. So from our point of view, we wanted to make sure that the agreement not only met the letter but the spirit of the law, and that's why we welcome the regulatory scrutiny in order to make sure that the regulators were very comfortable with the structure that we had. So we're monitoring the situation closely but feel as a company, Habitat is in a really good position within the industry. John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): That's really helpful. Thank you, Charlie. Operator : Thank you. Our next question in queue will be coming from Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. It seems like we started to see some pickup in pension risk transfer activity again. I was hoping for an update there. And I guess are plan sponsors starting to accept the low interest rate environment and kind of be more willing to transact again? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Ryan, it's Steve. Thanks for your question. The low rate environment status \u2013 the low rate environment does lower funding status in the aggregate. But as I've mentioned before \u2013 and your question reflects this. It's not so much about how rates are today but how rates are today in relation to where plan sponsors expect them to be in the future. And I think there is some degree of acceptance of lower rates for a longer period of time and then readiness to address pension risk. We still see a very robust pipeline. That pipeline is largely populated by plan sponsors who, over the past few years, have taken steps to mitigate their exposure to low rates through liability driven investing including in some cases, doing that LDI with us. So we still see a solid pipeline before us. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. And then the tax rate has trended down this year to about 23.5% year-to-date. Do you view that as a sustainable tax rate going forward? Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Ryan, it's Rob. Yes. Our estimate for our full-year effective tax rate for the year is right about that number, 23.5%. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI : Good morning. Hey, Rob, I had a question on RBC, considering the impact of the captive recapture. The PALAC 550%, is that a pro forma estimate of RBC, considering the captive or is that before the recapture would have occurred? Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: It's the latter, Tom. So that is simply the separation of the businesses between the two legal entities but then does not reflect the additional steps that we took subsequent to that. So that is not reflective of what we think the RBC will be for PALAC when you look towards year-end. Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI : And am I thinking about it correctly in that there should be a substantial increase in reported RBC from, whether it's pro forma or we're just talking about the likely impact at year-end. Are we going to see a doubling in the RBC or something directionally that high? I just want to get a sense for \u2013 to where that's likely to trend, and I don't need a precise answer but just directionally. And then a related question, is 400% still the right RBC target considering I think you have another measure of CTE that might supersede the way you're evaluating capital adequacy post recapture? Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: So good questions, Tom. So on the first \u2013 the latter part of it, yeah. When we think about that annuity as a legal entity, we really think about it as the way in which we manage it economically and we've articulated in the context of the CTE 97. Importantly, I always footnote that with the CTE 97 through moderately stressed scenarios. So it's to maintain that even in more adverse circumstances than we face today. When you manage that way, the actual RBC calculation can get kind of funny on you. So, yes, you could see something like in the order of magnitude of what you described in terms of the impact of our RBC within PALAC and the 400%, therefore, becomes a much less meaningful number to evaluate it against. And it's much better to think about it in the context of where we are against that CTE 97. Back at PICA, which is sort of once you've split PALAC out; we still believe that the 400% is the appropriate way to be looking at the PICA legal entity. Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI : Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow up on the higher estimated gross profits and variable annuities, spending less on hedging, can you simplify this bid for us? What's happening here that's resulting in higher estimated gross profits, really? Presumably you're buying less of something from a hedge standpoint, willing to take more risk, or just altering the way you hedge; is it that you're buying more bonds that are income producing? Can you provide just a little bit more color as to what's going on behind the scenes on the way you're hedging here? Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yes. So, Tom, I'd highlight the following couple of things; first, when we took the rider and we put it together back with the host, you have a decrease in risk by virtue of doing that because you have offsetting risks that you now are able to manage within the same legal entity. So if you think about our economic liability, it has actually declined by almost $1 billion by virtue of having been able to pull those two entities together. So that's your hedging less risk piece of it, because you have got less risk manifesting as a result of the combination of those two entities. The other part of it is that the way in which we're hedging is a good combination of financial instruments, fixed income instruments, and derivatives is a more efficient way for us to hedge. So the very point that you made, where we are using derivatives, I don't want to get overly technical on this, but you're using the swap curve, swap curve is negative to Treasurys. When you're using fixed income instruments, we are actually getting the full benefit of the yield associated with Treasurys; we're buying a lot of Treasurys for that liability. You're actually getting a better yield on that. So it's a combination of we have less risk and therefore need to hedge less and we're using a hedge strategy, which is more efficient and the combination of those two things results in lower costs to manage the risk. That means we have higher estimated gross profits in the future. Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. I actually had one follow-up on the variable annuity capital structure. Just given the Oliver Wyman recommendations that came out this summer, I was curious if you could maybe try to quantify or give us some idea as to what the impact would be if you had managed a CTE 98, both in terms of RBC or maybe actual dollar standpoint. Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yaron, so a couple things. First, let me say more broadly that the terms of our recapture are entirely consistent with the recommendations coming through the OW paper that was prepared for the NAIC. And that is what we anticipated. We went through it and obviously we've been very engaged with our regulators and with the NAIC and OW. With respect to the specific thing that you've identified, the CTE 98, recall that, as I said earlier, we're holding CTE 97 through stressed scenarios. Therefore, we don't view that it's likely that there will be any issue for us with regard to the level of capital that we're holding vis-\u00e0-vis a CTE 98 standard. Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then this is probably for John, you referenced the comments you made with regard to the Fed's proposal for capital requirements and now liquidity standards. And I think you said you're encouraged by the Fed's view or willingness to maybe make some changes with regards to the insurance business model. But I think in the comments that PRU made, there were also some concerns that were raised regarding the current framework. And if the Fed is less willing to move in the direction of an insurance model, how do you see your capital requirements or adequacy in that situation? Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Well, it's Mark. I guess there are two parts to this. You mentioned the liquidity question and then the capital question. And on liquidity, the issues that we've raised have been around both measurement and reporting with respect to liquidity. And it's too early and I wouldn't want to either anticipate or speak for the Fed, but we think we've made construction recommendations that will be carefully considered. With respect to the capital framework, I think the tone of everything, both orally and in writing, has been very much in the direction of trying to get it right for insurance companies, whether in the context of more of a bottoms-up statutory-based framework, which is reflected in the building block approach, or the items that we expect will be appropriately considered in the GAAP-driven consolidated approach. So I think you have to separate the capital question into two parts. One is the framework and the way in which that works and particularly how it deals with things like marking to market either side of the balance sheet and how that's done, things like margins and reserves, things like separate accounts. So there's a list of framework issues. And then separate from that, there's the question of calibration. And you've heard part of our story around variable annuities and how well protected we are between reserves and capital. And you can extrapolate many of those themes to the entire company, and that's kind of what's behind my chronic comment that we believe that we should be able to meet any reasonable capital standards that are set. So working through the framework, I would say that the tone of everything is very much in the direction of being appropriate for insurance. With respect to calibration, it remains to be seen, but, again, we are extraordinarily strong considering the overall loss absorption capacity of the company. Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Humphrey Lee with Dowling and Partners. Please go ahead. Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC : Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Just a follow-up question related to the deferred compensation and the higher expenses in corporate. Can you size the impact for the quarter, specifically for the deferred comp in both corporate and Gibraltar? Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Humphrey, it's Rob. Actually, I think we're going to defer on that. I don't think we want to provide that granular a level of visibility into it. There are number of things that go into that. We identified the things that would account for the larger portion of the amount that we provided to you. But since the topic has come up again, let me just take maybe an extra minute on expenses, because I know it's \u2013 given that it's been raised twice, it's an area of interest. As a firm, we pay a lot of attention to costs. We've been really disciplined about growing our costs over time. If you look back over the last couple of years, what you would see is that our expenses, excluding the initiatives that we've undertaken, actually since 2013 have only grown around 1%. If you include the initiatives in there, then they've grown at only around 3%. And that compares to our AOI growth that's been in excess of 4%. So we've been very disciplined about costs and, therefore, you haven't seen us having to do large cutbacks in our cost structure as a result of being controlled in the way that we've grown it to begin with. Now having said that, we've also been very strategic in how and where we've chosen to invest our expense dollars. And those are the initiatives that we repeatedly referred to. It's very similar, frankly, to the approach that we took coming through the crisis. It was measured, thoughtful and disciplined. But when we see an opportunity to invest and position ourselves ahead of competition, who are cutting back or going in a different direction, we're going to invest for the future and do that. So if you look at the initiative spending that also gives some basis for the rise in overall expenses that we have, we expect that it will generate long-term sustainable top and bottom-line growth for the company. And you can see some of the benefits of that already manifesting themselves. The total gross level of initiative spending is actually much larger than what you see coming through because we're using savings that we're able to harvest from some of our earlier initiatives to pay for some of the initiatives that we're undertaking now. And you're also seeing some of the investments we've made in places like distribution paying off in the form of very strong, for instance, flows in our asset management business. So we're very focused on our costs, controlled in that, being very strategic about where we're investing. And maybe what I'll ask is actually pivot it over to Steve and ask if he wants to elaborate at all on some of that initiative spending and how it's actually affecting the businesses. Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Rob. As Rob mentioned, we're making investments both across our businesses in such areas as our digital properties and data analytics and also within our businesses. And the investments made within our businesses are already starting to pay off. Mark mentioned this in his comments as well. In asset management, we see some of our investments in distribution resulting in significant institutional flows over the past several quarters. In retail asset management, we see our investment in product paying off. In retirement, we see our investment in our business platform paying off in terms of improved sales and improved persistency. And as Rob mentioned, we've been able to largely mitigate the cost of these investments through continued effective management of, if you will, the day-to-day operating costs of our business platforms. So it's a situation where we are both able to invest in the future and deliver solid results today. Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC : Thank you for the color. And maybe shifting gears a little bit; for Group Insurance, sales declined by double digits year-over-year. There is some commentary about the pricing in the marketplace getting a little bit irrational, so maybe you can share some of your observations in the marketplace in terms of competition and pricing? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Humphrey, it's Steve. Third quarter results in group sales don't tend to be really all that meaningful. As you're aware, the significant quarter for group sales is the first quarter. But I would say, generally speaking, we see this continuing to be a competitive marketplace, and we have been able to be more competitive in the marketplace while still maintaining a very well controlled sales and well-priced sales. We've been able to be more effective through rigorous expense management and through development of a very strong value proposition in the business. So we're confident in our ability to win new business, but we will do it at the right kind of price and on a well-controlled basis. Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC : Thank you for the comment. Alan Mark Finkelstein - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Tony, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. That will come from Michael Kovac with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Michael Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on the cash flow as it relates to the variable annuity recapture. Understanding that we freed up about $1 billion of cash here on sort of a one-time basis, but with the more stable cash flow over time, it sounds like you committed to the 60% cash flow to operating income as sort of still a run rate. Can you give us a sense as to why or why not, why this wouldn't change going forward given the more stable cash flows out of the VA business? Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yes, Michael. So we look at that ratio holistically across the company as opposed to any given business. There are certain businesses which will the above that ratio and other businesses that will be below that ratio. And that's really \u2013 I like to describe it as an input, not an output, and the reason for that is we have a very high ROE as a company. And therefore we have opportunities within our businesses to reinvest our free cash flow back into those businesses at those high returns in order to generate growth and returns that are in excess of our cost of capital. So from our standpoint we try to balance the level of reinvestment we are making into our businesses to target where we are producing, where we have the opportunities to grow and where those opportunities grow at sustained high ROEs. And so we could push that cash flow ratio up quite easily, but we would then starve our businesses in the form of organic growth. We think that would have a negative impact on our ROE in the long term and in our market positioning. On the other hand, we can drive it down much lower, but that would then cause us to be investing in things that would have, on the margin, lower ROEs. So it's a balance for us and a targeted number and we are very comfortable with that 60% on a go-forward basis. Michael Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's helpful. And if I could, one follow up, on organic growth. Saw it come through across a couple of segments, I kind of wanted to focus on the asset management, investment management segment. One, could you give us an update on what you're seeing from a competitive landscape? And we did see kind of earlier this month that the PGIM along with some others lowered fees on several products, so sort of your thoughts there in terms of those moves and the competitive outlook for organic growth going forward? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Michael, this is Steve. We do see across the industry that there has been some pressure on fees that goes across active and passive strategies for the past few years. The DOL rule will continue to support and possibly accelerate that trend. We still see ourselves as being very, very competitive in that context. While we see different types of flows in different parts of the business, certainly in our equities business, we've not been immune from the shift from active to passive. We've seen that in our equity business, particularly in the traditional U.S. style box strategies. However, we're responding to that through investing in our growth in areas within equities that have shown greater resilience in that active to passive trend; global, international, income oriented and factor-based investing in our quantitative management business. And then also the very nature of the multi-manager business itself. Even as we see some degree of outflows in equity like other active managers, we've seen very robust positive flows in fixed income and real estate and strong origination levels in privates and mortgages. We've had those positive institutional flows for 13 straight years, and that gives us confidence in our prospects. I'd also mention that if you relate kind of equities to fixed income, certainly, equity strategies by and large have a higher fee basis than fixed income. But because of the high margins and the particularly attractive scale economies in our fixed income business, we only need somewhat less than $1.50 of positive fixed income flows to offset the impact of $1 of negative equity flows, despite the lower fees that might be pertinent to fixed income business. So between the multi-manager strategy and our competitiveness across different asset classes, we feel ourselves very well prepared to compete, even as we do see some secular (59:58) downward on fees. Michael Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. That's helpful. Operator : Thank you very much.

And with that, I will hand it over to John. John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 2016 was a solid year for Prudential, and we continue to show good momentum across our businesses. I will provide you some higher level observations on our results for the fourth quarter and full year, the underlying fundamental trends in our businesses, capital deployment, and regulation. I'll then hand it over to Mark and Rob to go through the specifics. Fourth quarter operating earnings of $2.43 per share, which excludes a $0.03 benefit from market driven and discrete items, exceeded the $2.07 we reported a year ago. Recall that we typically experience elevated expenses in the fourth quarter, which we estimate to be $0.21 per share in this year's quarter. Otherwise, results for the current quarter benefited from solid core growth across our businesses, good underwriting experience, and favorable spread income, including higher than expected non-coupon investment returns and prepayment income. Net income was $0.65 per share in the quarter or about $1.80 per share below core operating income. A closer alignment of our operating and net income and reducing overall volatility have been key strategic focuses for us over the last couple of years. With the election, we experienced significant movements in Treasury rates, credit spreads, and currencies, which resulted in mark-to-market accounting net losses for the quarter. However, the vast majority of these losses were driven by the component of our variable annuity reserve that we don't deem economic and therefore don't hedge. The net impact to earnings from other derivatives was fairly modest. I will now briefly discuss full-year results. Operating earnings, excluding market driven and discrete items was $9.65 per share for the year, or slightly below the 2016 guidance range which we established in December of 2015. ROE for the full year was 12.7%. While our segment core operating results were consistent with guidance, we did experience higher corporate expenses than we had anticipated, in part due to a number of inherently variable or episodic items. Examples of this include higher long-term and deferred compensation expenses related to stronger than expected equity returns, including our share price, higher legal costs, and losses on a tax-advantaged investment. Net income for the year was $9.71 per share, which is in line with adjusted operating income excluding market driven and discrete items. While there are moving parts from quarter to quarter, we are pleased to see the consistency of these two measures on a full year basis. Adjusted book value per share growth was a solid 7.3% for the year, which is after paying $2.80 in dividends. I will now touch on key fundamental trends in our businesses, starting with our International businesses. Our International operations experienced strong sales growth in 2016. Constant dollar sales grew 8% for the full year and 5% for the fourth quarter, despite a challenging interest rate environment, most notably in Japan, our largest overseas market. We have been able to leverage a broad U.S. dollar product portfolio that more than mitigated pricing and product actions taken on yen-based products in response to the lower interest rate environment. For the year, our U.S. dollar product sales in Japan increased 53%, which contrasts with a 12% decline in yen-based products. In addition, we saw growth in both our Life Planner and Life Consultant field forces while maintaining strong productivity levels. The environment is challenging. However, we continue to expect solid core growth, earnings and cash flow out of our International businesses. Moving on to our Domestic Businesses. While growth in earnings trends differ across our Asset Management, Retirement, and protection businesses, at an overall level, we continue to see good momentum. Asset Management has been a particular highlight, generating positive net flows from unaffiliated third parties of $5.7 billion for 2016, including $900 million in the fourth quarter. Our net flows are benefiting from our initiatives to expand distribution and product offerings and our solid overall investment performance. And while we are not immune to the industry net flow challenges affecting active equity strategies, we benefit from our diversified platform and scale with over $1 trillion of Assets Under Management. 2016 also marks our 14th consecutive year of positive institutional flows. Retirement also had a strong year with net flows of $5.8 billion and 5% account value growth over the year-end 2015, and we continue to see favorable long-term growth prospects. We are also pleased with the strong underwriting performance we have experienced, particularly in our pension risk transfer business. Annuity sales and net flows are showing pressure as evidenced by lower sales in both the fourth quarter and the full year. Our product diversification efforts enable us to show smaller year-over-year variable annuity sales declines than peers in 2016, but we're not immune to broader industry pressures, including the impact of regulatory uncertainty. Having said that, we continue to believe in the long-term value proposition and return potential of annuities, and believe the actions we are taking to restructure our annuities business during 2016 will substantially reduce the capital volatility and improve the earnings and cash flow prospects for this business. And to round out our businesses, our Individual Life and Group Insurance protection businesses are showing positive sales and top-line growth trends. We are pleased to see favorable mortality in our Individual Life business in the fourth quarter following adverse experiences in the first three quarters. As we commented, mortality experience can fluctuate over shorter time periods, but our overall underwriting experience has been positive over a multi-year period. Group Insurance had a good year, producing benefit ratios at the lower end of our expected range, and has started to show top-line momentum after a period of declines which followed pricing and underwriting actions. I will now turn to capital deployment. We returned over $900 million of capital to shareholders in the fourth quarter through dividends and share repurchases, which brings our full year shareholder return to $3.2 billion. This is on top of the roughly $530 million spent on our investment in AFP Habitat, a Chilean retirement services provider. 2016 was a particularly strong year for share repurchases, benefiting from capital freed up from our annuity restructuring, as well as gains from our Japan capital hedge to supplement the strong cash generation in our businesses. We believe in a balanced approach to capital deployment, including returning capital to shareholders and investing in our businesses. For 2017, the board has authorized $1.25 billion of share repurchases, and yesterday we announced a 7% increase in our quarterly dividend. Our annualized dividend has nearly doubled over the last five years, growing at an annual rate of 13%, reflecting our stronger and more consistent cash generation. And finally, it's been an eventful couple of weeks in respect to regulation, with directives from President Trump requesting the DOL to examine the fiduciary rule and the Department of Treasury to review their current regulatory oversight of the financial system more broadly. We strongly support an effective regulatory environment and the protections it provides; however, we also believe a reevaluation of both standards is appropriate in order to address among other factors any unintended consequences, and therefore we support these actions taken by the new administration. And in the meantime, there is considerable uncertainty on where both of those directives will ultimately land, and as a consequence, we continue to manage our business following the current framework. With that, I'll hand it over to Mark. Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thank you, John. Good morning, good afternoon, or good evening, and thank you for joining our call today. I'll take you through our results, and then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon who will cover liquidity, leverage, and capital highlights. I'll start on slide 2. After-tax adjusted operating income amounted to $2.46 per share for the quarter compared to $1.94 a year ago. After adjusting for a $0.03 per share discrete item, EPS amounted to $2.43 for the quarter, up from $2.07 a year ago. Core performance of our businesses was solid in the quarter, with results benefiting from higher fees in our Asset Management and Annuities businesses, greater spread margins, and continued business growth in International Insurance on a constant currency basis. Non-coupon investment returns and prepayment income were about $65 million above our average expectations in the quarter. We estimate that this tailwind, along with the net impact of favorable underwriting results relative to expectations in our Retirement and Life Insurance Protection businesses and updates of reserves and related items in Individual Life benefited current quarter results by about $0.12 per share. In the comparison of results to a year ago, the contribution of these variable items, together with less favorable currency exchange rates had a net favorable impact of about $0.08 per share. In thinking about our earnings pattern, I would also note that we estimate current quarter expenses for items such as technology and business development, annual policy holder communications, advertising, and other variable costs were about $140 million or $0.21 per share above our quarterly average for the year, consistent with the historical pattern we mentioned when we discussed our third quarter results. On a GAAP basis, including amounts categorized as realized investment gains or losses, and results from divested businesses, we reported net income of $284 million for the current quarter, about $800 million below our after-tax adjusted operating income. This was mainly driven by a negative impact from product derivatives which I will discuss shortly. Slide 3 shows financial highlights for the year. EPS for the year amounted to $9.65, after adjusting for market driven and discrete items, which implies an ROE of 12.7%. As we mentioned in our outlook call in December, we are not immune to the multiyear impact of low interest rates in our two primary markets, the U.S. and Japan, and we continue to make strategic investments in our businesses that have longer term paybacks. As a consequence, in December we moderated our ROE expectations to a 12% to 13% range in the near to intermediate term. The full-year EPS comparison reflects less favorable currency exchange rates in 2016, along with a greater tailwind benefit in 2015 from underwriting experience that was more favorable than our average expectations. Underwriting results, plus the net impact of other variable items we called out, had a negative impact of about $0.55 per share on the comparison of results year-over-year. Moving to Slide 4, results for the quarter include a single market driven and discrete item from the settlement of legal matters in the Retirement business. Our quarterly market and experience unlocking in the Annuities business was insignificant. Moving to Slide 5, our GAAP net income of $284 million in the current quarter includes amounts characterized as pre-tax net realized investment losses of $824 million and divested business results and other items outside of adjusted operating income amounting to net pre-tax losses of $313 million. Of note, product-related embedded derivatives and hedging had a negative impact of $1.3 billion. The largest single driver was the impact on non-performance risk or NPR from applying tighter credit spreads to a smaller gross GAAP liability for Annuities living benefit, which decreased due to rising interest rates in the quarter. Essentially, the reduction in NPR was greater than the decrease in the GAAP gross reserve that we consider non-economic and don't hedge, driving the loss. We did also see some modest net hedge breakage of roughly $200 million in the quarter due to the volatility in the post election period. Our hedging program was 95% effective in the quarter. The current quarter pre-tax loss from divested businesses was mainly a result of negative mark-to-market on duration management derivatives in long-term care. Moving to our business results and starting on slide 6, I'll discuss the comparative results excluding the market driven and discrete items I've mentioned. Annuities earnings were $422 million for the quarter, up by $19 million from a year ago. The increase was mainly driven by more favorable net investment results, including current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees about $10 million above our average expectations. In addition, results benefited from a greater net fee contribution due to our recent risk management refinements. Higher expenses, including business development costs were a partial offset. The sequential quarter decline in earnings was mainly driven by seasonally higher expenses, which for Annuities were about $10 million greater in the fourth quarter than the quarterly average for the year and by lower fees, mainly driven by lower average account values. The increase in return on assets or ROA from a year ago to 107 basis points reflects the benefit of our changes in risk management strategy. Quarterly return on assets can vary from a baseline, and as we had noted in the third quarter, benefited from some items that were stronger than we would expect as a base case. Slide 7 presents our annuity sales. Total sales in the quarter are down roughly $400 million from a year ago, mainly from HDI, which represented about half of current quarter sales. The decline is directionally consistent with the lower levels of variable annuity sales across the industry, and we believe the continuing uncertainty associated with distributors adapting to the new DOL regulations was a contributor. Sales of our fixed income-based PDI product are also down from a year ago and sequentially, reflecting a repricing action in September. For the year, more than two-thirds of our gross sales represented new business without retained exposure to equity market linked living benefit guarantees, reflecting our successful product diversification efforts and external reinsurance for new business through the end of 2016 sharing HDI rider risks. Turning to slide 8, Retirement earnings were $298 million for the quarter, up $130 million from a year ago. The increase was driven by a greater contribution from net investment results, more favorable case experience and lower expenses. The contribution from net investment results was up $98 million from a year ago. Current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees were about $30 million above our average expectations compared to a contribution of about $20 million below expectations a year ago. Higher spread based account values and our ALM strategies also contributed to the stronger net investment results. Current quarter case experience was about $10 million more favorable than our average expectation. Our pension risk transfer business continues to perform well, and we've benefited from over $100 million of favorable case experience over the past two years. The sequential quarter increase in earnings included the contribution from about $3 billion of new funded pension risk transfer business that closed late in the third quarter. Turning to slide 9, total Retirement gross deposits and sales were $8.9 billion for the current quarter, compared to $8.3 billion a year ago. Gross sales of institutional investment products in the current quarter amounted to about $4 billion, including roughly $2 billion of mainly funded new pension risk transfer cases and $1 billion of stable value wraps. The modest negative net flows in the quarter reflect the episodic nature of the large case business, both in pension risk transfer and full service, as you can see looking over the full year results. Net flows for the year were about $6 billion, including about $4 billion for standalone institutional products and $2 billion in full service. The institutional net flows included about $5 billion of new funded pension risk transfer cases which more than offset our runoff of the in-force business. Turning to slide 10, Asset Management earnings were $224 million for the quarter, compared to $198 million a year ago. The increase was driven by higher asset management fees, partially offset by a $15 million lower contribution from Other Related Revenues, which included a $10 million gain in the year-ago quarter from a legacy portfolio disposition. The increase in asset management fees reflected greater fees from management of fixed income assets driven by growth in Average Assets Under Management and also reflected the benefit of a fee rate restructuring in real estate in mid-2016, both partially offset by lower fees tied to equities. The Asset Management business reported about $900 million of net positive unaffiliated third party flows in the quarter, excluding money market activity. Net institutional flows of $2.5 billion driven by fixed income strategies were partly offset by retail outflows driven by equities. For the year, we reported $5.7 billion of positive unaffiliated third party net flows, another strong year for our important Asset Management business. Turning to slide 11, Individual Life earnings were $138 million for the quarter, compared to $119 million a year ago. The increase in earnings was driven by a greater contribution from net investment results and more favorable claims experience, which together had a favorable impact of about $50 million on the comparison of results. Earnings for the current quarter included income from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, about $15 million above our average expectations, and a contribution from claims experience, also about $15 million more favorable than average expectations. Going the other way, current quarter results included a negative impact of about $25 million from updates of reserves and related items, including an unusually large impact from periodic true-ups such as actual to expected in-force business. Expenses were also modestly higher in the current quarter than a year ago. Turning to slide 12, individual life sales based on annualized new business premiums were essentially unchanged from a year ago but up by $40 million from the third quarter. The sequential quarter increase came mainly from Guaranteed Universal Life and Other Universal Life, including tax and estate planning sales that tend to peak in the fourth quarter. In addition, the current quarter reflected accelerated purchases in advance of price increases and face amount limits we recently implemented for our Guaranteed Universal Life products. Turning to slide 13, Group Insurance earnings were $43 million for the quarter, up by $16 million from a year ago. Current quarter results benefited from lower expenses, including the impact of nonlinear items such as premium taxes, and a greater contribution from net investment results, including current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, slightly more favorable than our average expectations. Underwriting results were solid but less favorable than a year ago. The total benefits ratio remained at the favorable end of our targeted range of 87% to 91%. Moving to International Insurance and turning to slide 14, earnings for our Life Planner business were $395 million for the quarter, compared to $367 million a year ago. Excluding a $22 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, earnings increased by $50 million from a year ago. Current quarter results benefited from continued business growth, with constant dollar insurance revenues up 6% from a year ago, lower expenses and more favorable policy benefits experience with mortality about $15 million more favorable than our average expectations. Turning to slide 15, Gibraltar Life earnings were $360 million for the quarter compared to $371 million a year ago. Excluding a negative impact of $26 million on the comparison from foreign currency exchange rates, earnings are up by $15 million from a year ago. Current quarter results benefited from business growth, including the contribution from our investment in AFP Habitat in Chile and stronger net investment results driven mainly by increased portfolio size. Mortality in the quarter was roughly consistent with our average expectations versus about $15 million more favorable than expected a year ago. Turning to slide 16, International Insurance sales on a constant dollar basis were $727 million for the current quarter, up $35 million or 5% from a year ago. This sales growth was driven by a 41% increase in our sales of U.S. dollar products in Japan which more than offset lower yen-based sales. U.S. dollar products comprised more than half of our sales in Japan for each of the past three quarters and the year, compared to just over one-third of our sales in 2015. This change in mix reflects our adaptation of the product portfolio to the current environment, including reductions in crediting rates and commissions and in some cases, sale suspensions for yen products that are most affected by interest rates. We are continuing to benefit from our longstanding competitive advantage in distribution of U.S.-dollar products in Japan, emphasizing recurring premium death protection products with returns mainly based on mortality and expense margins. Life Planner sales in Japan were up 15% from a year ago, reflecting an 8% increase in agent count driven mainly by recent sales manager appointments together with higher average premium size. Gibraltar sales were essentially unchanged from a year ago, an 8% sales increase from our Life Consultants, driven mainly by higher average premium size was offset by lower bank channel sales. The decline in bank channel sales included the effects of terminating sales of single premium yen-based products. Sales outside Japan are up 3% from a year ago, driven by continued growth in Brazil. Turning to slide 17, the corporate and other loss was $441 million for the current quarter, compared to a $378 million loss a year ago. The increased loss was driven by higher expenses, including variable items such as initiative costs and compensation programs that are linked to equity returns, including our share price. Lower interest expense, reflecting our pay downs of debt over the past year was a partial offset. Higher expenses drove the sequential quarter increase in the loss. Of the company's $140 million overall excess to fourth quarter expenses in relation to the quarterly average for the year that I mentioned earlier, about $80 million resides in Corporate & Other. Now I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon. Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. I'm going to provide an update on key balance sheet items and financial measures starting on slide 18. While statutory results are not yet final, we estimate that our composite RBC for our U.S. insurance subsidiaries on a comprehensive basis will be well above our 400% target as of year-end. Following the recapture of our living benefit risks and the refinements we made to our risk management strategies, most of the contract risks and supporting capital for annuities reside in our PALAC statutory entity. Therefore, we view this composite RBC position as a primary measure of our financial strength. We expect both PALAC and Prudential Insurance to separately report strong RBC positions in relation to our target as well. In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margins of 858% and 975% respectively as of September 30. These solvency margins are comfortably above our targets. Looking at liquidity, leverage, and capital deployment highlights on slide 19, cash and liquid assets at the parent company amounted to $4.5 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of about $1 billion from September 30. This reflects cash inflows during the quarter, net of the impact of about $900 million returned to shareholders including dividends and $625 million of share repurchases. Capital flows to the parent company in the quarter included roughly $1 billion from PALAC, driven by earnings from the Annuities business over the past year. We are continuing to manage the product risks on an economic basis, including the ability to maintain a CTE 97 threshold through moderate stress scenarios and we are benefiting from greater certainty of cash flows and reduced capital volatility as outcomes of the risk management refinements we implemented. We expect the more stable earnings and capital in our Annuities business to support ongoing distributions. Our financial leverage and total leverage ratios as of year-end remained within our targets. And as John noted, we returned $3.2 billion to shareholders during the year through dividends and share repurchases and announced a 7% increase in our quarterly dividend yesterday. Now, I'll turn it back over to John. John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thank you, Rob. Thank you, Mark. We'd like to open it up to questions. Operator : Certainly. And our first question will come from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Erik Bass - Autonomous Research : Hi. Thank you. John, just a question for you. You've talked about the steps to reduce reported volatility including the changes to yen accounting and the VA captive. I think with the market moves this past quarter, below the line noise has re-emerged as a concern for some insurance investors. So are there any other initiatives you are contemplating to kind of further reduce some of the non-economic noise in PRU's results? John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: So I think I'm going to suggest, Erik, that Rob take that question. Rob? Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: So, Erik, this is an ongoing initiative for us. When we look back over the last four, five, six years, we identified that the two primary sources of breakage for us between our reported GAAP results and the operating earnings that we share with you came from the FX remeasurement issue that you alluded to and then from our Annuities business. And so we have undertaken initiatives to solve for the, I'll say the 80% to 85% of the noise that's been created over the last couple of years. Within our Annuities business, we haven't finished, but we've gotten substantially there. So we are continuing to do some work in order to take out some of the remaining volatility, some of which you saw this quarter. And then there's the remaining 15% to 20%, and yes we have identified initiatives there that we think may help to eliminate that. So, we care a lot about cash flow. We also recognize that GAAP matters to investors and it matters to the creation of book value growth, and so we continue to stay on that. Erik Bass - Autonomous Research : Thank you. And then I think you have also recently made some pricing changes for both the PDI product and VAs and then some Individual Life products. With interest rates now moving somewhat higher, how do you think about the trade-off between higher new business margins and adjusting pricing to make the products more attractive to consumers and drive more sales? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Erik, it's Steve. I'll take that part of your question. We're always looking to strike the right balance between the factors that you mentioned. For example, our \u2013 this quarter's sales in Annuities reflected the fact that Mark spoke about. At the end of the third quarter, we had a trimming of the benefit in our PDI product, and that resulted from reduced sales throughout the quarter. However, we have a highly distinctive capability, distinctive in the industry in our Annuities business to reprice both PDI and HDI as often as monthly, and so we do have the ability to respond to market developments and to act nimbly in our balancing of the factors you mentioned. In fact, on PDI, we already took a modest step in that direction at the very end of the year, increasing some of the payout rates. And as and when market conditions allow us to continue that path, we will do so. We're always looking to write business on a sustainable and profitable basis. Erik Bass - Autonomous Research : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Nadel with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning, everybody. I guess a broad question, but with the move higher in rates \u2013 and I realize we're sort of flat year-over-year, but certainly higher since the election. As you think about where \u2013 how much more do we need to go I guess globally to get to sort of a blended stability on your portfolio yield? Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: So, John, it's Rob. Let me take a stab at that. The way I would think about it is, I'd look at the comparison of our portfolio yield to new money rates and then use that as sort of a metric for \u2013 we want to get to the point where the roll-off in the portfolio is not creating further drag on the overall yield by virtue of where we can invest. In the U.S., our new money rates are around 3.5%. The portfolio roll-off in the course of the next couple years is going to be 4% to 4.25%, somewhere in that order of magnitude. So we got about another, call it another 75 basis points of interest rate rise between a combination of underlying Treasuries and credit spreads in order to close the gap between where we're putting new investments on the books and where old investments are rolling off the books. If you look at the Japan portfolio, recognizing that that is a mix of both U.S. and yen liabilities, the portfolio yield there is around 3% and our new money rates are around 2.5%. So we've got a little over 50 basis points of negative yield there that we have to make up. That would come from a combination of both rising rates in the U.S. and rising rates in Japan. John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: That's really helpful. Thank you. And then I guess my follow-up question is \u2013 and focusing on a couple of the below the line items, the impact from the divested businesses this quarter, would you characterize that impact running through net income as also largely non-economic? And if so, what drove that? Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yeah, so \u2013 yeah, we would think of that being entirely noneconomic. The divested businesses, the primary drivers are going to be two things. One, our Closed Block Business, and that is entirely non-economic in that the result of that business over time are passed through to the policy holders. So it has no economic impact to the shareholders of the company. The second item in there is our long-term care business, and what you saw in there was actually \u2013 from an operating standpoint, it's generating modest profits as you would expect, given when we wrote down the book. It's generating profits that from \u2013 from an underwriting standpoint and from the earnings that we get off our surplus that we have in that business. But you have the \u2013 there are a certain number of derivatives that are managing \u2013 that are helping us to manage the portfolio there, because it's a very long liability and you've got a mark-to-market on those derivatives as interest rates rose. So the entire loss you saw within long-term care in fact is more than attributed to the mark on that derivative offsetting the modest level of profits we are otherwise getting out of it. So we would consider that to be non-economic therefore as well. Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yeah, with no corresponding mark on the liabilities. Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yes, sorry. Thanks, Mark. John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yeah, understood. And, I mean, I understand that there's some work going on at FASB around that. Is that your understanding as well? And if so, I mean, any guess on how long it takes to get to the point where we get a little bit closer to matching up the impact on the left versus the right side of the balance sheet? John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Well, FASB has a proposal out which would go in the right direction. So the initial proposal out by FASB would now include a mark-to-market concept on both the left and the right-hand side of the balance sheet, which I think would be helpful and as I said, a step in the right direction. The concern that we have is that the details matter on how you go about doing that. And so, you don't want to solve for that problem and then create other volatility and non-economic outcomes by virtue of getting the discount rates wrong that you're using on the asset side and the liability side. So there are a number of issues that we have with the FASB proposal, so we think it's generally headed in the right direction. We think it needs some fine-tuning in order to get it quite right so that \u2013 so in fact the new proposal is a net good as opposed to trading one level of noise for a different level of noise. John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks very much. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Suneet Karnath at Citigroup. Your line is open. Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to start with the ROE. Going back to the outlook call, where you took the guidance for the near-term down from 13% to 14% to 12% to 13%. I think you had said that the primary driver of that was rates, although there were some other factors. But I'm trying to reconcile that 100 basis point reduction in ROE guidance to the interest rate sensitivity that you show in the same deck where I think you said a 100 basis point increase or swing in ten-year Treasuries is only a $0.15 to $0.20, and that's a pretty modest impact on ROE. So I'm just trying to reconcile the two. John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: So let me take a stab at that, Suneet. The effect of interest rates is a compounding effect, and so when we first established our 13% to 14% outlook for ROE, it was a point in time where interest rates were about 100 basis \u2013 our outlook for interest rates were about a 100 basis points higher than they are today. We've had several years now of rates being below that expectation, and it's the compounding effect of that every year as the portfolio rolls and as we're putting on new business and making new investments, that leads \u2013 that created the drag on the ROE. And so, by contrast it will then, therefore, take us a couple of years of interest rates being back up at 100 basis points in order to build back to what we think is that longer term sustainable ROE of 13% to 14 %. Does that help? Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah, that does. I just was wondering, is another factor in there this recurring premium products that you sell in Japan just given that rates have had such a big move to the downside in that country? John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Let me take one stab at that, and then if Charlie wants to add any commentary, he can. Obviously the impact on our returns are felt both in the U.S. and in Japan. So, yes, we are seeing lower rates in Japan across our products. So those products where we were more rate sensitive, we view the \u2013 done pricing adjustment or we've discontinued sales of that \u2013 of those products. I would note, however, that our returns in Japan are actually quite competitive, and so we have a very high ROE out of our Japan business, and therefore the compression that we felt with \u2013 as a result of lower rates in Japan, while it's had a negative impact, we still produce very attractive returns there. Charlie, I don't know if you wanted to elaborate on that. Charles F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.: No, I think you do \u2013 I guess the only thing I would \u2013 I'd kind of add two points to this. I think the real driver of our ROE is our business mix. And there are some factors, interest rates, et cetera, that have some effect over time, but you've seen us when we came out of the financial crisis articulating 13% to 14% and then exceeding that when we had the wind at our backs, but we also \u2013 we never raised that goal because we knew we were benefiting from tailwinds. We didn't want to chase returns, so we want to preserve our ability to invest in our business in ways that didn't always have an immediate positive effect on ROE. We have continued to think exactly the same way, and if we find the interest rate environment is a sustainably more favorable one, our business mix is going to drive stronger outcomes. And in the meantime, actually our biggest focus around this also is relative performance. We think our business mix should drive superior performance in relationship to our peers, and that's been historically reflected and we would expect that would continue on from today. Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): That's helpful, John. Just second question, just a follow up I think on Erik Bass's line of questioning in terms of the below the line noise. Was there any impact from those items on your statutory performance in the quarter, or was it all GAAP? Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: So the mark-to-market on derivatives will affect both GAAP and statutory. For us, that derivative impact was relatively modest. I'm talking about the portfolio management derivatives. The noise that got created as a result of the Annuities business, the non-economic component of the liability and the NPR that offsets that non-economic component are outside of our statutory construct. So our statutory construct isn't identical to, but largely mirrors the economic construct that we have put together from a GAAP standpoint. So that portion of the noise which dominated the delta between reported operating earnings and GAAP is entirely non-economic in both a GAAP and a statutory context. Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. How big was that marked number that you just referenced that will affect stat? Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: The derivatives piece, I don't know that we have disclosed that, but it was not a particularly material number. Our net derivatives are relatively modest from a duration standpoint. The notional amount we have outstanding there has been substantially decreased over the course of the last several years. In fact, it's like half what it used to be a handful of years ago. We've been encouraging our portfolios as they do their ALM to increasingly utilize cash instruments over derivative instruments, so was not a particularly material impact. Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Your line is open. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I had a question for Charlie. Can you talk about the potential impact to Japan sales ahead of and following the April discount rate reduction? Charles F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Sure. So as you know, in July of last year, the standard valuation interest rate for the yen single premium whole life products decreased to 25 basis points, and we think potentially in April of this year, the discount rate for reserves for recurring premium product will decrease from 1% down to 25 basis points. Our view is that we have adapted in the past in terms of pricing and products and we'll continue to do so in the future. So, we don't anticipate a meaningful impact on our capital levels or solvency margins. For example, we have already discontinued all our Japanese yen single premium whole life offerings through all our channels. We did that last year. And don't forget that this new change in discount rates will only apply to new business. So we should be able to manage the efforts of the new rules. It may involve some repricing of products as we go forward, but we'll take that as it comes. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: And then somewhat related, have you seen any domestic competitors start to offer more U.S. dollar denominated products, or is it more isolated to the international competitors that operate in Japan? Charles F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.: We have seen \u2013 we have seen some \u2013 or we have heard a fair amount of talk about it, and we're beginning to see a little of it. But the way \u2013 where we have seen it has been primarily in the bank channel. So we think there will be more competition in the future, but let's \u2013 let's review the bank channel for a minute, because I think it's quite interesting. So for us, the bank channel is about \u2013 it's less than a quarter of what we sell. Obviously most of what we sell is through our tied agency systems with Life Planners and life plan consultants, and most of what we sell is death protection. So two-thirds of what we sell is death protection. And where we're seeing the competition come in is not so much on the recurring premium product, especially recurring premium U.S. dollar product. We really haven't seen any competition from anyone there yet. We have seen a little bit on the single premium U.S. dollar product, and we have seen some on the recurring premium yen denominated dollar product. But \u2013 and we don't sell any more single premium yen denominated products. So we have seen some come in and will probably see a little bit more, but we also think we have a competitive advantage when it comes to selling death protection, either through the bank channel or through our tied agency system. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore. Your line is open. Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC : Hi. First, just a follow-up question to Rob. I think you mentioned new money yields related to the Japan portfolio is running at around 2.5%. Is that \u2013 can you split that up between how much of your cash flows you're \u2013 being invested to back the U.S. dollar portfolio versus how much is being \u2013 is backing the yen portfolio? That just seems like a high number relative to at least yen cash flows. Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: It's a good question, Tom. I don't have those numbers off the top of my head, so it's something we'd have to follow up with you on. I think we do provide that. I just don't have it immediately at my fingertips. Charles F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Let me just \u2013 let me throw out a couple of numbers. And so if you look at our whole portfolio, about 45% is JGBs, and then there's about another 25% that's probably Japanese corporates, and then you have \u2013 then you have U.S. product as well. So when you look at our overall portfolio, it's really high quality. So you have 45% that's JGBs, you have 85% that's fixed income, you have 97% of that is investment grade, and of the other 15%, it's really investment grade surrogates, right. So that's where you get some other U.S. dollar product; you get private placements, you get mortgages, you get other things. So in general, it's \u2013 one, it's a very high quality stable portfolio; and two, you have a fair proportion of U.S. dollar product in there. And that's what raises the yield. Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: So, well, Charlie bought me some time. I was able look up the \u2013 look up some numbers for you. So if you look at the total international portfolio, call it around a $175 billion, about $100 billion of that would be in yen products and about $75 billion of that would be in other currencies, primarily in U.S. and Aussie dollar. Charles F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.: But at the margin, more U.S. dollar business is coming in. Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yeah. That's a good point. Charles F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.: You heard the numbers I quoted on the mix of sales, and U.S. dollar sales are now the majority. So we've \u2013 you've got like \u2013 I think the non-yen denominated sales in the last quarter were over 60% of our sales, and so when you think about the incremental dollar flow it's going to be more heavily influenced by sales because we've got a fairly modest turnover in the existing portfolio, given the very long duration of those liabilities. Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. And then how much of the yen cash flows that are coming in are you pivoting more into U.S. dollar investments, like \u2013 I don't need precise numbers, but are you \u2013 if you've been investing 20%, 50% of yen cash flows into U.S. dollar or non-yen type investments, or is it something much smaller than that? Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: We have a relatively small portfolio, Tom, that's invested in \u2013 where we have taken yen liabilities, invested in dollars, and then swapped back to yen, which I think is the strategy that you're talking about. The aggregate of that portfolio is about $5.5 billion. When we first started that, it was a very attractive trade. We were earning 2%, 2.25% in premium over what we could earn if we invested in Japan. Today, that's more like 1.5%. So we continue to selectively pursue it. But it's a \u2013 I think our CIO has referred to it as getting to be a little bit of a crowded trade. So we have some of that, but relatively modest. Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. And then just final question. Rob, in response to, I think it was Eric Bass's question, you were talking about an effort to eliminate the below the line noise and strategies. Can you just expand a bit on that? Would it be significant altering of economics, or are we talking about accounting, legal entity type restructuring where you think you can actually optimize the accounting better without changing the underlying economics much? Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yeah, Tom, we seek to do this without compromising on economics. I think what we did with FX remeasurement is a perfect example of that. What we did is we \u2013 we created a divisional structure within Japan in order to create three functional currencies which then allowed us to eliminate the FX remeasurement issue that was giving rise to \u2013 was occurring as a result of having a single yen denominated functional currency there. So when we look at eliminating that noise, what we're trying to do is look at uneconomic noise and pair that \u2013 and figure out \u2013 or uneconomic ways \u2013 non-economic ways of reducing that noise such that we don't impair the underlying fundamentals of \u2013 and economics of our business. And we think there are levers that allow us to do that. Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss with Bank of America. Your line is open. Seth M. Weiss - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Hi. Thank you. A question on the Retirement and the Asset Management businesses. If you strip out what you consider trend adjustments, Retirement's quarterly run rate appears right around $260 million. There's a significant step-up than where you've been. You commented on some of the fund flow dynamics earlier in the call. Just curious if you could speak to what you think is a sustainable level of run rate quarterly earnings. Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Seth, it's Steve. I'll address your question and talk about how we view trends in core earnings in both of those businesses. First of all, in both businesses, particularly in Retirement, earnings benefited from some items that aren't necessarily trendable as Mark addressed in his review of business results. However, we have seen core progress in the Retirement business, I would say that that core progress very much reflects higher account values in both PRT and Full Service arising from a variety of factors : our sales, our flows, persistency of our business, and in some cases market appreciation. We have seen it reflecting a effective expense management over the course of the year, and we have seen \u2013 we have seen it reflect the benefit of portfolio rotation as we onboard PRT transactions. And what I mean by that is, for example, as we onboard these transactions, we're taking in large amounts of public fixed income assets and we're able to rotate some of those to private fixed income, picking up some yield while still matching the liability very well and not increasing any risk. In the Asset Management business, I would say our core growth in earnings reflects two very basic trends. One, obviously the strength of our flows; and, two, our ability to sustain our fee level on an average basis across the entire platform. Now, that's fairly distinctive, and it's encouraging to us in the sense that even while we're in a period where there's secular pressure on asset management fees, the strength and the diversity of our multi-manager structure and our ability to draw flows in some higher yielding parts of the business, higher fee basis parts of the business has on an average basis enabled us to hold our average fee levels pretty steady. So I would say we are encouraged by the trends in core earnings in both of these businesses. At the same time though, I would say that that progress is reflected in the guidance that we issued in December. Seth M. Weiss - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Great. And on Asset Management you specifically commented on fee rate modifications for certain real estate funds. Does that have a notable improvement in the run rate? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: It's \u2013 it has a double digits impact over the \u2013 double digits of dollars over the course of the \u2013 over the full year. Seth M. Weiss - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Dally with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I had a question on Annuities. The flows deteriorated a fair amount and you highlighted the reasons why. If that continues, I'm guessing the capital strain will be lighter. Would be that be meaningful enough to add to your available capital? Any color on implications to capital would be helpful. Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Nigel, it's Rob. I'll take a stab at that. As a result of \u2013 you know what? Let me actually \u2013 let me step back a little further. Because I think what this really relates to is the success we had with our restructuring of the Annuities business, and maybe it's worth just going through that real quickly and then it leads to sort of the results that I'll describe to you that will answer your question directly. So remember, we did four things when we undertook this restructuring of our Annuities business. First, we took all of the operations that we had and we consolidated them into a more limited number of legal entities primarily, one being PALAC. Two, we eliminated the corporate underhedge. Three, we migrated toward a statutory construct that we think is more reflective of the long-term nature of the risks, and consistent with where the NAIC is going, consistent with our methodology for managing to the CTE 97 that we \u2013 through the cycle that we've historically had in place and consistent with our desire to have AA ratings. And then the fourth thing that we did is we used a combination of derivatives and financial assets to defease the liability, whereas before we were using primarily if not exclusively, derivatives. The immediate results of that were that we have reduced our capital sensitivity to interest rate risk, which has resulted in a stable and higher level of free cash flow \u2013 getting to the question you're asking \u2013 that enables us to have more confidence around our ability to pay dividends and hence what you saw in the fourth quarter was a $1 billion dividend coming out of our Annuities business. We think that going forward, we have \u2013 that is a high cash flow business, and when we have reduced the volatility around the business we have more comfort then in distributing that cash flow out to the parent company and ultimately making it part of our re-deployable capital. That was on top incidentally of, just to remind you, releasing about $1 billion as a result of the combination, $0.5 billion of which we distributed out to shareholders as a special authorization last year. We used the other $0.5 billion to reduce our debt and our leverage. Incidentally, its also led to lower costs. So we have lower risk, lower costs. That's improved AOI coming out of the business as well. So that volatility reduction and capital release and increased earnings all facilitated by the efficiencies coming out of the restructuring, we think enables us to take advantage of what we believe are the very attractive economics in that business, which is high return, high cash flow. The introduction of stability then allows us to translate that into cash flows to the parent company, and as I said, ultimately to shareholders as well. Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Nigel, this is Steve. I'd kind of amplify Rob's remarks and speak to your comment about \u2013 kind of implied in your question about how we see future sales. First of all \u2013 and I'd address it on a product basis. First of all, as I mentioned, our current products, we have the ability to be very nimble on how we keep those competitive. In terms of our forward-looking product plans, these really stem from our business strategy and not from any particular outcome one way or the other on the DOL rule. Our product plans in 2017 and 2018 are simply a continuation of that strategy that's already been successful in 2015 and 2016. We look to operate broader range of solutions to client needs. For example, in the first half of this year we'll enhance our death benefit in a way that will make us more competitive in legacy planning. We're exploring new fixed index annuity solutions, and we're looking to develop and introduce a highly innovative and simplified income solution into the Group benefits market that will enable us to address a broader market segment. And again, all of these are grounded in our business strategy and aren't sensitive to outcomes one way or the other on the DOL fiduciary rule. Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Very helpful. Thank you. Alan Mark Finkelstein - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Cynthia, I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Certainly. And that will be from the line of Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. I had a question around the U.S. dollar denominated product sales in Japan. How much room do you have to continue to grow that, or is kind of this roughly 60% of overall product sold where you want to be? John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: No, I don't think \u2013 I'll answer that in a couple of ways. The first is, I don't think we have a set goal as to where we want to be. And we try and \u2013 just as Steve articulated, in the U.S., we try to provide solutions to our clients, whatever they may be. And that may be in yen product, it may be in dollar product. And also, as Steve said in the very beginning, you look at a balance; you look at a balance between product mix, pricing, and what the consumer wants. So we don't have a goal per se. And the answer is different for the different companies we have there. So in the Life Planner, as an example, U.S. dollar sales increased from 38% this quarter from 27% a year ago. So there's a lot of room to move there. In Gibraltar, we're a little bit higher. So overall, Gibraltar, the U.S. dollar sales are 67% versus 50% a year ago. In Life Consultants, they were 55% so there's room \u2013 there's certainly room there. The bank channel, we are higher; we sell mostly U.S. dollar product because we have eliminated the single premium yen denominated product. And so there isn't as much product on the yen side to sell, and that had to do with the profitability and frankly the efficacy of that product. So U.S. dollar product there was in the 80s; so not quite as much room to grow there, although a little bit. And then in the IA channel, we're at about 50%, which is up from about 30% a year ago. So by giving you these numbers, you see a couple of things; one is our ability to pivot products, and two is the creation of new products because one of the reasons why we were able to sell more dollar denominated product is because we created some new products, especially on retirement income and some whole life products. So I think you'll see we have the ability to do more as we go forward through either product creation or just through the absolute percentages. Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That's helpful. And do you know what percentage \u2013 or do you have handy what percentage of your U.S. dollar denominated products are single premium? John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Oh, single premium? I don't offhand. I will tell you that overall in Japan, 86% of our product is recurring premium. Of the other 14%, 11% is the fixed annuities business, and the fixed annuities business is almost all U.S. dollar. So I would say \u2013 I'll give you those two percentages. We can get back to you with the actual percentage. But I'll leave it at that. Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you.

And with that, I will hand it over to John. John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. We had a very good start to the year, reporting strong earnings and showing continued underlying momentum across our businesses. I will provide some higher level observations on our results for the quarter, the core fundamental drivers in our businesses and capital deployment, and then hand it over to Mark and Rob to go through the specifics. First quarter operating earnings of $2.76, which excludes a $0.03 benefit from market driven and discrete items, exceeded the $2.26 we reported in the first quarter of 2016, which, as you will recall was subject to considerable market headwinds. Our annualized return on equity for this quarter was very good at just over 14% which is above our near to intermediate ROE target of 12% to 13%. Results benefited from particularly strong spread income in the quarter, with our returns on non-coupon investments outperforming our longer-term expectations. We also continue to benefit from solid underlying growth in a number of our businesses such as Retirement, Asset Management and our International businesses. Our underwriting experience on an overall basis was slightly weaker than our average expectations as we experienced adverse mortality results in our life insurance businesses. However, this was largely offset by favorable experience in our longevity businesses, namely our Retirement segment. First quarter has historically shown some larger swings in underwriting experience at the segment level, but we are pleased to see that the benefit of our mix of mortality and longevity businesses moderates these impacts. We also recognized higher expenses in the quarter related to a change to our long-term compensation program. This change only affected the timing of expenses during 2017. As a consequence, we reported certain expenses in the first quarter that, under former plan provisions, would've been spread throughout 2017. But overall it was a good, clean quarter without a lot of noise. Our net income per share of $3.09 was modestly above operating EPS and we continue to show solid adjusted book value per share growth, up 7% over the first quarter of 2016, which is after paying $2.85 in dividends per share. I'll now touch on some key fundamental trends in our businesses, starting with our domestic businesses. We produced record earnings in our Retirement business. While outsize non-coupon investment results and strong case experience were the notable drivers of the earnings strength, which you will hear more from us on, Retirement also benefited from some other smaller items in the quarter. And so while we would be cautious on extrapolating current quarter adjusted results through the remainder of the year, we are very pleased with the underlying earnings trends of the retirement business. We are benefiting from solid account value growth and outstanding underwriting results, particularly from our pension risk transfer block. Asset management had another good quarter, benefiting from positive net flows and stable overall fee rates. Total assets under management of $1.1 trillion, up 7% over the prior year, benefited from $600 million of third-party unaffiliated net flows. Notably, we set a record for unaffiliated third party assets under management of $543 billion. Individual Annuities also had very good results, with earnings equal to the record set in the third quarter of 2016 after adjusting for market driven and discrete items. We are continuing to benefit from strong margins aided by the actions we took last year to more efficiently manage the living benefit risk and reduce capital volatility. Not surprisingly, we did see a sizable decline in variable annuity sales over the prior year, which is consistent with the pressures others in the industry have also experienced with the DOL rule uncertainty. Nevertheless, this is an important business for our franchise and we expect individual annuities to be a solid source of earnings and cash flow. As I mentioned, our Individual Life and Group Insurance protection businesses did experience elevated mortality claims in the quarter which weighed on our results. In the case of Group Insurance, this was mitigated by favorable group disability results. We reported the second lowest disability benefit ratio in five years, which continues to reinforce the success of our recent underwriting actions. Now turning to the International division, I would characterize our International results as solid, with few surprises. Foreign currency continues to be a modest headwind, but overall we are seeing stable quarter growth and continued steady results. Sales overall were strong, up 8% over the prior year on a constant currency basis. This was driven by particular strength in our Life Planner channel, which was up 34%. We did experience a sales surge in advance of a premium rate increase on yen-based products in Japan, but, more broadly, we continue to show good growth in our Life Planner count, solid increases in U.S. dollar product sales and overall favorable fundamentals. Partly offsetting the strength in the Life Planner segment, we experienced lower year-over-year sales at Gibraltar due to declines in the bank channel. Our adherence to profitability standards and the nature of third-party bank distribution does give rise to the potential for more sales variability. In that regard, we terminated sales of certain yen-based products last year in response to interest rate declines and I would add that bank channel sales for the industry are also showing pressure. Moving to capital deployment. We returned $640 million to shareholders in the quarter, which was about equally split between dividends and share repurchases. We have a robust capital position and generate considerable free cash flow. This puts us in a good position to continue to invest in our businesses for long-term growth while also returning large amounts of capital to our shareholders. And finally before handing it over to Mark, I would conclude by observing that there's obviously a fair amount of uncertainty in the broader environment around topics like tax reform, regulation, the direction of interest rates and policies that affect the macroeconomic landscape. While we don't know how all of this will play out, we remain highly active in our advocacy efforts to make sure that our ability to deliver strong customer value while also producing strong shareholder value remains intact. Additionally, we benefit from our superior mix of businesses and diverse sources of earnings, supported by a strong capital position that positions us well to deliver differentiated returns and a high level of free cash flow. And further, this combination puts us in an optimal position to capitalize on opportunities and succeed across a wide variety of outcomes and circumstances. And, with that, I'll turn it over to Mark. Mark? Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thank you, John. Good morning, good afternoon or good evening. Thank you for joining our earnings call today. I'll take you through our results and then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon, who will cover liquidity, leverage and capital highlights. I'm starting on slide two. After-tax adjusted operating income amounted to $2.79 per share for the quarter compared to $2.18 a year ago. After adjusting for $0.03 per share of market-driven and discrete items, EPS amounted to $2.76 for this quarter, up from $2.26 a year ago and implying an ROE of 14.1% on an annualized basis. Core performance of our businesses was strong in the quarter, with earnings from asset-based fees in Asset Management, Annuities and Retirement about $100 million higher than a year ago, driven by market appreciation and positive flows. In addition, results benefited from continued business growth in International Insurance on a constant currency basis as well as greater spread margins, partially offset by higher expenses. As John mentioned earlier, current quarter results also benefited from a few notable or inherently variable items. Non-coupon investment returns and pre-payment income were about $125 million above our average expectations in the current quarter. We experienced modestly unfavorable net underwriting results as compared to our average expectations. This reflects adverse mortality experience in our Life Insurance business which was mostly offset by favorable case experience in our Retirement business. These items together had a net benefit of about $0.15 per share in the current quarter. In addition, current quarter expenses reflect the impact of modification to certain provisions within our long-term compensation program, where a minor change in retiree service requirements triggered a change in the timing of expense recognition. This resulted in an expense of approximately $80 million, or $0.12 per share, which would previously have been recognized in subsequent quarters of 2017. While the plan modification only affects the timing of when certain expenses are recognized in a given year, it is a permanent change and, therefore, will affect the pattern of expenses in future years as well. On a GAAP basis, including amounts categorized as realized investment gains or losses and results from divested businesses, we reported net income of $1.4 billion for the current quarter, about $100 million above our after-tax adjusted operating income. Moving to slide three. For the current quarter, market-driven and discrete items consist only of our quarterly market and experience unlockings in the Annuity business, driven mainly by the performance of equities in our customer accounts, which resulted in a net benefit of $0.03 per share. Turning to slide four. Our GAAP net income of $1.4 billion in the current quarter includes amounts characterized as pre-tax net realized investment gains of $38 million and divested business results and other items outside of adjusted operating income amounting to a net pre-tax gain of $72 million. The current quarter net realized investment gains were driven by pre-tax gains in our International Insurance Investment portfolio, partially offset by losses from other risk management derivatives, including currency hedges, as the yen strengthened modestly during the quarter. Moving to our business results and starting on slide five, I'll discuss the comparative results excluding the market-driven and discrete items that I have mentioned. Annuities earnings were $449 million for the quarter, up by $68 million from a year ago. The increase was driven by a greater contribution from policy charges and fee income, primarily a result of an 8% increase in our variable annuity average account values as well as the continued benefit from our refinement in risk management strategy for product guarantees, which we implemented in 2016. Also contributing to the growth in earnings was more favorable net investment results, including current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and pre-payment fees about $15 million above our average expectations. The increase in return on assets, or ROA, from a year ago to 114 basis points includes the benefit of changes in our risk management strategy for product guarantees as well as more favorable investment results. Quarterly ROA can vary from a baseline and the current quarter and the third quarter of 2016 both benefited from items that were stronger than what we would expect as a base case. Slide six presents our annuity sales. Total gross sales of $1.4 billion in the quarter are down by $600 million from a year ago. This trend in gross sales reflects the actions we have taken to reprice our PDI product as well as the broader industry sales pressure seen, we believe, in response to the anticipation of the DOL fiduciary rule. Turning to slide seven, Retirement earnings were $397 million for the quarter, up by $178 million from a year ago. This increase was driven by a greater contribution from net investment results, more favorable case experience and higher fee income. The contribution from net investment results was up $135 million from a year ago. Current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees were about $65 million above our average expectations, compared to a contribution about $40 million below expectations a year ago. Higher spread-based account values also contributed to the stronger net investment results. Current quarter case experience was about $50 million more favorable than our average expectations, primarily from our pension risk transfer business which continues to perform very well. Turning to slide eight, total Retirement gross deposits and sales were $10.8 billion for the current quarter compared to $8.7 billion a year ago. The increase was driven by higher institutional investment products sales in the current quarter including two longevity reinsurance cases totaling about $2 billion and a modest increase in stable value wrap sales. Total Retirement account values were a record $396 billion, up 6% from a year earlier. This includes the benefit from market appreciation as well as $5 billion of positive net flows over the past year. The modest net outflows in the quarter reflect the episodic nature of the large case business inherent in both full service and institutional investment products, as well as the impact of the normal runoff of group annuity and longevity reinsurance cases. In addition, there was an increase in participant withdrawals due to market activity. Turning to slide nine, Asset Management earnings were $196 million for the quarter compared to $165 million a year ago. The increase was driven by higher Asset Management fees and a greater contribution from other related revenues, partially offset by higher expenses. The increase in Asset Management fees reflected greater fees from growth in fixed income assets under management and the benefit of a fee rate restructuring in real estate in the third quarter of last year. The current quarter included about $25 million of expense related to modifications of certain provisions within our long-term compensation program which I mentioned earlier. Asset Management reported about $600 million of net unaffiliated third party flows in the quarter, excluding money market activity, driven by another quarter of strong fixed income flows. Turning to slide 10, Individual Life earnings were $118 million for the quarter compared to $120 million a year ago. Higher expenses and adverse claims experience were partially offset by a greater contribution from net investment results. Earnings for the current quarter reflected claims experience that was about $50 million below our average expectations compared to claims experience about $35 million below expectations a year ago. We do not adjust our average quarterly expectations for seasonal variances. However, it is not uncommon for us to experience adverse mortality in the first quarter. The higher contribution from net investment results included income from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees about $15 million above our average expectations in comparison to results of about $10 million below our average expectations a year ago. Turning to slide 11, Individual Life sales based on annualized new business premiums were essentially unchanged from a year ago and down about $37 million from the seasonally strong fourth quarter. The sequential quarter decrease came mainly from Guaranteed and Other Universal Life, including tax and estate planning sales that tend to peak in the fourth quarter. The prior quarter also reflected accelerated purchases in advance of price increases and face amount limits we implemented for our Guaranteed Universal Life products. Moving to slide 12, Group Insurance earnings were $34 million for the quarter, up by $8 million from a year ago. The increase came mainly from a greater contribution from net investment results partially offset by less favorable underwriting results and higher expenses. Current quarter earnings included income from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees that were about $15 million more favorable than our average expectations, compared to about $10 million below average expectations a year ago. The current quarter total benefits ratio was at the midpoint of our long-term targeted range of 87% to 91%, reflecting less favorable Group Life experience offset by favorable Group Disability experience. Turning to slide 13, most of our Group Insurance sales occur in the first quarter reflecting calendar year effective dates. Current quarter sales based on annualized new business premiums of $301 million were solid and slightly lower than the year ago quarter. The decrease was driven primarily by the absence of a large life case sale in the year ago quarter partially offset by growth in Disability sales. Moving to International Insurance and turning to slide 14. Earnings for our Life Planner business were $408 million for the quarter compared to $410 million a year ago. Excluding a $13 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, earnings increased by $11 million from a year ago. Current quarter results benefited from continued business growth with constant dollar insurance revenues up 7% from a year ago, partially offset by less favorable policy benefits experience with claims experience about $15 million less favorable than our average expectations. A concentration of annual mode premium revenues in our Life Planner business results in an earnings pattern that favors the first quarter. We estimate that this benefited current quarter results by about $25 million in relation to the quarterly average. Turning to slide 15, Gibraltar Life earnings were $391 million for the quarter compared to $369 million a year ago. Excluding a $2 million negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates, earnings increased by $24 million from a year ago. Current quarter results benefited from business growth including a full-quarter contribution from our investment in AFP Habitat in Chile which was acquired in March of last year. In addition, results reflect the greater contribution from net investment results partially offset by less favorable policy benefit experience. The contribution from net investment results included returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees modestly above our average expectations compared to about $20 million below average expectations a year ago. Mortality experience in the quarter was about $10 million less favorable than our average expectations compared to slightly more favorable than average expectations a year ago. Turning to slide 16, International Insurance sales on a constant dollar basis were $825 million for the current quarter, up by $61 million or 8% from a year ago. This includes a 6% increase in Japan driven by higher Life Planner sales, partially offset by lower bank channel sales in Gibraltar. Life Planner sales in Japan were up 41% from a year ago, reflecting an elevated level of sales in advance of repricing actions associated with the standard discount rate changes on yen-based products effective April 1. Also contributing to the sales increase was an 8% increase in the Life Planner count in Japan driven by sales manager appointments and higher retention. Gibraltar sales were down by 14% from a year ago, driven by a decline in bank channel sales. This includes the effects of terminating sales of single premium yen-based products in 2016, increased competition, as well as the impacts of an industrywide decline in bank channel sales. About half of our sales in Japan in the quarter were from U.S. dollar products. This percentage is down sequentially from 60% in the fourth quarter, reflecting the higher yen-based sales in Life Planner in advance of premium rate changes as well as lower bank channel sales which primarily consist of U.S. dollar products. We continue to benefit from our long-standing competitive advantages in distribution of U.S. dollar products in Japan, emphasizing recurring premium death protection products with returns mainly based on mortality and expense margins. Sales outside Japan are up 18% from a year ago driven by continued growth in Brazil and increased sales in Korea. Turning to slide 17, the Corporate and Other loss was $352 million for the current quarter compared to a $312 million loss a year ago. The increased loss was driven mainly by higher expenses. The current quarter included an expense of about $25 million related to modifications of certain provisions within our long-term compensation plan as I mentioned earlier, and higher compensation expenses that are linked to equity returns including our share price. Going the other way, results reflect lower interest expense from our pay downs of debt last year, a higher contribution from net investment income and higher income from our pension plan following our assumption update at year-end. Now I'll turn it over to Rob. Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. I'm going to provide a brief update on the key balance sheet items and financial measures starting on slide 18. Following the recapture of our living benefit risks and the refinements we made to our risk management strategies in 2016, most of the contract risks and supporting capital for annuities reside in our PALAC statutory entity. Therefore, we view the RBC ratios at Prudential Insurance or PICA and PALAC, as well as the composite RBC shown here, to be important measures of our financial strength. Having said that, recall that we manage our annuity risks using an economic framework that includes holding total assets to a CTE 97 level with the ability to maintain that level through moderate stresses. As a consequence, over time, we may see some variability in the excess of PALAC's RBC over our target ratio. At December 31, 2016 the PICA, PALAC and composite ratios were 457%, 867% and 527% respectively and we estimate that they continue to be well above our target at the end of the first quarter. In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margin ratios of 841% and 967%, respectively, as of December 31. These solvency margin ratios are comfortably above our targets and we estimate that they continue to be so at the end of the first quarter. Looking at the liquidity leverage and capital deployment highlights on slide 19. Cash and highly liquid assets at the parent company amounted to $4 billion at the end of the quarter. The decline of about $600 million from year end was primarily driven by our shareholder distributions exceeding capital inflows from the businesses in the first quarter. I would highlight that distributions received for the businesses are not uniform across all quarters. Recall that the parent company received a $1 billion distribution from PALAC in the fourth quarter of 2016 and historically has received a significant dividend from PICA in the second quarter. During the first quarter, we returned about $640 million to shareholders, including $327 million of dividends and $312 million of share repurchases under the $1.25 billion authorization for the year. And finally, our financial and total leverage ratios declined modestly from year end and remained within our targets as of the end of the first quarter. Now I'll turn it back over to John. John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thank you, Mark. Thank you, Rob. Let's open it up for questions. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger, KBW. Please go ahead. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. I had a question on the Life Planner count. I guess the 8% increase in Japan was pretty significant. Can you give a little bit more color on the dynamic there and as well as your expectations going forward? Charles F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Sure, Ryan. It's Charlie. You're right in your observation that it is a new record count for POJ. And it really has to do with a couple of things actually. One is our concentration on sales managers and creating more sales managers. And obviously when you do that, they then go out and recruit more Life Planners. And sales managers were up about 8% year over year. But there's another initiative that we started last year, which I think is pretty interesting and pretty exciting, and that is that we put a team together to try and attract more women to become Life Planners. And last year, we actually hired 82 women LPs in 2016, which represented about 13% of all recruits. Now, those are really the two main reasons why I think Life Planners have increased and there has been, I think, a higher level of increase than we've seen in the past. So I think in general, the long-term average for POJ has been about 2% to 4%, and we've been a little hotter than that in the past few quarters. But I think as you think about it going forward, probably 2% to 4% is the right number. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then related question was just how much of the sales in Japan in Life Planner this quarter would you characterize as more accelerated ahead of the discount rate reduction versus other products that aren't going to be impacted? Charles F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.: So, POJ sales were up, as was stated earlier, about 41%. And part of that is the fire sale or the accelerated sale in front of the standard discount rate change. But I think part of it also has to do with product mix and it also has to do with the first quarter. So let me go through that. The first quarter is obviously POJ's highest quarter, and that's because of some of the annualized premiums that come in and it's also the end of the qualification period for Life Planners. So POJ always has a strong first quarter. But I think the other reason is you're seeing a shift to U.S. dollar product. So what was so interesting I think about this quarter is, while there was increased activity from the Life Planners as they went out and talked to their clients about potentially purchasing insurance product ahead of the standard rate change in the premium increases, they did that for yen product, but they actually sold proportionally more dollar product. So dollar sales were up 50%, whereas Japanese yen product sales were only up 38%. So, in total, dollar sales were 31% as opposed to 29% a year ago. So I think there was some increase obviously that can be attributed to the fire sale, but the first quarter's always a good quarter for POJ. So I don't have an exact percentage, but if you look back a couple of years, you'll see there is always a slight peak in the first quarter and then it goes down in the second quarter. I think that would be accelerated this time around because you've probably taken some of the second quarter sales that would have occurred in the second quarter and accelerated them to the first quarter. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Got it. Thanks a lot, Charlie. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar, JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. So I had a question first on just the drivers behind weak sales at Gibraltar. I think they were down around 14%. And then relatedly, you'd mentioned increased competition in Japan when speaking about Gibraltar. So wondering if you could just give us details on which product lines or specific channels you're seeing that in. Charles F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Sure. The weak sales in Gibraltar are really entirely attributed to the bank channel. So let me start with that and then I'll come back to the other question. But the full story to explain the bank channel trend really consists of a few contributing factors. First and foremost, as John mentioned, we've always viewed the bank channel as a complementary distribution channel where we're committed to growing profitably. So sales will vary. And we saw that some a few years ago as well. But, as such, following the negative interest rate play or policy in early 2016, we took very swift action to suspend sales of all yen-based single-pay products. And the absence of those single-pay sales this quarter represented roughly a third of the year-over-year decline. So it was a tough comparison year-over-year. Secondly, we're seeing our competitors begin to offer more easily sold recurring-pay products, primarily yen denominated, which has had an impact on the sales in the first quarter. And this is because we primarily sell one yen-based denominated recurring premium product in the bank channel, which is a whole life product that's sold for estate planning purposes and, consequently, requires more time and explanation to be sold. We can do that because of the (35:33) LPs we have there, and so it's a more sophisticated type of sale. And while we understand that our competitors' recurring pay products, the yen products were popular ahead of repricing, we continue to main our discipline around product, profitability and pricing. As an example, we suspended further sales of any three- or five-pay recurring premium whole life product after April 1 because much of that becomes an advance pay. That becomes a single premium product with the advance pay option. And then thirdly, there has been some decline in sales as a result of certain banks enforcing tighter control over the sales process in connection with essentially, a fiduciary duty standard. And this really exerts itself in the form of banks not enforcing month-end sales targets. And so I think you've seen all bank sales across the industry decline slightly. So as a result of this, our bank sales declined by about 32%, but the mix of sales we did also continues to migrate to non-yen sales. So just as I said in the previous question with POJ, U.S. dollar product sales increased this quarter to 83% from 68% a year ago and total non-yen sales which includes Aussie dollar and U.S. dollar increased 90% from 75% a year ago. And this is consistent with what I'd call our kind of simple philosophy, and that is we'd rather sell less more-profitable product than more less-profitable product. And as a result, we feel pretty good about the results in the bank channel this quarter. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, that's helpful detail. And I notice there was a decline in the Life Planner count outside of Japan, I think down about 2% or so from last year. Can you give us some details on which markets drove that? Charles F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yeah. Overall Life Planner count went up. Outside of Japan it went down slightly, but what we've done is we have raised recruiting standards and validation requirements in a number of countries in order to make sure that we're hiring the right people. And so that was particularly in Korea and Taiwan where we did that, and the result was that fewer Life Planners were able to stay on, essentially. And we've hired a few less as the recruiting standards have increased. So that's a case of really protecting the quality of the franchise if you will, and you'll see us do that in all the countries as we continue to raise the bar as we go through. But Brazil still has very good Life Planner count growth and that counteracted some of the decrease in the other countries. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee, Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead. Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC : Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Just looking at Asset Management's profitability, it looks continue to improve, even when I account for the asset \u2013 the AUM growth, there seems to be some margin expansion going on there. Can you maybe talk about at a high level in terms of what you see as the earnings power for Asset Management? And then also maybe comment on the expenses excluding the long-term compensation charge in the quarter. Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Humphrey, it's Steve. I'll address your question by mentioning a couple of points. First of all, in terms of average fee levels, we've been able to maintain those. Even we've seen equity market \u2013 equity outflows, but we've seen substantial inflows in fixed income, in real estate, in our origination businesses, our private debt and mortgage origination businesses, all of which are relatively \u2013 especially certain parts of fixed income where we've been able to attract close \u2013 are relatively higher fee levels. In fact, in real estate, we were able to raise the fees as we mentioned last year on our existing asset base and that's been attractive. Second, kind of taking the next part of the equation in computing margin, a lot of our flows has been into our fixed income business and that is a business where the scale economies of our platform are exceptionally attractive. So all of that really relates to being able to sustain our fee levels, even in the face of pricing pressures across the industry. We're not immune to those pressures, but we've been able to attract flows into categories that have solid fee levels and the margins inherent in our scale economies. In regard to the expenses, we do continue to see expense growth in the business, but that's by design. We're investing in this business significantly. We've been investing both in terms of expanding our investment capabilities and in terms of our distribution platforms. And as you'd expect, those investments are starting to pay off. It kind of stands to reason that the distribution investments start to pay off first and a lot of our flows that we've seen, particularly in fixed income, have come from international markets, in particular Japan, and that's directly attributable to the investments we've made in our global institutional distribution platform. Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC : Appreciate the color. So maybe a question for Charlie. Looking at the life insurance business in Japan, there's definitely a discussion about mortality table change that will affect the pricing. Can you talk about what that may potentially impact Gibraltar or Life Planner's topline and sales growth outlook? Charles F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Sure. Humphrey, let me take that sort of generally. As you said, the new Japan statutory mortality table has been released as an exposure draft. It's expected to go into effect for new business issued after April 1, 2018. At least that's what they're saying at this point. And as expected, life mortality rates are lower than the prior 2007 table. And while this will put some downward pressure on profitability protection products, there are mitigating options such as revisions to expense loading and other things and also lower statutory mortality rates result in lower cash values and statutory reserves, reducing the statutory strain associated with new business. So with the mortality tables, there are going to be ups and downs and we'll just have to wait and see how it plays out. But the good news is we still have some time. So we'll wait and see but we think we'll be able to deal with it. Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Nadel, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey. Good morning. First question, more of a strategic question for you, John. I'm curious about your appetite, if at all, for Group Insurance acquisitions. I ask because while you're a size player, Prudential is a size player in that market, it's clearly not a significant contributor to your overall earnings. And so I'm curious whether you would have an appetite to make the Group Insurance business a bigger contributor of the M&A if the opportunity was available. John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yeah. So John, let me start with a bigger picture response of just how we're thinking about M&A in general, or opportunities in general, and then M&A more particularly. And then I'll turn it over to Steve to speak more specifically to Group. When we think about opportunities, actually our starting point is around organic because organic's cheaper, it's less intrusive and it's also able to be more custom tailored to the specific needs that we're seeing in terms of our customer set. So we continue to think this is a really good time for a strong brand, strong capital position and a leadership team with the skills to both evolve the business in a natural organic way, but also to innovate. And when you look at our track record of converting those kind of opportunities into realities, it's one that inspires confidence in our ability to continue to do that looking forward. Now, when we think about M&A, it's more of a nice to do, not have to do, meaning \u2013 you've heard me say that before, meaning it's not critical to strategic positioning and we're not depending on it to achieve our financial objectives. But nevertheless, it can play an important role in our long-term success. So in the recent past, that's been things like Habitat just in the last 12 months or so. Habitat pension business, the Deutsche Bank investment management business in India, step-up of our ownership in our India life insurance business or, most recently, the Group Insurance business acquisition from Ita\u00fa in Brazil. So there's a not necessarily high profile in each individual case, but in aggregate they're meaningful and strategically they're important in terms of our long-term positioning. Now, that's sort of a construct around both opportunities in general, the role of organic and generally how we're thinking about M&A. Let me turn it over to Steve to speak more specifically to your question on Group. John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thank you, John. John, I'd address the Group perspective as follows : we're certainly aware of and alert to opportunities that may appear from time to time in the space. We are certainly a \u2013 have stronger capabilities to be in acquirer than we did say a few years ago due to the investments we've made in our business platform and the way we've strengthened the business platform and we have an interest to grow. We see the Group business as an attractive one, both in its own right and as a highly effective client acquisition model for relationships that we can deepen and individualize across our businesses. At the same time, I'd pick up on some of the themes that John just mentioned. We have good momentum in organic growth in the business and we're mindful of continuing that and that's really what our priority is. And I'd also say that some of the things that have taken place in the group market recently have done so at fairly full valuation shall we say and so while we're alert to opportunities that appear, we're going to be disciplined and measured in the way we approach our own valuation of those opportunities. John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Very, very much appreciate that last comment especially. And then I have a follow-up for Mark on the regulatory side. Any insight yet, Mark, into what's likely to come out of the review of FSOC's designation process, especially as it relates to SIFI insurance companies? And if ultimately your SIFI designation was rescinded, how does that impact your G-SII designation? Is that automatically rescinded as well since you're not deemed systemic by your home regulator? How does that work? Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Right. On the current outlook, we've expressed optimism about the general tone of the discussion in Washington around regulation, and more specifically, around SIFI designation. And I think it's challenging to predict specific outcomes, but we continue to believe that as time passes and as either processes or specific designations are reviewed, we expect that ultimately we may not wind up as a SIFI. Exactly how we get there, I'm not quite sure. So it's work in process. It's an uncertain environment, but we think the tone of things is moving in the right direction in terms of the regulatory burden, and the consideration of non-bank SIFIs in particular. With respect to G-SII designation, the two don't go hand in hand. And having our domestic designation rescinded would not result in necessarily the removal of the G-SII designation. That comes from the FSB, the Financial Stability Board. And there have been circumstances where there are differences between being domestically significant and internationally significant. So that's not in the cards. Those things won't necessarily move together. Having said that, though, remember that there is no mechanism currently to directly implement any standards as it relates to our G-SII designation. Right now, that process would depend on Federal Reserve supervision. As New Jersey plays a role as a group supervisor, we'll see how they deal with the international aspects of questions and issues related to supervision. So that's out there as a channel, or mechanism, for enforcing G-SII standards, but I'd say we're not quite there yet. John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Understood. So New Jersey could play the Federal Reserve role potentially? Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yes. They are currently a group supervisor of ours. John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question then comes from the line of Suneet Kamath, Citi. Please go ahead. Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to start on slide six of your earnings deck on the Annuity business. If I look at the mix of annuities HDI retained by PRU, that percentage of your total has gone up year-over-year. And I guess two questions related to that. What are the impacts that that reinsurance arrangement is now expired? And then, second, is another reason just DOL and the fact that advisors are now more focused on living benefit types of products? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Suneet, this is Steve. I'll address your question as follows. I think that in terms of the change of mix, you're looking at a couple of different things. First of all, yes, the reinsurance arrangement with Union Hamilton did expire. They informed us and other counterparties that they've reached capacity for this line of business. And I think that another contributing factor is the decline in PDI sales that Mark referenced in his opening comments. PDI is sensitive to pricing changes. As we've discussed before, we have a unique capability across the industry to reprice monthly from new sales in several of our product lines, including PDI. Twice last year, in the face of a very low interest rate environment, we took down the PDI benefit and we saw impact of sales in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter. So that was a driver of what you're pointing to. I will mention, though, that we did take the benefit back up in February. Market conditions and higher interest rates permitted us to do that while still writing business at target returns. So we have seen a pick-up in PDI sales momentum over the last month of the quarter. Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then maybe just shifting to Retirement, and specifically PRT. Has there been any change in either, I'll call it the supply or capacity to do PRT transactions by the industry, or demand on the part of plan sponsors to execute such a transaction, given where we are with interest rates? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yeah. First off, in terms of the competitive environment, there are several competitors in the space. Some of them are sharpening their appetite. So we see capacity, at a minimum, holding steady, if not increasing. So that's been the case for some time now and that trend continues. In regard to the pipeline, we see a very robust pipeline. The rate environment is at a sweet spot right now in that regard. There's been a pick-up in rates from last year and that's improved plan funding levels, and so that certainly strengthens the ability of plan sponsors to transact. At the same time, though, most plan sponsors don't seem to anticipate near-term rapid further increases in rates, so their propensity to transact still remains strong. And, of course, there are other contributing factors to that propensity to transact, like rising PBGC premiums and heightened awareness of longevity risk. So the business will remain episodic, but we see the pipeline as being very solid. Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And with that increase in supply by insurance companies, is that creating any pricing pressures in terms of these competitive dynamics? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: The business is a price competitive one. And at the same time, though, our focus in the midsize to large cases really continues to work for us. It's an area where, while there's certainly a need to be price competitive, we see that the competition takes place across a number of dimensions, including strength of the value proposition, including our certainty of close and our very effective process for shepherding a transaction to closing. Large case market also gives us very robust information and census data that enables us to fully deploy our underwriting skills. And, in particular, the large case market also involves assets in kind rather than being a cash market, as the smaller end of the market is. Those assets in kind and our ability to take those over and redeploy them really plays to our asset management skills. So for all those reasons, while we're not absent from all spectrums of the market, we, relatively speaking, write less in the small end that is all about price competition and write more in the larger segments of the market where some of these value-added dimensions can come into play. Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our last question is from the line of Tom Gallagher, Evercore. Please go ahead. Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC : Thanks. Hey, Charlie, I just wanted to circle back on Japan. So I get your comments on the changes in pricing on some of the end products, but you've had very good momentum for your U.S. dollar and Aussie dollar products for a while here. Can you provide a little perspective on what's been happening there? Are those high-margin products, well above yen? What is competition like in that end of the market and do you think you can sustain pretty good sales momentum for the foreign currency products? Charles F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yeah. So let me make a couple of comments in general and then I'll come back to kind of competition. So looking at our Japan business, much of what we sell, in fact two-thirds of what we sell is protection. And so we are in a segment of the market right off the top that many other people either aren't in or kind of shy away from. And that's because of the strength of our distribution model. So two-thirds of our business or three-quarters of our business comes from what I'd call our tied agency system, and only about a third comes from third-party distribution. So we're able to sell protection products because of the sophistication of our Life Planners and Life Plan consultants. The second point I'd make is that most of our product, over 90% of our product is recurring premium product, and the rest is almost all fixed annuities or annuities that re-price every two weeks. So again, we sell a more sophisticated product. And then on top of that, we're able to sell U.S. dollar product. And that's really I think one of the competitive advantages that you see that we've had and we continue to have as we shift our business mix to U.S. dollar product, which is by \u2013 I will say by definition. It's not by definition, but is more profitable than yen product. So yen product we're selling, it's within our target range. Quite frankly, before the re-pricing, it was probably at the lower end of our target range. But the dollar product is at the high end of our target range. And we look at the business mix of all that together and it's \u2013 that is what produces the momentum and the profitability of our franchise. Now in terms of competition, we haven't seen much competition in our captive channels for U.S. dollar product, nor in the IA channel. That's partly because of the nature of what we sell, which I said was death protection, and it's partly due to the way in which we sell it, through needs-based selling through the sophistication of our Life Planners and Life Plan consultants. We have seen some increased competition in the bank channel but, frankly, not as much as we might've expected. So there is some there, but we have seen \u2013 we haven't seen as much as we might've thought we would. So again, I think we're in a fairly reasonable place in terms of the momentum we have and the way in which we're conducting our business. Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC : And so the foreign currency products you're selling are mainly protection? I would've thought a lot of that would've been driven by the spread on interest rates and more for the investment orientation of the product. Charles F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.: No. Again, if you think, two thirds of what we sell is protection product. That's the basis of our franchise. And so there is some investment component in some of the product, but most of it, you think about the amount of mortality and expense margin that we have from our protection products. We rely much more on that than we do on spread margin. Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. And then just my final question. Just curious, I think you've been asked this before, just on economic solvency in Japan and whether you guys would provide an estimate of what that ratio would be for you, or just some perspective on the way you view your solvency under SMR. And then more under some economic framework and whether it gets better or worse when you think about change, ultimate change in where the regulatory environment may go. Robert M. Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Hey, Tom. It's Rob. Let me try to take a stab at that. So as you're alluding to, the JFSA is working on developing a more economically sensitive solvency regime to either evolve or complement the SRM regime that's currently in place. It's important. This is a long-term project, Tom. Development of any replacement is going to be something that's going to be beyond even what the IAIS is talking about. So think about it as being beyond a 2020 sort of a timetable. They have conducted field tests. We've participated in those. The field tests were modeled after some of the things that were being done by the IAIS. Importantly, what came out of those field tests, we think that the lesson that came out of that for the JFSA was that it pointed to the inherent flaws in some of the constructs that are being floated, particularly as it applies to life companies and life companies that are selling long-duration life products like the Japanese insurers. So when you see the composite ratios that were released from that, it sort of indicates that it didn't work very well for the Japanese companies and that's \u2013 wasn't a surprise to us and I think it was helpful in terms of an education process for the regulators. With respect to us, our Japan business is extremely well-capitalized. We see this in our existing solvency margin ratios and we see it in our own internal economic ratios. So we have, and always have, and will continue to manage our business with an economic lens and hold capital to the higher of whatever is required from either a statutory or an economic standpoint. We would expect this to be evident in any appropriate solvency regime that the FSA might develop over the next course of the next several years. And to answer the question that you didn't ask but I'm sure was the intent of your question, we don't expect our capital redeployment in Japan to be in any way affected by the evolution of the solvency margin regime in Japan and have no intents at this point to change our philosophy or distribution targets. Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Rob.

And with that, I will hand it over to John. John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will provide higher-level observations on the quarter, the core fundamental trends in our businesses and capital deployment, and then hand it over to Mark and Rob to cover the specifics. We had a few moving parts that impacted reported results in the quarter. Looking through those items, one can see that we reported strong results. Second quarter adjusted operating income, excluding market-driven and discrete items of $2.93 per share, was well above the prior year of $2.46 per share. The annualized ROE for the quarter on the same basis was over 14%, exceeding our near-to-intermediate term objective of 12% to 13%. Results for the quarter reflect the benefits from positive net flows and favorable equity markets in our fee-based businesses, top line growth in our International businesses and overall strong margins. While results for the quarter were better than we would ordinarily expect partly due to items that were inherently variable, we are pleased with our overall operating earnings trends. We did experience some volatility in our reported results in the quarter. Reported adjusted operating income of $2.09 per share and net income of $1.12 per share were adversely impacted by adjustments taken as a result of our annual review of actuarial assumptions and other reserve refinements. These adjustments primarily affected our Individual Life business. To put this in context, over the last few years, we've undergone a process of upgrading our systems across our Domestic businesses. This has enabled us to model our data at a more granular level and create efficiencies in our businesses. As you migrate to enhanced systems, there can be impact to reserve balances due to calculation differences as well as revisions to estimates facilitated by these enhanced capabilities. And these items comprise the majority of the impact to the quarter. Updates to our underlying policyholder behavior and capital markets assumptions overall had a relatively modest impact on our results. In addition to the annual review of actuarial assumptions, net income in the quarter was impacted by mark-to-market losses in our variable annuity businesses, due mainly to items we view as non-economic, and, therefore, don't hedge, as Mark will discuss. Overall, you can look through these significant items and see that the earnings power, cash generation and capital position of our combined businesses all remain in a very strong position, largely unaffected by the volatility we experienced in the quarter. I will now touch on key fundamental trends in our businesses, starting with our Domestic businesses. We reported very good earnings in our Individual Annuities business, driven by record account values and exceptionally strong margins. We continue to benefit from the actions we took in 2016 to more effectively and efficiently manage the product guarantees in our variable annuity business. The particularly strong return on assets in the quarter of 127 basis points exceeds our run rate expectation for the business, which continues to generate very good core margins and earnings and represents a strong source of cash flow to the holding company. Retirement core earnings were also strong benefiting from record account values, another quarter of favorable case experience in our pension risk transfer business and better than expected investment performance. Results have continued to trend modestly above our internal expectations, even after adjusting for the favorable items we call out. Having said that, Retirement's earnings power is very good and we remain optimistic on the long-term growth and earnings characteristics of this business. Net flows were negative in the quarter, largely reflecting the quarterly lumpiness that we observe in this business. Nevertheless, we are pleased with the $1.6 billion funded pension risk transfer case we closed in the quarter, and have onboarded a $5.7 billion defined contribution plan that we closed early in the third quarter. Our Asset Management business, or PGIM, had another outstanding result, generating solid earnings and outstanding net flows of $7.7 billion for the quarter. Total assets under management of $1.1 trillion and unaffiliated third-party assets under management of $565 billion were both records. PGIM continues to benefit from strong investment performance, and the pipeline for new mandates remains robust. Results from our U.S. protection businesses were mixed. It was clearly a challenging quarter for our Individual Life Insurance business. Notably, results reflect a lowered expectation of earnings due to the ongoing impact from the annual actuarial assumption review. However, our Group Insurance business delivered very strong earnings, driven by a benefit ratio that was the lowest in recent memory. It was a nice bounce-back quarter for Group Insurance after seasonally lighter first quarter results, and our underwriting trends continue to perform very well. I will now turn to our International businesses, which had one of its strongest core earnings quarters on record and generated 14% growth in constant currency sales. The quarter benefited from stable growth, better-than-expected underwriting margins, and other areas of favorability. Life Planner constant currency sales increased 23% over the prior year, which reflects the continued impact from a sales surge related to the repricing of yen-based products in Japan. Gibraltar sales increased 8% over the prior year on a constant currency basis, benefiting from the same sales dynamic. While the acceleration in sales produced strong growth in our yen products at both Life Planner and Gibraltar, I would highlight that growth in our U.S. dollar products in Japan increased 18% over the prior year and comprised over 50% of our Japan sales. Shifting to capital deployment, we returned approximately $640 million of capital to shareholders in the quarter, about equally split between dividends and buybacks. We have a robust capital position and generate considerable free cash flow, which enable us to return healthy amounts of capital to shareholders while continuing to invest in our businesses for long-term growth. On that note, we recently announced a realignment of our U.S. businesses that will better position us to leverage our business mix to capture long-term growth opportunities within and across our Domestic businesses. As we communicated at our June Investor Day, we believe that our unique capabilities, customer base, and culture of innovation and collaboration put us in an enviable position to deliver needed products to customers at attractive returns to our shareholders. And with that, I'll hand it over to Mark. Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thank you, John. Good morning, good afternoon or good evening. Thank you for joining our call today. I'll take you through our results, and then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon, who will cover liquidity, leverage and capital highlights. I'll start on slide 2. After-tax adjusted operating income amounted to $2.09 per share for the quarter compared to $1.84 a year ago. After adjusting for $0.84 per share of market-driven and discrete items, which I will discuss momentarily, EPS amounted to $2.93 for the quarter, up from $2.46 a year ago, as the core performance of our businesses overall was strong in the quarter. Looking across our businesses, I'll mention a few highlights of results compared to a year ago. First, fees from our Individual Annuities and Asset Management businesses increased by about $160 million, reflecting market appreciation and positive flows. We also benefited from refinements to our annuities risk management strategy, which was implemented last year. Second, continued business growth in our International Insurance business on a constant currency basis. Third, a lower loss from Corporate & Other operations, driven by favorable fluctuations in expenses and investment income. These benefits were partially offset by higher expenses in several of our businesses. In addition, current quarter results also included a few inherently variable items. We experienced $80 million of favorable net underwriting results as compared to our average expectations. Non-coupon investment returns and prepayment income were about $55 million above our average expectations. And we incurred higher-than-typical expenses in our Life Planner business of about $25 million. These variable items had a net positive impact on current quarter results of about $0.16 per share. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items, our EPS of $5.69 for the first half of 2017 implies an ROE of 14.4% on an annualized basis. On a GAAP basis, including amounts categorized as realized investment gains or losses and results from divested businesses, we reported net income of $491 million for the current quarter, or $1.12 per share, about $400 million below our after-tax adjusted operating income. This difference was mainly driven by a negative impact from product derivatives, which I will discuss shortly. Moving to slide 3. This year's actuarial review, including reserve updates and refinements for our ongoing businesses, resulted in a net unfavorable pre-tax impact of $492 million, including a net charge of $622 million to AOI, partially offset by a net benefit of $130 million outside of AOI. The annual updates to insurance assumptions were generally modest across our businesses with the exception of Individual Life, where the updates aggregated to a net charge of $560 million. This charge is driven by the following items. During the quarter, we completed an upgrade of an Individual Life valuation system. This resulted in an increase in reserves from a refinement in the calculation of estimated mortality claims. In addition, our Individual Life systems upgrades provided enhanced cash flow estimates that enabled us to revise our reinsurance accounting methodology, which accelerated the recognition of reinsurance expense. These two items accounted for most of the Individual Life charge in the quarter, with the remainder due to other factors including modestly lower lapse experience in our Guaranteed Universal Life block. The overall impact of the changes in policyholder behavior and capital market assumption was largely offsetting across our businesses. I would highlight that this year's review of economic assumptions included a reduction in expected long-term fixed income returns. While returns vary by duration, we reduced our long-term expectation of the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate by 25 basis points, and now grade to 3.75% over 10 years. In Japan, we reduced the long-term expected return by 40 basis points on Japanese government bonds and now grade to 1.5% over 10 years. Our expected long-term U.S. equity returns remain largely unchanged. As John mentioned, the annual actual update had a largely inconsequential impact on future earnings as the favorable effects on our Annuities and Retirement businesses mostly offset the unfavorable effect on our Individual Life business. And our view of capital capacity was also largely unaffected. Turning to slide 4. Aside from the annual review of actuarial assumptions, the additional market-driven and discrete item for the current quarter consists of our quarterly market and experience unlockings in the annuity business. These favorable unlockings were mainly driven by performance of equities in our customer accounts and resulted in a net benefit of $0.08 per share. Moving to slide 5. Our GAAP net income of $491 million in the current quarter includes amounts characterized as pre-tax net realized investment losses of $679 million and divested business results and other items outside of adjusted operating income, amounting to a net pre-tax gain of $73 million. Of note, product-related derivatives and hedging had a negative impact of $961 million, largely due to the impact of applying our tighter credit spread to the gross GAAP liability balance for variable annuity living benefits. The gain from the general investment portfolio and related activities are driven by pre-tax gains in our International Insurance investment portfolios. Moving to our business results and starting on slide 6. I'll discuss the comparative results, excluding the market-driven and discrete items that I mentioned earlier. Annuities earnings were $512 million for the quarter, up by $137 million from a year ago. The increase was driven by a greater contribution from policy charges and fee income, primarily a result of a 6% increase in our variable annuity average separate account values. They were driven by the benefit from our retirement and risk management strategy for product guarantees implemented in 2016, and by the favorable impacts of the annual actuarial review. Also contributing to the growth in earnings were more favorable net investment results from higher invested asset balances and current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees about $5 million above our average expectations compared to results modestly below expectations a year ago. The return on assets, or ROA, of 127 basis points reflects the items I just mentioned and is well above recent trends. While we believe that some of the ROA improvement is sustainable, including the impact of the annual actuarial review, we do not expect to be able to maintain this elevated level as a baseline in the future. Slide 7 presents our annuity sales. Total gross sales of $1.5 billion in the quarter are down by $800 million from a year ago and up by $100 million from the prior quarter. This trend in gross sales reflects the actions we have taken to reprice our PDI product as well as broader industry sales pressure we believe partly in response to the DOL Fiduciary rule, which was partially effective in June and is expected to be fully implemented in January of 2018. Turning to slide 8. Retirement earnings were $328 million for the quarter, up by $98 million from a year ago. The increase was driven by a greater contribution from net investment results and by more favorable case experience. The contribution from net investment results was up $72 million from a year ago. Current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees were about $25 million above our average expectations, compared to a contribution about $30 million below expectations a year ago. A 5% increase in average spread-based account values also contributed to stronger net investment results. Current quarter case experience was about $30 million more favorable than our average expectations primarily from our pension risk transfer business, which continues to perform very well. This compares to about $20 million more favorable experience a year ago. Turning to slide 9. Total Retirement gross deposits and sales were $7.8 billion for the current quarter compared to $8.1 billion a year ago. The decrease was driven by lower institutional investment product sales in the current quarter, as prior year sales included two longevity reinsurance cases totaling about $2 billion, while the current quarter included a $1.6 billion funded pension risk transfer case. Total Retirement account values were a record at $401.3 billion, up by 7% from a year earlier. This includes the benefit from market appreciation as well as about $2 billion of positive net flows over the past year. The net outflows in the quarter reflect the episodic nature of the large case business, inherent in both full-service and Institutional Investment products, as well as the impact of the normal runoff of group annuity and longevity reinsurance cases. In particular, we experienced an elevated level of net outflows in our investment-only stable value business this quarter. Turning to slide 10. Asset Management earnings were $218 million for the quarter compared to $207 million a year ago. The increase was driven by higher Asset Management fees, partially offset by higher expenses. The increase in Asset Management fees is driven by the 7% growth in assets under management and from the benefit of a fee rate restructuring in real estate in the third quarter of last year. Asset Management reported $7.7 billion of net unaffiliated third-party flows in the quarter, excluding money market activity, with contributions from the Institutional and Retail businesses, each driven by strong fixed income flows. Turning to slide 11. Individual Life earnings were $96 million for the quarter, compared to $130 million a year ago. The decrease was driven by lower underwriting results and higher expenses, partially offset by a greater contribution from net investment results. The lower net contribution from underwriting was driven by the impact of the annual actuarial review and other refinements on current quarter results, partially offset by more favorable claims experience. Earnings for the current quarter reflected claims experience that was about $10 million below our average expectations, compared to claims experience about $20 million below our average expectations a year ago. The higher contribution from net investment results included income from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, essentially consistent with our average expectations and compared to returns about $5 million below our average expectations a year ago. Turning to slide 12. Individual Life sales, based on annualized new business premiums, were down $6 million or 4% from a year ago. Guaranteed Universal Life sales were down 34% from a year ago, reflecting the impact of price increases and face amount limits in the second half of last year and the migration to our principles-based reserve compliant version of this product launched in March of this year. Partially offsetting that were other Universal Life sales, which increased by $10 million from the prior year, driven by large case estate planning sales and term product sales, which increased due to pricing actions. Turning to slide 13. Group Insurance earnings were $81 million for the quarter, up by $33 million from a year ago. The increase came mainly from more favorable underwriting results and a greater contribution from net investment results. Group Insurance benefits ratio of 84.5% was well below the low end of our targeted range of 87% to 91%, driven by favorable Group Life incidents, which produced about $30 million of favorable earnings as compared to our expected range. Moving to International Insurance and turning to slide 14. Earnings for our Life Planner business were $396 million for the quarter, compared to $381 million a year ago. Excluding a $9 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, earnings increased by $24 million from a year ago. The increase was driven by continued business growth with constant dollar insurance revenues up 7% from a year ago, more favorable policy benefits experience and a greater contribution from investment results, partially offset by higher net expenses. The more favorable policy benefit experience included current quarter claims experience which was about $20 million more favorable than our average expectations, compared to about $10 million more favorable a year ago. The higher contribution from net investment results included current quarter returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, about $10 million above our average expectations and compared to returns, only slightly above our average expectations a year ago. In addition, the current quarter also included about $25 million of higher than typical net expenses, including true-ups to legal reserves and deferred acquisition costs. Turning to slide 15. Gibraltar Life earnings were $473 million for the quarter, compared to $494 million a year ago. Excluding an $8 million negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates, earnings decreased by $13 million from a year ago. The decrease reflects higher net expenses and a lower contribution from net investment results, partially offset by more favorable policy benefits experience and business growth. The higher net expenses in the current quarter are driven by the absence of about $40 million of income recognized from a sale of a home office property that was part of the acquisition of Star and Edison in the year ago quarter. The lower contribution from net investment results includes current quarter returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, about $15 million above our average expectations, compared to returns about $35 million above expectations a year ago. The more favorable policy benefit experience includes claims experience, which was about $10 million more favorable than our average expectations in the current quarter. Benefit experience was essentially consistent with our expectations a year ago. In addition, a concentration of annual mode revenues favors second quarter results. We would estimate that the benefit to current quarter earnings was about $25 million. Turning to slide 16. International Insurance sales on a constant dollar basis were $835 million for the current quarter, up by $101 million, or 14%, from a year ago, driven by higher sales in Japan. Life Planner sales in Japan were up by 35% from a year ago, reflecting primarily an elevated level of sales associated with rate increases due to the standard discount rate change on yen-based products effective April 1. Also contributing to the sales increase was a 6% increase in the Life Planner count in Japan. Gibraltar sales were up by 8% from a year ago, also driven by a sales surge ahead of premium increases on yen-based products, as well as the introduction of a low cash value U.S. dollar whole life product with nursing care benefits, partially offset by a modest decline in bank channel sales. A little over half of our sales in Japan in the quarter were from U.S. dollar products despite higher yen-based sales. Turning to slide 17. The Corporate & Other loss was $308 million for the current quarter, compared to a $376 million loss a year ago. The main drivers of the variants are lower expenses, including such items as fixed asset disposals, legal costs, and other expenses which can fluctuate, and higher investment income, including the absence of a $40 million charge in the prior year from a decline in value of a tax-advantaged investment that we account for under the equity method. We also recognized higher income from our pension plan, following our assumption update at year-end, and lower interest expense from our paydowns of debt last year. Now, I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon. Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. I'm going to provide an update on key balance sheet items and financial measures and I'll be brief. Following the recapture of our living benefit risks and the refinements we made to our risk management strategies in 2016, we view the RBC ratios at Prudential Insurance, or PICA, and PALAC, as well as the composite RBC shown here to be important measures of our financial strength. Having said that, as we have highlighted previously, we manage our annuity risks using an economic framework that includes holding capital, holding total assets to a CTE 97 level, with the ability to maintain that level through moderate stresses. As a consequence, over time, we may see some variability in the excess of PALAC's RBC over our targeted ratio. At December 31, 2016, the PICA, PALAC, and composite ratios were well above our target, and we estimate that they continue to be so at the end of the second quarter. In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margin ratios of 879% and 893%, respectively, as of March 31, their fiscal year-end. The solvency margin ratios are comfortably above our targets, and we estimate that they continue to be so at the end of the second quarter. Looking at the liquidity, leverage, and capital deployment highlights on slide 19. Highly liquid assets at the parent company amounted to $3.7 billion at the end of the quarter. While this represents a decline of about $300 million sequentially, cash balances at the parent company will fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to the timing of subsidiary dividends and holding company commitments. During the second quarter, we returned about $640 million to shareholders, including $320 million of dividends and $313 million of share repurchases, under the $1.25 billion authorization for the year. And finally, our financial leverage and total leverage ratios were within our targets as of the end of the second quarter. Now I'll turn it back over to John. John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thank you, Rob. Thank you, Mark. Now we'd like to open it up for questions. Operator : Our first question today comes from the line of Seth Weiss with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, good morning. If I could start with a question on annuities, you commented that the 127 basis point ROA is exceeding your run rate expectations. Could you classify what do you think is a more sustainable level and then help us map the difference between that level and the 105 basis point run rate we've seen the last couple of years? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Seth, it's Steve Pelletier. I'll start by offering some comments on that score and I think Rob can follow up. The elevated ROA level reflects a number of factors. In particular, as Mark touched upon, favorable market conditions and the ongoing impact of our annual assumption updates and how that interacts with our risk management strategy. Those factors were significant drivers. And that contributed about 13 basis points of ROA compared to the first quarter. Some of this list is sustainable, but we aren't necessarily expecting to maintain the full increase going forward. There was some favorability in the quarter on our hedging costs and other factors, and we're always assessing ways of managing the risk to create the best possible economic outcomes across multiple scenarios. With that said, we think the block is very well-capitalized, well-managed, and generates very considerable free cash flow. So we would kind of update our thoughts about long-term sustainable ROA to the 110 to 115 basis points range over the long run, with meaningful upside to that in the near term. Rob? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Maybe just pick up where Steve left off, which is just to reiterate that our annuities book is performing really strongly and we're quite happy with it. Earnings are up significantly, as is free cash flow. It's well-capitalized and our capitalization strengthened further during the course of the quarter. And volatility remains quite low. So, the ROA that you saw in the current quarter is about \u2013 call it 125 basis points on kind of a run rate basis. It's about 15 basis points above the guidance that Steve has provided before, which was 105 to 110 in terms of what we thought was sustainable. We believe the sustainable rate in the long term is probably, as Steve mentioned, in that 110 to 115 range, though recognize that it's likely it will trend higher than that in the more immediate and intermediate term. There are three things to keep in mind. First, we're benefiting from some positive hedge breakage and that's factored into that 125 basis points. And in the long term, we don't believe that's sustainable, we think that sort of nets out to zero, and so there will probably be some reversion on that over the course of time. Secondly, recall that fee levels in our annuities business are likely to compress for two reasons. One, we've undertaken a product diversification strategy and the fees relevant to AUM and some of the newer products are lower than they were in our HD product. And secondly, as the book matures, we have step-downs in our scheduled fees, and so we'll see some impact from that over the course of time as well. And the third is the item that Steve alluded to, which is with respect to our hedge strategy. We are likely to look at hedging tactics as we go forward. Recall that we manage, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, this block to a CTE 97 level, with the ability to withstand that level through cyclical or moderate stresses. But as we've previously said, we continually reevaluate our hedging strategy in order to optimize the balance between cash instruments we use and derivative instruments to manage the risk balancing between earnings, liquidity, capital flexibility, and volatility. Given the recent run-up in the markets and some of the benefits that we're seeing from our assumption updates, this is a good opportunity for us to revisit that strategy, evaluating the tradeoffs between our increased ROAs and the ability to further decrease volatility and increase our flexibility with respect to distributable earnings and capital. I'll reiterate, it's fair to say that we will likely trend above our view of that sustainable level in the near term, but we think that's how we would guide you to think about this business in the long-term. Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : That's incredibly helpful. Thank you very much. And then just a quick one on the actuarial review. The system updates that you refer to have not an inconsequential impact on book value. Are there any more system updates coming forward that we should be aware of? Or have you mostly made your way through all these conversions? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: So, let me, if you don't mind, Seth, answer that perhaps a little more broadly and then come back and answer your very specific question. We are highly sensitive to the non-economic outcomes that have been created by virtue of the systems enhancements and the disconnect that that creates between our operating income and our reported GAAP income. And while we would portray those things as not really reflective of any change in the underlying economics, we recognize that to the extent that we have that disconnect, that creates noise in the marketplace, can have an impact on our share price. And if it has an impact on our share price, it is, by definition, economics, and so we care about it. We've taken a lot of actions and we've been investing in systems in order to address that disconnect that we've seen in the past by reducing complexity and reducing earnings volatility. You've seen the payoffs from this in a number of places already. So, we did the Closed Block restructuring a number of years ago, we did our division restructuring in Japan which mitigated the FX remeasurement volatility we had been seeing in the past. We've significantly reduced our duration management swaps by some 60% or so, and implemented derivative hedge accounting wherever it was permissible. And then most recently, we did the VA captive recapture and the restructuring, and along with that, we eliminated the corporate interest rate under-hedge. All of those things took a substantial amount of volatility out of our financial statements. We've also been going through this multi-year series of significant actuarial systems enhancements to sort of get back to your very specific question. They have facilitated, as John indicated in opening remarks, a more sophisticated and granular capability for modeling. Over time, this enhanced capability leads to better modeling and less reliance on estimates and approximations, and that we expect will then produce less volatility prospectively. However, the initial process of implementing the systems can generate greater interim volatility as we migrate from old platforms and models to the newer ones. And that's what you've seen in Life this quarter. Now, the good news is that we have substantially completed the upgrades to our most significant actuarial valuation systems. Evidence of this, you can see in the results from our Annuities business, where volatility has declined significantly as it was one of the earlier businesses to go through the systems and model enhancements that we've been undertaking. Life is now at the tail-end of that, as well, and our other businesses have that largely behind them. So, while we will still be subject to changes in experience, which can give rise to actuarial assumption updates, we would expect the refinements components of our 2Q updates that are driven by model updates and enhancements to be more muted on a go-forward basis. We expect these and other actions that we've taken over time will result in a more clear and consistent representation of economics of our business model in our reported financial results. I apologize for the tangent, Seth, but I thought it was important that you and others understand that we continue to be sensitive to this and we wanted to address it and let you know that we're still very engaged and focused on this. Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Very helpful. Thanks a lot. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Erik Bass - Autonomous Research : Hi, thank you. I was hoping you could provide more detail on the implications of the Individual Life assumption changes for the overall profitability of the block and the go-forward operating earnings. And then, assuming there is a reduction in earnings, and is that more a function of timing in terms of recognizing reinsurance expense or lower assumed future profitability? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: So, Erik, let me take a stab at that and then Steve may want to jump in as well. So, if you \u2013 you should think about the updates that we've made during the course of the second quarter, on an after-tax AOI basis, it aggregates, call it around $420 million. It had three principal components to it. As John mentioned in his opening remarks, the first two relate to refinements in modeling and changes in accounting methods for the mortality on the Hartford block and for reinsurance on all of our GUL and VUL. Together, those two components account for about 75% of the charge. The result is a change in a pattern of future earnings, which will result in a level of lower \u2013 a level of earnings in the near-term, low level of earnings in the near-term that will be offset by a higher level of earnings further out. What I would emphasize is that there is no statutory impact, no capital impact, or no cash impact from this. Neither reflects a change in our view of the underlying economics, either. So, and then generally, those updates, as I described to my answer to Seth, were really enabled by the system enhancements, which allowed much more refined modeling. And also important to note, with respect to the Hartford component of this, recall that a year ago we adopted this PFL, profits followed by losses accounting, and that tends to very much magnify small changes. So, you have relatively small changes on a large block, then magnified by PFL accounting, resulting in some of the larger change that you've seen. The remaining piece of the $420 million after-tax, so, is about 25%. It does reflect a change in actuarial assumptions, primarily lapse rates. This is a change in underlying economics, and it affected both GAAP and stat. The statutory impact was offset by other positive things that happened in stat during the course of the quarter. So, to directly answer your question, on a combined basis, if you take all of this and you look at both the updates and the refinements and how it manifested itself in the period run rate of AOI for Life, it's about $40 million lower than what we've seen in previous quarters, on a pre-tax basis. Now, that's largely offset by the run rates that we've seen in our other businesses, the increases there. But we would suggest that that's the appropriate way to think about the earnings run rate for the business going forward and we think, as a result of these changes, those earnings now bear a much closer relationship to the economics that underlie that business as well. Erik Bass - Autonomous Research : Got it. Thank you. Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Erik, it's Steve. Just to amplify one note on what Rob said, we don't usually talk about business unit returns, but I think for purposes of this quarter and your question, it's useful to do so. Even as we absorb the impact that Rob mentioned in terms of our run rate earnings in the Individual Life business, we still see returns in the range of 10% on an unlevered basis, which we consider to be quite respectable in the current environment. Erik Bass - Autonomous Research : Thank you. That's very helpful. And I guess, thinking about it, based on that sort of expected run rate, it looks like Individual Life earnings are kind of back to the level where they were sort of prior to the Hartford acquisition, and obviously, there have been moving parts in terms of interest rates and other factors that affect earnings. I guess, how should we think about the contributions of that acquisition? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: I think, Erik, again, we'd see the Hartford acquisition as still a very attractive step forward for the business. It generated meaningful scale economies and expense synergies. It very considerably strengthened our return, our distribution footprint, and our ability to cover really all the relevant distribution channels in the business. And again, we would characterize returns, unlevered IRRs in the 10% range on the acquisition. Modestly lower than we might have expressed a couple of years ago or a few years ago, due largely to interest rate environment \u2013 movements in the interest rate environment since the acquisition, and to certain experiences around lapsation in certain products, but still an acquisition that we're glad we made. Erik Bass - Autonomous Research : Great. Thank you for the comment. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of John Nadel with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, good morning, everybody. I was hoping maybe, Rob, you could elaborate a little bit more. A couple of times here, I guess on this call, you've really talked about or expressed very favorable free cash flow dynamics associated with the annuity block. And I was just wondering, at least relative to your overall free cash flow expectations for the corporation, how does the annuity block look today? And I assume it looks better than it did even a couple of quarters ago, given some of the increase in earnings here. Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: So, John, I think that's sort of appropriate conclusion for you to reach. So, one, the level of earnings is up significantly. Two, as a result of both assumption updates and the sales environment that we find ourselves in, the business is throwing off a tremendous amount of cash. And so, at this point in time, the cash coming from the annuities business would be very accretive to the overall target that we have of 60% of free cash flow relative to our adjusted operating income. John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you. That's all I have. Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: The sales reference, by the way, is to the fact that lower sales means higher cash flow. John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yes, I understand. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI : Good morning. Just another question on the review, Rob. You mentioned a 40 basis point reduction in assumed JGB yields, I guess that's a large percentage change. Just curious if that had any impact. It doesn't appear to have any impacts on the balance sheet or future earnings associated with that, but I'm guessing, if you bake that into EGPs that would \u2013 that could be meaningful from a future earnings standpoint. So, just trying to reconcile how to think about that. Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yeah, Tom. So, in the International businesses on a combined basis, as a result of taking that long-term reversion rate down, you saw a pre-tax charge of about $50 million between the businesses. Now, what I will say is that it was more prevalent in POJ than it was in Gibraltar. Gibraltar had \u2013 one, it's a shorter duration book than POJ is, but two, Gibraltar also had some offsets in other areas. So, when you actually look through the numbers, you won't see the Gibraltar charge, you'll see it a little bit more clearly in POJ. So, yeah, on a percentage basis, a relatively large charge, but not a particularly large charge given the size of those books. Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI : I guess I'm more curious about future earnings and the way to think about profitability of the block. If you're taking that future yield on new money assumption down by that much, I would imagine it would have a negative impact. Is the reason that you wouldn't have a change in DAC amortization because you have more FAS 60 business where it's not an EGP construct or I just want to \u2013 if you could help me think through that? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yeah. So, let me hit that in two parts, Tom. First, yes, the Japan block is largely a FAS 60 block, so you're not going to see the types of K-factor resetting that you see in the FAS 97 and related products. So, that's correct. Having said that, and I guess the second point I was going to make is that, when we look at pricing, and so having adjusted down our long-term reversion rate, and Charlie may want to elaborate on this, but within the business or within all of our businesses, when we look at pricing, we don't look at pricing under any single scenario, we look at pricing across a range of scenarios. And I always like to describe the bookends of those scenarios. At one end of the book is the actuarial assumptions, and we would have taken that down from the 1.9% down to the 1.4%. At the other end of the spectrum would be a flat forever scenario where we assume that the current interest rate is sustained and we want to ensure that we're comfortable with the profitability of the book under that scenario. And in between there, we follow the forward curve and see what that looks like, as well. And so, any point in time we're pricing, we want to ensure that we're going to get adequate return relative to all of the scenarios in which we look at it. And we define that at \u2013 we do adjust the hurdle rate to reflect those different scenarios. So, if interest rates are likely to rise to our long-term reversion rate, we have a higher hurdle rate than we might have if we're in a sustained low interest rate environment forever. We would adjust for that. The diminution in our Japan books, in the latest quarter, if you looked at the delta between the pricing on those two bookends, it'd be a couple hundred basis points. That's for a series of products that do double-digit returns from a pricing standpoint. So, while it's a not-insignificant decline, what we wind up with is a book of business that's still producing a very attractive return on the capital that we have to hold against it. Charlie, I didn't know if you wanted to add anything to elaborate on that. Charlie F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yeah, and I'd just add a couple of things. One, Rob's absolutely right. We look at both bookends, and we make a determination on the pricing we want to have based on those two bookends. And it's usually somewhere in between, but we absolutely take into account low rates forever and look at that scenario. The other thing I would just say, which is kind of an obvious comment, but is the amount of U.S. dollar product we sell and foreign currency product we sell. So, while we are affected by the diminution in interest rates, we also \u2013 over 50% of our book that we sold this quarter was U.S. dollar product. Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI : Got you. And then just, Rob, just one final follow-up on that point, just to make sure I understand it. So your point was that maybe it's a couple of hundred basis points of deterioration on the ROE, but you'd still have double-digit returns, even after the reset. And because it's FAS 60, as long as you don't have no profit on the block, that would determine DAC amortization and whether DAC is recoverable. So you're not even remotely close to having any kind of impairment impact on DAC. Is that more or less the right way to think about it? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yeah, that's all correct, Tom. Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI : Okay, thanks. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hey, thanks, good morning. I was just hoping you could provide some more color on the drivers of the $7.7 billion of Asset Management flows and how the pipeline looks going forward? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Ryan, it's Steve. I will address that. The $7.7 billion reflects strength in multiple asset classes \u2013 particularly, however, fixed income. And the strength in fixed income is really across the board. It reflects positive flows, both institutional and retail, both from existing clients and from new mandates. It also reflects positive flows from both public and private sectors of the fixed income asset class. We're seeing the payoffs from our investments in our businesses \u2013 in our Asset Management business payoff. We really see that materializing, particularly in the distribution arena. A lot of our investments have been to be sure in our investment capabilities, but also in our distribution capabilities and strengthening our global Institutional client management framework. And we see that paying off. So, we still see the basis \u2013 high demand for what we do and the basis for strong flows. Obviously, we'll see what level they prove out to be, but we're confident that we have a very strong value proposition, and that that's being reflected in our flows. The other item I would mention is that outflows in our equity business continued, but at a mitigated level, due largely to our improved performance in those businesses. So, while we continue to see outflows in the equity business, they've been mitigated by that factor. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. And then on Retirement, you've fairly consistently had, I guess, what you've been characterizing as favorable case experience for a while now. I guess at what point \u2013 or are you getting closer to the point where you just feel like the profitability of the block is perhaps better than you originally priced it for? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Ryan, I just mentioned that we have, over the years, made several refinements and improvements of our expected case experience in pension risk transfer. So, it's not as if we haven't been raising the bar. At the same time, we've continued to see very strong case experience, even above those expectations that we have raised over time, including, by the way, this quarter where we raised expectations with a quarterly impact of about $5 million. We think that this type of case experience really serves to validate the very strong basis on which we have underwritten and priced this business. We continue to write this business in full achievement of our targeted returns in PRT, and we think that this type of case experience really bears that out. At the same time, we will continue to review our experience going forward. We have made some adjustments. We'll make further if our experience and analysis dictates that that's appropriate. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Suneet Kamath with Citi. Please go ahead. Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, there, thanks. Just wanted a clarification on the CTE 97 at moderate stress, assuming moderate stress. Can you just help us understand the \u2013 how you define moderate stress scenario, both in terms of equity markets and interest rates, and then over what sort of duration you're thinking? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Suneet, yeah, it's Rob. So, a combination of things that go through there. So, we look at a 20% decline in equity markets. I'm going to get the interest rate assumption wrong on that, and look to see if someone knows that. I want to say it's 50 basis points, but we'll have to verify that for you after the fact. And then, we have a \u2013 more importantly than that, we also have a credit deterioration that you would typically see in a recessionary-type scenario, so you have an expansion in credit spreads and some incurrence of credit losses. That extends out for a multi-year period of time and then is assumed to recover thereafter. So, the point, the duration of it is less important than when it actually happens because you have to actually survive the point of that downturn. And then, after that point in time, the stress becomes less. So, the duration of it is frankly less important than the actual quantums that we hit within a one to two-year period of time. Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Just on like the equity markets, what sort of recovery after that initial 20% do you assume? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: It's a normal, 8%, our long-term reversion rate, so it's an assumption that the total return on equities thereafter goes up by 8% per year; a combination of 2% dividend, 6% appreciation. Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Got it. And then just, I guess, a question for Mark, maybe on the ROE. I think at the Investor Day, you talked about the International ROE coming down 50 basis points a year, I think largely due to interest rates. But given that that division, I think, it uses almost half, maybe 40% of your overall equity, what are the businesses that you have that can generate ROE expansion to help offset that ROE decline? Or are we just looking at consolidated ROEs just continuing to face some pressure going forward? Thanks. Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: This is Mark. On Investor Day, I talked about regulation and supervision. So, I'm going to hand that one over to Rob, unless you want to come back to regulation and supervision. Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yeah, actually, and we're going to pass this right along. I think Charlie is probably in the best position to answer that. So, go ahead, Charlie. Charlie F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.: So what I would say is I think what we talked about was in Japan, the interest rates are coming down, and therefore, there would be some potential diminution over time of ROEs. On the other hand, we have some other countries like Brazil, which are small at this point, but which are increasing. And so, I think what you'll see is as we are successful in terms of expanding in other countries, that that diminution may be mitigated some \u2013 the diminution in Japan may be mitigated to a certain extent by the growth in the other countries. John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: I guess the other thing I'd add is that when we think about ROEs, obviously, they're not \u2013 we're not immune to the market environment, but what we're focusing on is relative performance of ROEs. And what we believe, Suneet, is by virtue of our business mix, by virtue of our fundamentals and the quality with which we're operating these businesses, that we would aspire to be very near the top of the pack in terms of relative comparison to anyone in the space. Absolute numbers may move a little because of absolute levels of interest rate, but in terms of relative performance, our aspiration is absolutely unchanged from what it's been in terms of our overall outcome. Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: And just adding to that, so it's fully understood the 12% to 13% guidance that we provided last year fully incorporated the anticipation of the diminution in the ROE in Japan over time. So, there was \u2013 that's not something above and beyond the guidance that we gave that went from the 13% to 14% to 12% to 13% ROEs. Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: I got that part, it's just once we get past the near-term, which I think is your target, 12% to 13% is sort of over the near term, I'm trying to think of, is the next phase higher than 12% to 13% or is it actually potentially lower than that, just given the International business coming down? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: I'm not 100% sure how to answer that question, Suneet. What I would say is that when we look at the long-term sustainable rate, we look at it against the interest rate environment. And so, if interest rates in Japan remain low for a long period of time, but rates rise within the U.S., then, yeah, the Japanese component of our business would continue to have a more modest ROE. And therefore, we might go back to the lower end of the 13% to 14% range that we gave before, as opposed to a mid or higher point of it. So, you'd have to think about. If what you're asking is if rates go up in the U.S. but don't go up in Japan, how do we think about that? Japan is 40%, 45% of the earnings, and therefore, the return there would be \u2013 the lower return there would be sustained and we'd have a more muted bounce back, but nonetheless, a bounce back. Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thanks. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, I had a couple of questions. First, you've discussed in the past just disruption in the annuity market from the DOL rule. So, wondering if that's continued through this quarter or has that eased a bit? And besides annuities, how do you think about the impact of the rule on other businesses in the U.S., specifically the DC business? And then, could you just discuss the driver of the drop in the Life consultant count at Gibraltar? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Jimmy, this is Steve. I will address your question. In regard to annuity sales, we do think what we've seen over the last couple of quarters, not just us, but the industry, is meaningfully driven by continued ambiguity around final outcomes in the DOL Fiduciary rule. As you know, a review period is underway and we, along with many others in the industry, are making our voice heard in that review and about the importance of ensuring that middle class Americans are still able to access financial advice and financial solutions, including retirement income solutions. But, as that review is still pending and still underway, I think continued ambiguity regarding final outcome of the rule may still continue to have an impact on sales. For us, while we saw a decline from year ago quarter in sales, we did see a modest sequential quarter pick-up, and that was due to some repricing of our PDI product that we did towards the end of the first quarter. In regard to other businesses, we do think that on an industry basis there could be some impact from the rule to the DC business. However, we think that impact would be largely felt at the smaller end of the market, where, for example, high proprietary ratios of Asset Management products in DC plans are the norm. We generally participate in the upper range of the market and we would expect the impact on us from that phenomenon to be minimum. Charlie F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.: And Jimmy, this is Charlie. On the second \u2013 your second question, I'll be short and sweet. We raised the bar. So, we have a more stringent recruiting process, we have slightly higher terminations because we raised the standards. We've been doing that around the world in various countries, so you saw us do it in Korea and Taiwan last year and we continually raise the bar. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And just one more on International, did you see a benefit on your sales from front-ending, just related to the pricing changes with the lower discount rate? And if you did, then would you expect to drop off in the second half? Not have been looking for guidance as much as just what you're seeing in the market of second quarter versus second half. Charlie F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, intuitively, I think your comment is correct. We certainly saw an acceleration or a surge, if you will, from yen products in the first half of the year. Interestingly, we also saw a commensurate increase in the sales of U.S. dollar products. So, it wasn't just yen products, but U.S. dollar products, which weren't affected by the discount rate. I think that shows the power of our distribution franchise. But, given the fact that we had accelerated sales in the first half, I think it is intuitive to say that in the second half we may see sort of a slight decrease, but hard to tell how much, in part because Life Planner count did increase by 6% and Gibraltar usually has, or always has a seasonal surge in the second quarter to a certain extent. So, hard to tell how much, but intuitively and directionally, I think your comment is correct. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Brad, we have time for one more question. Operator : And there currently are no more questions in queue at this time, sir. John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Good. Thank you very much, everyone. Have a good day.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mark Finkelstein. Please go ahead, sir. Alan Mark Finkelstein - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thank you, Roxanne. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today's call are John Strangfeld, CEO; Mark Grier, Vice Chairman; Charlie Lowrey, Head of International Businesses; Steve Pelletier, Head of Domestic Businesses; Rob Falzon, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by John, Mark, and Rob, and then we will answer your questions. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of such measures to the comparable GAAP measures, and a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, please see the section titled, Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures of our earnings press release, which can be found on our website at www.investor.prudential.com. And with that, I will hand it over to John. John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. I will begin by saying that we're very pleased with the quarter. We reported record adjusted operating earnings per share that were driven by strong fundamental trends and solid momentum across our businesses. I will provide some higher-level observations on the quarter, and then comment on business fundamentals, capital deployment, and other key topics of interest. And following that, I'll hand it over to Mark and Rob to cover the specifics. Third quarter adjusted operating income excluding market driven and discrete items of $2.94 per share was well above the prior year of $2.51 per share. The annualized ROE for the quarter was over 14%, exceeding our near to intermediate term objective of 12% to 13%. In addition, adjusted book value per share increased 6% over the third quarter of 2016, which is after paying $2.95 per share in dividends. At a high level, results in the quarter benefited from strong margins and good growth across a number of our businesses. We reported record assets under management and account values in our Asset Management, Retirement, and Individual Annuities businesses, and while results in the quarter benefited from items that are inherently variable, the earnings power of our businesses continues to trend higher. I'll now briefly touch on some fundamental trends in our businesses, starting with our domestic businesses. We reported record adjusted operating earnings in our Asset Management business driven by strong net flows, market appreciation, and stable average fee rates. Importantly we are seeing the benefits of AUM growth translating directly to strong growth in our core earnings, even while we continue to invest in distribution and product initiatives. Unaffiliated third party net flows were robust at 6 billion in the quarter and we reported record total AUM of 1.1 trillion. This includes nearly 600 billion of unaffiliated third party AUM. While results for the quarter benefited from some items that will vary we continue to be very pleased with the core growth in AUM, and earnings from Asset Management. Retirement had a solid quarter, reporting good earnings and net flows. I would highlight that after several quarters of strong outperformance in this segment which included particularly favorable pension risk transfer case experience, the third quarter returned to a more normal level of earnings that was broadly in line with our expectations. We set a new record for account values in both our Full Service and Institutional Retirement businesses. While we are clearly benefiting from market appreciation, we have also generated strong net flows including 7 billion of positive net flows this quarter. This reflects a number of good wins in both our defined contribution and pension risk transfer businesses. We also reported record core results in our Individual Annuities business. Return on assets of 128 basis points continues to benefit from enhancements to our risk management strategy and growth in our account values. As we mentioned last quarter, we do expect our return on assets to moderate from the particularly strong levels currently, but we nonetheless continue to be pleased with the earnings, cash generation, and reduced volatility from Annuities. In the meantime, we are focused on a number of product and distribution initiatives and while we continue to face near term sales challenges we remain optimistic on the longer term prospects for annuities as the need for Retirement income products is only increasing. Our U.S. protection businesses showed solid results. Group Insurance continues to produce strong underwriting margins generating a benefit ratio that again was more favorable than our expected range. We are also pleased to see the improved performance in our Individual Life Insurance business, which benefited from favorable mortality experience in the quarter. Turning to our international businesses, we produced good overall results that were broadly in line with our expectations. Our Life Planner and Gibraltar businesses continue to show stable core growth and good underwriting margins. Not surprisingly, sales were down 11% compared to a year ago quarter. This is largely due to the re-pricing of yen based products in Japan which we believe accelerated sales to the first half of the year. Despite these pressures we did produce strong growth in our U.S. dollar products in Japan which were up 15% over the prior year. And for the first time, more than half of our Japan sales in both Life Planner and Gibraltar were from U.S. dollar products. Shifting to capital deployment, we returned approximately $640 million of capital to shareholders in the quarter, about equally split between dividends and buybacks. This brings our total capital return to our shareholders since 2011 to approximately $14 billion. We continue to have a robust capital position, and a business model that generates considerable free cash flow. This provides flexibility to return healthy amounts of capital to shareholders, execute strategic M&A and continue to invest in our businesses for the long-term growth. And finally I want to make a couple observations on key topics of interest. I'll start with the recent report issued by the U.S. Treasury that addresses the administration's core principles for financial regulation in respect of asset managers and insurers. While this report does not produce any explicit change to existing laws or regulations, it contains a number of recommendations that align closely with Prudential's policy positions. In particular, we're pleased with the recommendations that systemic risk evaluation should be more activities based than entity focused. And there should be greater coordination between the various regulatory bodies. We continue to believe that we do not meet the criteria of a nonbank systemically important financial institution and are encouraged by the recent direction of Treasury and the Financial Stability Oversight Council. On potential tax reform, we support effective tax policy that promotes growth and investment by corporations and greater financial flexibility for individuals to enable them to save more for retirement. While we wouldn't want to speculate on what the final legislation will look like, we are well positioned to observe the near term capital impacts that could arise and we believe more broadly that a lower corporate tax rate should be a net long-term positive. So to conclude my remarks, we had an excellent quarter and we remain positive on our strategies to produce long-term growth and consistent financial outcomes across our businesses. We continue to invest in initiatives that leverage our differentiated capital capabilities to capitalize on powerful market themes, such as the need for retirement readiness. This includes enhancing the ways in which we connect and engage with our customers. And at the same time, we're generating strong returns and substantial cash flow in our businesses, and this enables us to strike the right balance between investing in growth and returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And with that, I'll hand it over to Mark. Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thanks, John. Good morning, good afternoon or good evening. Thank you for joining our call today. I'll take you through our results and then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon who will cover liquidity, leverage and capital highlights. And I'm starting on slide 2. After tax adjusted operating income amounted to $3.01 per share for the quarter compared to $2.66 a year ago. After adjusting for $0.07 per share of market driven and discrete items, which I will discuss momentarily, EPS amounted to $2.94 for the quarter, up from $2.51 a year ago, as the core performance of our businesses overall was strong in the quarter. Looking across our businesses I'll mention a few highlights of results compared to a year ago. First, fees from our Individual Annuities, Asset Management and Retirement businesses increased by about $140 million, reflecting market appreciation and positive flows. The annuity business also benefited from the ongoing favorable impacts of our annual assumption updates last quarter and refinements to our risk management strategy which was implemented last year. Second, a lower loss from corporate and other operations driven by favorable fluctuations in expenses and investment income. And third, continued business growth in our International Insurance business on a constant currency basis. Together, these items had a net favorable impact of approximately $0.42 per share on the comparison of results to a year ago. In addition, results in the current quarter benefited from positive variances in comparison to our average expectations, or our trend considerations, related to favorable claims experience and reserve refinements across businesses, and also to favorable non-coupon investment returns and prepayment income. These were partially offset by higher than typical expenses which collectively contributed about $0.04 per share to earnings. After adjusting for market driven and discrete items our EPS of $8.63 for the first 9 months of 2017 implies an ROE of 14.4% on an annualized basis. In thinking about our earnings pattern, I would note that in recent years, many of our businesses have had higher than average expenses in the fourth quarter, including the impact of seasonal items such as annual policyholder communications and onboarding, as well as business development, advertising, and other variable costs. Looking back over the past three years, this pattern has produced expenses on average about $125 million to $175 million higher in the fourth quarter than the average quarterly level for the respective year. On a GAAP basis including amounts categorized as realized investment gains or losses, and results from divested businesses, we reported net income of $2.2 billion for the current quarter, or $5.09 per share, about $900 million above our after-tax adjusted operating income. This difference was mainly driven by a positive impact from product derivatives which I will discuss shortly. Moving to slide 3, for the current quarter, market driven and discrete items consist only of our quarterly market and experience unlockings in the Annuities business. These favorable unlockings were mainly driven by the performance of equities in our customer accounts and resulted in a net benefit of $0.07 per share. Turning to slide 4, our GAAP net income of $2.2 billion in the current quarter includes amounts characterized as pre-tax net realized investment gains of $1.2 billion, and divested business results and other items outside of adjusted operating income amounting to a net pre-tax gain of $97 million. Of note, product related derivatives and hedging had a positive impact of $1 billion, largely driven by applying wider credit spreads in the calculation of our non-performance risk related to the Annuities living benefits. The $445 million gain from the general investment portfolio and related activities was driven by equity security and foreign currency related gains in our international insurance operations. The loss of $307 million from other risk management activities was driven by currency hedges, as the U.S. dollar weakened compared to certain other currencies. Moving to our business results, and starting on slide 5, I'll discuss the comparative results excluding the market driven and discrete items that I mentioned earlier. Annuities earnings were $529 million for the quarter, a record high and up by $80 million from a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by a greater contribution from policy charges and fee income reflecting a 4% increase in our variable annuity average separate account values and the ongoing benefit from the annual assumption updates last quarter, as well as positive impacts from the refinements in our risk management strategy for product guarantees that we implemented last year. Record high return on assets or ROA of 128 basis points reflects the strong earnings I just mentioned and is up modestly from last quarter. As we mentioned last quarter, a portion of the elevated ROA is sustainable, including the impact of the prior-quarter annual actuarial review. However we do not expect to be able to maintain this elevated level as a baseline in the future. Notably we continue to evaluate enhancements to our risk management approach to optimize the balance between earnings, liquidity, capital flexibility and volatility. And to a lesser extent we do expect future fee levels to be impacted over time by our product diversification strategy and by the aging of our business. Slide 6 presents our annuity sales. Total gross sales of $1.3 billion in the quarter are down by $800 million from a year ago and $200 million from the prior quarter. This trend in gross sales reflects the actions we have taken to re-price our PDI product, consistent with our diversification strategy, as well as broader industry sales pressures including the continued impact of the Department of Labor fiduciary rules. Turning to slide 7, Retirement earnings were $248 million for the quarter, down by $25 million from a year ago. The decrease was driven by a lower contribution from net investment spread results partially offset by more favorable case experience and higher full-service fee income. The contribution from net investment results was down about $60 million from a year ago. Current quarter earnings from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees were about $5 million below our average expectations compared to a contribution about $55 million above expectations a year ago. The impact of a 4% increase in average spread-based account values was largely offset by continued spread compression. Current quarter case experience was consistent with our average expectations, compared to about $20 million less favorable than expectations a year ago. Turning to slide 8, total Retirement gross deposits and sales were $16 billion for the current quarter, compared to $12.3 billion a year ago. The current quarter sales included a $5.7 billion full-service defined contribution plan sale, a $2.2 billion longevity reinsurance case and several funded pension risk transfer cases totaling $1.6 billion. These transactions contributed to net flows in the current quarter of $7.3 billion. Total Retirement Account Values were a record at $415.8 billion, up by 8% from a year earlier. This increase includes the benefit from market appreciation, as well as about $4.2 billion of positive net flows over the past year. Turning to slide 9, Asset Management earnings were a record-high $259 million for the quarter, compared to $191 million a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by higher Asset Management fees, reflecting the 6% growth in average assets under management. The increase in earnings also reflects a $13 million higher contribution from other related revenues which amounted to $29 million in the current quarter, driven by strong strategic investing results. In addition, results benefited from a particularly strong contribution from commercial mortgage agency loan originations, which was $12 million higher than the year-ago quarter, as well as recent averages. Asset Management reported $6 billion of net unaffiliated third party flows in the quarter, excluding money market activity, with contributions from the institutional and retail business each driven by strong fixed income flows, partially offset by equity outflows. On a year to date basis we have produced $14.3 billion of unaffiliated third party net flows. Turning to slide 10, Individual Life earnings were $150 million for the quarter, compared to $111 million a year ago. The increase primarily reflects favorable mortality experience which was about $10 million more favorable than our average expectations in the current quarter compared to about $30 million less favorable than our average expectations in the year ago quarter. In addition, the current quarter results include the benefit of reserve refinements and lower than typical expenses, which together amounted to about $15 million, while the year ago quarter included charges for reserve refinements and higher than typical legal costs which amounted to $20 million. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable ongoing impact of the second quarter 2017 Annual Review, an update of actuarial assumptions and other refinements. Turning to slide 11, Individual Life sales based on annualized new business premiums, were essentially consistent with the year-ago quarter. Lower Guaranteed Universal Life sales were offset by higher sales across the other products, reflecting specific distribution and product actions we have taken. Turning to slide 12, Group Insurance earnings were $61 million for the quarter, compared to $62 million a year ago. More favorable underwriting results were offset by higher expenses and a lower contribution from net investment spread results, as returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees were about $10 million above our average expectations in the year-ago quarter. The Group Insurance benefits ratio was below the low end of our targeted range of 87% to 91%, reflecting favorable group life and disability results. The contribution to current quarter results from underwriting experience net of a related adjustment to deferred acquisition costs, was about $10 million more favorable than the low end of our expected range. Moving to International Insurance and turning to slide 13, earnings for our Life Planner business were $373 million for the quarter, compared to $391 million a year ago. Excluding a $5 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, earnings decreased by $13 million from a year ago. The decrease was driven by higher expenses, partially offset by continued business growth, with constant dollar insurance revenues up by 7% from a year ago. Current quarter results included about $40 million of higher than typical net expenses including updates to legal reserves. Claims experience in the current quarter and the year-ago quarter was about $10 million more favorable than our average expectations. In addition, returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees were about $10 million above our average expectations in comparison to returns only slightly above our average expectations in the year ago quarter. Turning to slide 14, Gibraltar Life earnings were $426 million for the quarter, compared to $389 million a year ago. Excluding a $1 million positive impact from foreign currency exchange rates, earnings increased by $36 million from a year ago. This increase reflects lower expenses, including the absence of higher than typical costs associated with employee benefit plans, and office relocations incurred in the year-ago quarter, and more favorable policy benefits experience and continued business growth. Claims experience in the current quarter and the year ago quarter was about $10 million more favorable than our average expectations. The current quarter net investment spread results included returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees slightly above our average expectations. Before leaving international results, I will note that we have substantially completed the hedging of our expected yen earnings for 2018, and our hedging rate for next year is expected to be 111 yen per U.S. dollar. That compares to 112 this year. Turning to slide 15, International Insurance sales on a constant basis, on a constant dollar basis, were $671 million for the current quarter, down by $87 million, or 11%, from a year ago. On a year to date basis, 2017 sales were 3% above the first nine months of the prior year. We have experienced similar trends in both Life Planner and Gibraltar operations where sales decreased by $36 million and $51 million, respectively, largely driven by lower sales in Japan. In total, yen based product sales in Japan decreased by $131 million from the prior year, as current quarter sales were lower due to the elevated level of sales in the first half of this year, in advance of rate increases which are driven by the lowering of the standard discount rate effective last quarter. This was partially offset by an increase in U.S. dollar sales in Japan of $56 million, driven by the increased attractiveness of U.S. dollar products in the current environment as well as the introduction of a U.S. dollar whole life product with nursing care benefits last quarter. As a consequence the vast majority of sales in Japan were U.S. dollar denominated. Sales outside of Japan were consistent with last year, as growth in Brazil was offset by modest declines in other markets. Turning to slide 16, the corporate and other loss was $310 million for the current quarter, compared to a $413 million loss a year ago. The main drivers of the variance are : lower expenses, including lower costs for employee benefit and compensation plans with obligations that are remeasured each quarter based on equity markets or on our company share price as well as other corporate expenses, which can fluctuate, a greater contribution from investment income net of interest costs including higher income on equity method investments and highly liquid assets as well as lower interest expense, and finally higher income from our pension plan, following our assumption update at year-end last year. Now I'll turn it over to Rob. Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thank you, Mark. I'm going to provide a brief update on key balance sheet items and financial measures starting on slide 17. Following the recapture of our living benefit risks and the refinements we made to our risk management strategies in 2016, we view the RBC ratios at Prudential Insurance or PICA and PALAC as well as the composite RBC shown here to be important measures of our financial strength. Having said that, as we have highlighted previously, we manage our annuity risks using an economic framework that includes holding total assets to a CTE 97 level, with the ability to maintain that level through moderate stresses. As a consequence, over time, we may see some variability in the excess of PALAC's RBC over our target ratio. At December 31, 2016, the PICA, PALAC and composite ratios were well above our target, and we estimate that they continue to be well above our target at the end of the third quarter. In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margin ratios of 844% and 902% respectively as of June 30. These solvency margin ratios are comfortably above our targets, and we estimate that they continue to be so at the end of the third quarter. Looking at the liquidity leverage and capital deployment highlights on slide 18, highly liquid assets at the parent company amounted to $4.4 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of around $700 million from June 30. This increase is driven by the $750 million hybrid debt issuance in the current quarter. While we continue to evaluate uses of capital we have higher cost hybrid Securities totaling about $600 million that are callable in 2018, and we took advantage of an opportune time in the market to issue new hybrid securities. As noted by John during the quarter, we returned about $640 million to shareholders, including $324 million of dividends, and $312 million of share repurchases under the $1.25 billion authorization for the year. And finally, our financial leverage and total leverage ratios were within our targets, as of the end of the third quarter. Now I'll turn it back over to John. John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thank you, Rob. Thank you, Mark. We'd like to now open it up to questions. Operator : And our first question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous. Please go ahead. Erik Bass - Autonomous Research : Hi, thank you. In Annuities, you've commented that you see material upside to your long term ROA targets near term, and we certainly saw that this quarter. Can you just help us think about how that ROA normalizes over time if markets perform in line with your expectations? Is this something that happens over a few quarters or could the outperformance last longer than that? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Erik, this is Steve Pelletier. I'll touch up on your question and maybe I'll hand it over to Rob for further comments. Obviously, we're very pleased with the performance of the business. It generated strong earnings, strong ROA, and strong cash flows. The elevated ROA reflects a number of factors, in particular favorable equity market conditions, the strong performance by the funds on our platform, and in particular continued favorability in the emergence of our risk management framework. And all of that contributed to a marginal increase to ROA compared to the previous quarter, largely stable with the previous quarter. We believe some of this lift is sustainable, but we aren't expecting to maintain that full increase in ROA going forward. In particular we're always looking at ways of managing our risk to create the best economic outcomes across scenarios, and optimizing trade-offs between increased ROAs and the ability to further decrease volatility and increase our flexibility with respect to distributable earnings and capital. Our guidance as to how we think about the ROAs in this business are unchanged from last quarter when we said that we see the long-term sustainable ROA in that 110 to 115 basis points range over the long run still with meaningful upside in the near term. In terms of some of the particular aspects you queried about in terms of how that ROA normalizes over a period, I'll ask Rob to expand further. Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. So Erik, I think about it sort of in two buckets. The first is a group of things that on the margin have the ROA elevated that we think will reduce over time, and that would be we've gotten some positive hedge breakage that we don't forecast to be sort of normal over a long period of time. We are seeing both spread compression and fee compression in the business as a result of on the fee side at least, the book maturing and the diversification strategy that we've had for our products. So on the margin, those things will play out over a longer period of time, in response to your question. The other driver, the larger driver, is the change in hedge tactics going forward that Steve alluded to. So recall we managed the VA block to a CTE 97, and we have, and as I stated in my remarks, we hold at that level such that we can sustain it through a level of cyclical stress. We've previously indicated that within that risk management construct we're continually evaluating our hedge tactics and we try to optimize the mix of derivatives and cash instruments that we use. We're looking at balancing cash flow and earnings against liquidity, ensuring flexibility and looking to reduce volatility where we can. Given the run up in the markets and the benefit we're seeing from our assumption updates, we see this as a good opportunity to revisit those hedge tactics in order to further decrease the interim volatility, increase flexibility particularly with respect to distributable earnings. We actually began implementing this in the third quarter of 2017, though the costs were not so material that you actually saw it come through and impact the ROA. And we're going to continue to adjust it through the rest of 2017 and 2018. The remainder as I mentioned before the other drivers are things that will affect ROA over a longer period of time than that. So I think it's fair to say that we expect the ROA will continue to be above that long-term expectation in the near to intermediate term, but will migrate over to closer to it in the course of 2017 and 2018 and then over a longer period of time more in line with that long-term objective. Erik Bass - Autonomous Research : Thank you. Thanks helpful. And, Rob, in your comments you mentioned a couple times kind of the balance on cash flow generation. I was just hoping you could comment on your free cash flow target of 60% over time. I realize it may be something you want to address on the outlook call but just based on your comments about the improved contribution from Annuities, should we think about that 60% range having moved higher? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: So it's a good question, Erik. I think both from our Annuities business and frankly from our other businesses we're seeing across a strong generation of cash flow and capital. And recall that we had actually increased our free cash flow guidance from 50% to 60% back when we gave guidance in 2015. So since that point in time, both our visibility and our confidence in our cash flow generation have both risen. Having said that, at this point in time, we're not changing our guidance. And it is something that we'll revisit and as appropriate we'll talk about in December when we visit on guidance. Erik Bass - Autonomous Research : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Suneet Kamath, Citi. Please go ahead. Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Just wanted to go to the Asset Management business. If I just look at your slide and adjust for some of the non-trendable items, it seems like the core fee business is up pretty dramatically especially relative to AUM. So I'm just trying to get a sense of what's driving that what I'd call operating leverage and do you think it's sustainable going forward? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Suneet, this is Steve, I'll address that question. I think just kind of work through the sequence. We're seeing very strong flows across a number of asset classes but particularly in fixed income, both public and private fixed income. We're seeing the ability to sustain our average fee level across the entire platform, and that's a pretty distinctive outcome in the active Asset Management business. We've been able to do that by attracting particularly strong flows into some higher-fee yielding strategies. A lot of those flows come into businesses that are already at scale. In particular a lot of the flows have come into our fixed income business where the scale economies are particularly attractive. Obviously some degree of market friendliness has helped to some extent, but you put all that together, and what you see is margin expansion and a very attractive bottom-line result in the Asset Management business. It's good to see this emerge, but it's not necessarily a surprise to us. In the past few years, we've been investing in this business. We've been investing in order to expand our distribution capabilities, and to expand our product set, and further extend our bench strength in our investment platforms. All of that has played out over time. Last year, we started to see the flows come from these investments. Now those flows are continuing, and the flows are translating into earnings, so I think what we're seeing is the logical consequence of the investments we've made and the achievement of the objectives of those investments. Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it, okay. And then just switching over to international and noting the strong U.S. dollar sales growth, we're also hearing that from other companies so are you seeing incremental competition in terms of pricing in international on the foreign currency products? Charlie F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yeah, it's Charlie, I'll take that. So we haven't seen much competition in the LP or LC channels nor in the IA channel, per se, partly because of the nature of what we sell which is death protection. Don't forget that 60% or two-thirds of what we sell is sort of pure death protection. And partly due to the way in which we sell it, which is needs based selling through the LPs and the LCs. But we have seen some increased competition in the bank channel. Most of the competition we've seen actually has been in the recurring premium yen product where we have raised prices and others have held the line, so we've seen a fall there. But interestingly we haven't seen as much competition yet for the recurring premium U.S. dollar product. In terms of single premium product, we sell virtually no single premium yen product anymore in any channel. We eliminated those last year. And on the single premium U.S. dollar annuity product we've seen some additional competition and realistically we'd expect to see more in the future as others enter the market. But to put this into perspective the single premium U.S. dollar product we sold in the third quarter was less than 5% of our total bank sales or about $8 million. So this isn't a particularly big number. But that's where our differential or differentiated distribution strategy really comes into play, with seconded LPs in the bank channel and a dedicated wholesaler distribution strategy in the IA channel, which will become even more important and a more important distinguishing factor as we go forward. So short answer, we've seen some increased competition on the U.S. dollar side, but not as much as we might have expected. Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ryan Krueger, KBW. Please go ahead. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi, thanks, good morning. In regards to your strategy to reduce, further reduce variable annuity volatility I guess once that gets implemented, should we think about that as having any potential impact to your view of capital deployment? In other words, if your confidence increases around downside risk could you potentially deploy more of your existing on-balance-sheet capital? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Ryan, it's Rob so I wouldn't think of it that way because we're holding capital to a CTE 97 and that is not changing by virtue of what we're talking about with regard to tactics. I would think about it more around confidence levels around distributable cash flow. So given by mix, differentiating the mix between derivatives and cash instance that we use, what we can do is reduce the volatility in earnings in any given scenario. And by virtue of doing that we enhance the ability to take that earnings, translate it into free cash flow and distribute it out of the business. So I think it's really more targeted about toward interim volatility and distributable cash flow and really leaves capital unaffected. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Understood, thanks. And then can you give us any sense of the potential quantification of the reduction in the admitted deferred tax asset on the U.S. statutory basis from potential tax reform? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: So if it's okay Ryan, actually let me try to bring that up a level and talk maybe a little bit more broadly about tax reform as opposed to isolating one particular aspect of it because you really need to think about it sort of across the spectrum of ways in which it could affect our capital position. First two points before I dig into that. Let me reiterate what John said up front, which is longer term lower corporate tax rates all things being equal are a positive for us and for businesses. And so we look at the opportunity for tax reduction as being something that's going to be beneficial. And two most of our focus on this, is frankly going to be on implications to product and wanting to ensure that consumers are still have the proper motivations and incentives to continue to save for retirement. With regard to the capital piece of it, we have run a whole series of analyses on this, and I guess what I would say is just to sort of provide a conclusion on it for you, Ryan, is that under all those analyses, our insurance companies would continue to be capitalized at AA levels. Our leverage would remain within our targets, our liquidity would remain well above our minimums and we would expect no disruption to our shareholder distribution plans. So DTA in terms of your specific question is entirely factored into that. One other thing I'd just sort of throw out, while we did that analysis and look at that in the context of existing constructs and metrics around what a AA means, I would note that while there's the possibility that through tax reform, there could be a negative impact to capital ratios in the way that they're calculated, you also have to remember that for insurers, we have a significant margin in our reserves, and that that margin in reserves in our case in any event, is well in excess of the equity that we have, the capital that we have, within the business. And so the benefit to the margins in reserves on an after tax basis will well exceed any detriment that occurs to our capital by virtue of a higher tax rate. And therefore, while we did all our analysis assuming that there's not going to be any changes in metrics, you would have to consider that benefit to the strengthening effectively of your after tax reserves is something that would be considered into what would ultimately be deemed sort of the appropriate solvency ratios post-tax reform. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. Thanks a lot for the responses. Operator : Our next question is from Tom Gallagher, Evercore. Please go ahead. Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI : Good morning. First question on regulatory : So AIG was recently dedesignated, and, John, I heard your comments about the Treasury report on insurers. I guess just specifically would you expect Prudential to be able to pursue a path to also bring your designation to a vote? Can you talk a little bit about how that process might work? Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yeah, Tom, it's Mark. I've been saying I guess over a couple of calls now that we anticipate that at some point, we would no longer be designated as a SIFI and that there are several ways to get there, one which is probably somewhat remote would be Dodd-Frank reform in Congress, but another choice would be pursuing a variety of administrative channels reflecting some of the implications of the thoughts reflected in the Treasury report on insurance. Keep in mind there's also a report coming out on FSOC that will address the designation process, so there'll be another round of thinking about that, and so that will also be part of how we'll consider the steps that we take going forward. But I would say the tone of things with respect to the administrative side is at least favorable to the consideration of activities based approaches as opposed to entity designations, and so that's how we're thinking about it as well and we'll be considering those as we possibly move forward. One thing to add is that we also have legal options, and so if things are not unfolding in a positive direction with respect to administrative processes, we also have the option to go to court. So there are a number of different ways in which this can happen. We're encouraged by the points that are made in Treasury's report. We're looking forward to what comes out about FSOC and we'll take it from there. Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI : Got you. Thanks, Mark. And then just a follow-up question is on I know in the first half of the year, there were net contributions into the Japanese subs. Would you expect, did that reverse in 3Q? And will you expect kind of normal cash flows out of Japan during the back half of the year? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Tom, it's Rob. So Japan goes into the same basket that when I commented on seeing strong cash flow and distributable cash flow coming across our businesses. I spoke to annuities, but Japan would be included in that as well. Year to date we have repatriated out of Japan around $900 million. Recognize that we typically repatriate from Japan in the second half of the year, so you'll see a concentration of that coming in the latter half. The form in which we repatriate we have a variety of tools for doing that. Obviously given the potential for tax reform, we're being sensitive and sensible about how we go about doing that. And so you won't necessarily see that coming through a dividend line in the sources and uses. It comes through other mechanisms that we employ, but can and will use dividends as things become more clear on the tax front. And you made a comment about contributions into Japan in the earlier part of the year. I would sort of just for clarity on that, the contributions into our international business in the early part of the year were largely driven by the joint venture investments and acquisitions that we've been doing. So the vast majority of that has been funding the things we've done for instance in Africa, in Brazil and in Indonesia. So that wasn't really capital consumption by Japan itself, but rather our growth initiatives internationally. Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI : Got it. And Rob, the $900 million is that a net number or that's just a gross number of the amount that's the repatriation you took out and then there might, that's the $400 million which I hear you on what that was being used for. Were there other offsetting beyond the $400 million, were there other offsetting payments down? Or is that a net $900 million number out? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: The $900 million is a gross number Tom, but when you net out, when you take the acquisition activity out the amount that would then get netted down from that is a less consequential amount. You're dealing with something that's probably a couple hundred million dollars, and remember the biggest driver to that would be we have our equity hedge settlements for the, that this year, that's been $140 million/$150 million actually going toward Japan. Now remember that that's temporal, because that's a reflection of higher earnings that we get on a post-translation basis. But that would be part of the other part that would be sort of netted from the $900 million. Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI : Okay, thanks. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Humphrey Lee, Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead. Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC : Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. In terms of Asset Management, flows definitely have been very strong, especially on the institutional side. I was just wondering if you're seeing anything different in terms of where your clients are coming from and then also maybe if you can comment a little bit on the pipeline in the coming quarter. Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Humphrey, it's Steve, I'll address your question. We have seen a growth in flows from international clients. Again, that's been the objective of a lot of our investments in the business over the past couple of years. A big part of that was building out our institutional relationship management efforts on a global basis. So we have seen an increasing portion of flows coming from international markets, and we still see a robust picture. The types of strategies that we're offering, and the engagement that we have with clients continues to bode well for the success of the business. Bear in mind that this is a business that has had 14 consecutive years of positive net flows from institutional clients. Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC : Understood. And then I believe you recently got the approval for some active ETF strategies, and maybe can you talk about your appetite in terms of entering into some of these active ETFs or quantitative ETFs? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Right, I would address that, as well. I would say, Humphrey, that first of all, you used absolutely the right term, active ETFs, and I would emphasize that. Broadly speaking, we see the passive ETF space as being thoroughly spoken for. As it relates to our consideration around active ETFs, I think it's important to emphasize that this is, if we do something here, it would not be venturing into a brand new effort. ETFs are about smart beta capabilities. Active ETFs are about smart beta capabilities, enhanced indexing. Those are value propositions that we already have today and that we already advance into the market today, primarily through our QMA business. So any decision that we finally take in regard to the active ETF space would simply be a new vehicle by which we're delivering existing strategies and existing capabilities into the marketplace. Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC : Got it. Thank you for the color. Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Scott, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick one on pension risk transfer. I think there were some accounting changes that were going into effect in 4Q related to companies' ability to maybe it was capitalize some of the pension costs. And was wondering if you were expecting to see a more robust pipeline from that in the space, and if you would potentially look at bigger transactions, or if you sort of have a capped appetite at this point? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Alex, it's Steve, I'll address your question. Generally speaking, we continue to see a very robust pipeline. I'll kind of elevate the question and just discuss the pipeline overall. You heard Mark speak to our 3Q results in the business. I'd also point out it's in the public domain that since the end of the third quarter, we've also written an additional funded $1.3 billion case with international paper. We were very, very happy to see that. And what we see in the pipeline is both a strong propensity to transact and strong ability to transact. Rates are going up, or rates have gone up. That reduces the liability, and increases funding level and increases ability of plan sponsors to transact. At the same time, there's no broad expectation among plan sponsors that rates are due to spike upward further, so they have a strong propensity to transact at today's levels. PBGC premiums continue to be an issue that many plan sponsors are seeking to address. One dynamic that we continue to see play out in the market is even very large plan sponsors looking to bring maybe slices of their liability to the market. Those slices being comprised of liabilities that are large in head count, but with small benefits per participant. And again, in doing so, they're looking to eliminate administrative costs, and reduce the per-capita portion of PBGC premiums. That's a dynamic we've seen as underpinning several of the pieces of business that we've written this year and in the third quarter. So overall, we see the pipeline as being very strong, and we see the receptivity to the strength of our value proposition as being very promising. Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jimmy Bhullar, JPMorgan, please go ahead. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. First I just had a follow-up to Mark's comments on the SIFI designation. Doesn't seem like you've been constrained in a major way by the designation, but would losing the SIFI label affect your approach to capital? Or just your overall business strategy? Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: I would repeat what we've been saying for a long time, which is that we are not hoarding or jettisoning capital in anticipation of SIFI capital rules. And in fact, we think we do the right things around aligning capital and risk and resources and business strategies, so that's a long way of saying the answer is no, we would not anticipate changes with respect to the way in which we're managing capital as a result of the rescission of our designation. And we would also not expect any impact on the businesses. Keep in mind that we run with a very high measure of financial discipline including economics, GAAP accounting and statutory accounting and we've often said that we can meet higher standards. That's not a problem for us. And so we're very much in sync with the appropriate regulatory views on solvency and risk and capital and capital adequacy. So we've been comfortable as a supervised entity. The burden for us has more been in the arena of reporting and preparing for exams, and those sorts of things, as opposed to substantive consequences for the business. But again not because it isn't on the radar screen but because we think we're in good shape there. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And could you give us a rough number on how much you're spending on SIFI related reporting or SIFI related activities that might obviously go away once, if you are indeed undesignated? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Jimmy, it's Rob, so we spent about $135 million last year, about $88 million year to date and about $31 million in the third quarter. I would think about that as roughly in three buckets, Jimmy. One is there's about a third of it that if we were to be dedesignated would go away very rapidly. There's about a third of it which will go away over a period of time as we're finishing out projects that we began. They tend to be technology related and so those things get completed and they will burn off of their own volition in the course of 1 year to 2/2.5 years. And then the remaining third are costs that we think we actually will continue to incur because recall that while we may not be group supervised by the Fed, we will continue to be group supervised by New Jersey. And we continue to deal with developments that are occurring on the international front, and so there's a level of spending that we expect, spending and investment that we continue to expect that would be ongoing over a longer time. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, thank you. And if I could ask one more of Charlie on, in Gibraltar your Life Consultant count was down sequentially and wondering if that's because of changes in recruiting or productivity standards and whether that has an impact on expected sales in the business over the next year. Charlie F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Sure, happy to answer that. So both your comment and your observation are correct. So Life Consultant count decreased by about 5% year over year, and the decrease was due to a couple of things. One is an adherence to more stringent validation requirements as we talked about last time, and also more stringent recruiting processes. And this really has a double effect, right? Because on the one hand you have more terminations from more stringent validation requirements that are being enforced. And on the other hand you're recruiting slightly less people because you've raised the bar, you have higher recruiting standards. So you have less recruits. And it's tough to do this because when you elect to do this you enter kind of a J-curve if you will. And so we think we'll hit the bottom of the J-curve sometime next year. The Life Consultant count has been decreasing and will probably decrease for a little while longer. But that's exactly what we did in this business twice before. We did it when we acquired QOA originally, we did it when we acquired Star and Edison. And it's what we have done in Korea, Taiwan, Italy and Poland over the past 18 months, which is as we've said, sort of go back to the basics of increasing the quality in the field. So I would kind of label this as periodic business as usual meaning that periodically, we look at our requirements and we're continually raising the bar as we go forward. So that's kind of the situation where we are. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Roxanne, we have time for one more question. Operator : And that question comes from the line of John Barnidge, Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. John Bakewell Barnidge - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Thank you. How is PRU approach and implementation of MiFID II? And could that actually lead to cost saves? And will it be implemented globally in your Asset Management business? Thank you very much. Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: John, this is Steve. We've been planning and preparing for MiFID II requirements for some time. We intend to be in full compliance obviously by the effective date at the beginning of 2018. Just as a point of background, we have two MiFID firms in the EU that will be subject to the regulations. Our MiFID firms currently do not intend to pass research costs onto clients. We have significant experienced internal research groups and we don't expect any of the, any material impact from the research costs that we would absorb. As we think about the implications of MiFID II beyond the EU, we do see the potential that the new requirements for MiFID firms relating to research costs may have an impact on how research is distributed and paid for more broadly. And we're simply continuing to monitor the landscape and how the industry is evolving in this area. John Bakewell Barnidge - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T executive teleconference service. You may now disconnect.",

And with that I will hand it over to John. John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. 2017 was a strong year for Prudential. We exceeded our earnings objectives for the year and are showing solid momentum across our businesses. I will provide some higher level observations on results for the fourth quarter and full year, the underlying fundamental trends in our businesses, and capital deployment and I will then hand it over to Mark and Rob to go through the specifics. Fourth quarter operating earnings, excluding market driven and discrete items of $2.58 per share exceeded the prior year of $2.43 per share. The increase reflects business growth and higher (2:17) incentive fees, partially offset by lower underwriting margins and an increase in expenses. Recall that the fourth quarter results typically include elevated expenses, which we estimate to be approximately $0.25 per share for the current quarter. Turning to full year results, operating earnings, excluding market driven and discrete items were $11.31 a share for 2017, well above the prior year of $9.65 per share. This also exceeded the top end of the guidance range we established in December of 2016. Similarly, the operating return on equity of nearly 14% for the year was above our 12% to 13% near-term to intermediate-term objective. While full year results benefited from favorable markets and investment results as well as other items that can fluctuate, we are pleased with the core growth and underlying margins in our businesses overall. I would also highlight that adjusted book value per share increased 12% over the prior year end. While this includes a benefit from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts which Mark will discuss in more detail, adjusted book value per share increased a solid 8%, excluding this benefit. So overall, it was a very good year on almost all measures. While our base case for 2018 does not assume that we will produce the same return on equity that we did in 2017, the underlying themes around the quality of our businesses and consistency in execution should enable us to continue to produce returns exceeding industry averages and generate significant free cash flow, while also enabling us to continue to invest in our businesses for future growth. I will now touch on some of those themes in discussing the performance of our businesses. I'll start with our Retirement business, which continues to perform exceptionally well. Core growth remains robust with nearly $9 billion of positive net flows during 2017, which contributed to 11% year-over-year account value growth. Likewise, underwriting margins in the business continue to exceed our expectations, particularly in our flagship Pension Risk Transfer business. Our success in this business is a direct reflection of the differentiated capabilities that we deliver and we continue to see Retirement as a source of long-term growth going forward. In Investment Management, we achieved another important milestone as 2017 marked the 15th consecutive year of positive net flows from institutional clients and 13th consecutive year from retail clients. Over the last five years, unaffiliated third-party assets under management have grown annually at above 10%, including 15% in 2017. We continue to benefit from our multimanager model, strong investment performance across strategies, and positive outcomes from our recent initiatives. And while there are many challenges facing active investment managers, which we're not immune to, we continue to generate strong growth in assets under management and stable overall fee rates, leading to favorable financial results and a positive outlook We are also seeing strong performance out of our Individual Annuities business. Although industry-wide sales have been under pressure, we've taken thoughtful steps to manage the business more efficiently and effectively. And this has resulted in higher margins, increased amounts of free cash flow, and reduced capital volatility. Over the last two years we have generated deployable capital in excess of $3 billion from the Individual Annuities business, including over 1 billion in 2017. In Group Insurance, we're pleased with the performance of the business following the pricing and underwriting actions we took several years ago. The benefits ratio for 2017 was at the low end of our targeted range with solid underwriting results in both Group Life and Disability. In Individual Life, while results in 2017 were below what we anticipated due to adverse mortality and actions taken as part of our annual review of assumptions, this is a well-underwritten business and we continue to actively manage the composition of sales as the environment evolves. And turning to our International operations, we continue to deliver steady core growth and solid earnings and returns, including an ROE of 17% for 2017. We are particularly pleased at how our Japanese business adapted to price changes on Yen products in early 2017 through increased sales of foreign currency denominated products. Notably, U.S. dollar products grew 16% in 2017 and comprised over 60% of Japan's sales for the year. Looking forward, we expect our differentiated distribution model to continue to deliver stable growth at attractive margins despite some notable headwinds that we and others face in Japan. And we continue to be optimistic that newer markets like Brazil will have a more meaningful impact on results over the next several years. I will now turn to capital deployment. We returned about $635 million to shareholders in the fourth quarter. This brings our full year shareholder returns to $2.6 billion, about equally split between dividends and share repurchases. We generate considerable free cash flow from our businesses, which we now estimate to be about 65% of earnings over time. As a result of the higher earnings level along with the increased share of earnings that are deployable, we have increased the amount of capital we are returning to our shareholders. In that regard, we are pleased that yesterday our board authorized a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend. This follows a similar increase in our 2018 share repurchase authorization announced in December. We continue to put a high priority on capital generation and return to shareholders and we do so while continuing to invest in our businesses and maintaining a strong balance sheet. To sum up, we're quite pleased with 2017 results. We exceeded our earnings objectives for the year and continue to show good growth and margin fundamentals across our businesses. We're also excited about the longer term investments we are making, including those that will enable us to connect with customers with greater agility, over time, accelerate our growth rate. The recent realignment of our domestic business organizational structure will help facilitate these initiatives. While items like the positive impact to earnings from the Tax Act will provide a near-term boost, our focus is and always has been on delivering long-term growth and shareholder value and we remain confident that the combination of our superior business mix and track record of innovation and execution will enable us to do just that. So with that, I'd like to hand it over to Mark. Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thanks, John. Good morning, good afternoon, or good evening. I'll take you through our results and then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon, who will cover liquidity, leverage and capital highlights. I'll start on slide 2. After-tax adjusted operating income amounted $2.69 per share for the quarter compared to $2.46 a year ago. After adjusting for market driven and discrete items of $0.01 per share, EPS amounted to $2.68 for the quarter, up from $2.43 a year ago. Core performance of our businesses overall was solid in the quarter with results benefiting from higher fees in our Annuities and Investment Management businesses and continued business growth in International Insurance on a constant currency basis, partially offset by higher expenses. In addition, other related revenues in our Investment Management business of $92 million in the quarter were $70 million higher than the year-ago quarter as a result of higher incentive fees and stronger strategic investing results. Together, these items had a net favorable impact of approximately $0.27 per share on the comparison of results to a year ago. Current quarter results also reflect a net benefit from certain items that varied from our average expectations. This includes non-coupon investment returns and prepayment income, which were about $90 million above our average expectations in the quarter. This was offset by the impact of less favorable underwriting results relative to expectations in our Individual Life and Retirement businesses and other refinements that amounted to $45 million. The net effect of these items resulted in a benefit of about $0.07 per share. In thinking about our earnings pattern, I would also note that we estimate current quarter expenses for items such as technology and business development, advertising, annual policyholder communications and other variable costs were about $165 million or $0.25 per share above our quarterly average for the year, consistent with the historical pattern we mentioned when we discussed our third quarter results. On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $3.8 billion for the current quarter or $8.61 per share. GAAP net income in the current quarter was about $2.6 billion higher than our after-tax adjusted operating income and included a $2.9 billion or $6.64 per share estimated tax benefit related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and about $600 million of pre-tax net realized investment losses. Turning to slide 3, I'll address the financial impacts of the Tax Act. The current quarter tax benefit of $2.9 billion from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act includes two key components : a $3.4 billion benefit from the remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities arising from a lower U.S. corporate tax rate and the adoption of a territorial tax system; and a one-time tax expense of about $500 million from the deemed repatriation of unremitted taxable earnings of foreign subsidiaries as part of the transition to the territorial tax system. In addition, the $2.9 billion net tax benefit increased GAAP book value per common share as of December 31, 2017 by $6.59. This compares to an increase in adjusted book value of $2.74 per common share. The difference relates to an adjustment for deferred taxes that were originally established through accumulated other comprehensive income, primarily related to the deferred tax impact of unrealized gains and losses. Looking forward, we now expect the 2018 effective tax rate on adjusted operating income to be approximately 22% as compared to our 26% expectation provided in December in connection with our 2018 financial outlook. The reduction is primarily due to applying a lower tax rate to our U.S. business earnings. Moving to slide 4. I'll cover the market driven and discrete items for the quarter, which had a relatively small impact on results. These items include a benefit from our quarterly market and experience unlockings in the Annuity business, driven mainly by the performance of equities in customer accounts, partially offset by costs incurred in Corporate & Other related to a debt exchange transaction which we completed in December. Moving on to slide 5, which shows the items affecting pre-tax net income that are not included in adjusted operating income. Our current quarter GAAP net income includes pre-tax net realized investment losses of $581 million and divested business results and other items outside of adjusted operating income amounting to a net pre-tax gain of $26 million. Of note, the loss of $500 million from risk management activities was driven by currency hedges as the U.S. dollar weakened compared to certain other currencies and losses on other derivatives used in risk mitigation. Product related embedded derivatives and associated hedging had a negative impact of $332 million, largely driven by the non-economic impact of applying tighter credit spreads in the calculation of our non-performance risk related to the Annuities living benefits. The $338 million gain from the general investment portfolio and related activities was driven by equity and fixed income security related gains in our International operations. Slide 6 shows financial highlights for the year (15:46). Earnings per share for 2017 based on after-tax adjusted operating income amounted to $11.31 after adjusting for market driven and discrete items, which implies an ROE of 13.9%. The full year earnings per share increased by 17% from 2016, driven by strong underlying performance across our businesses and tailwinds from equity markets and non-coupon investment returns. Also, as I noted earlier, our adjusted book value per share as of December 31, 2017 of $88.28 includes a $2.74 benefit from the impact of the Tax Act. (16:31) business results, I'll start on slide 7. Let me first highlight that effective this quarter our business segments are organized consistent with the new U.S. business structure we announced in July. The new organizational structure retains our existing segments, but realigns them under new divisions. I will discuss the comparative results for each segment, excluding the market driven and discrete items I mentioned previously. Annuities earnings were $525 million for the quarter, up by $103 million from a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by a greater contribution from policy charges and fee income, reflecting a 7% increase in our variable annuity average separate account values and lower risk management costs, driven by favorable markets and hedging results and the ongoing benefit from our second quarter update of actuarial assumptions. Partially offsetting this increase was a lower contribution from net investment spread results, primarily due to the impact of lower reinvestment yields. Returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees were approximately $10 million above our average expectations in both the current quarter and the year-ago quarter. Annuities return on assets or ROA of 125 basis points is down modestly from last quarter's record level. As we mentioned during our financial outlook call, a portion of the elevated ROA compared to last year is sustainable, including the impact of the annual actuarial assumption updates, and therefore we expect to exceed our long-term ROA target of about 115 basis points in the short to medium term. However, over time, we expect higher risk management costs and lower average fee rates to cause our ROA to migrate to the long-term target level. Slide 8 presents our Annuity sales. Total Annuity sales in the quarter of $1.6 billion are slightly below the year ago, but $300 million higher than last quarter. The sequential quarter increase was driven by higher HDI sales as a result of our re-pricing actions in October. Although account values of $165 billion set a new record driven by market appreciation, we continue to experience net outflows due to lower than historical sales levels and higher withdrawals. Turning to slide 9. Individual Life earnings were $98 million for the quarter, compared to $138 million a year ago. The decrease primarily reflects unfavorable claims experience and the adverse ongoing impact of the second quarter 2017 annual review and update of actuarial assumptions and other refinements. The net contribution to current quarter results from claims experience inclusive of reinsurance, associated reserve updates, and amortization was approximately $25 million less favorable than our average expectations compared to approximately $15 million more favorable than our average expectations in the year-ago quarter. We experienced a higher-than-expected level of large claim activity in the current quarter. Partially offsetting this decrease was the absence of updates to other reserve balances and related items, which negatively impacted the year-ago quarter by $25 million, and this year, a greater contribution from net investment spread results. Earnings for the current quarter included income from non-coupon investments and prepayment fees about $5 million above our average expectations. Turning to slide 10. Individual Life sales based on annualized new business premiums of $183 million were consistent with the year-ago quarter. Lower Guaranteed Universal Life sales were offset by higher sales across the other products, reflecting our product diversification strategy and specific distribution and product actions we have taken, as well as an increase in large case Variable life placements in the quarter. Turning to slide 11, Retirement earnings were $291 million for the quarter, compared to $298 million a year ago. The decrease reflects less favorable case experience and higher expenses, partially offset by a greater contribution from net investment spread results. Current quarter case experience was about $10 million less favorable than our average expectations, compared to about $10 million more favorable than average expectations a year ago. The greater contribution to net investment spread results included current quarter returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, which were about $50 million above our average expectations compared to returns about $30 million above expectations a year ago, partially offset by continued spread compression. Turning to slide 12, total Retirement gross deposits and sales were $17.1 billion for the current quarter compared to $8.9 billion a year ago. This increase was driven by gross sales of institutional investment products in the current quarter, which amounted to $10.3 billion, including roughly $4 billion of Longevity Reinsurance transactions, $3.3 billion of funded Pension Risk Transfer cases, and $3 billion of stable value wraps. Total Retirement account values were a record at $429.1 billion, up 11% from a year earlier. This increase includes the benefit for market appreciation, as well as about $8.9 billion of positive net flows over the past year split about evenly between Full Service and institutional investment products. I would highlight that the institutional net flows included about $6 billion of new funded Pension Risk Transfer cases which more than offset our runoff of the In-Force business. Turning to slide 13, Group Insurance earnings were $22 million for the quarter, compared to $43 million a year ago. The decrease reflects higher expenses, including the impact of non-linear items such as premium taxes and less favorable Group Life underwriting results, partially offset by a higher contribution from net investment spread results. Included in the current quarter underwriting result was approximately $10 million of unfavorable reserve and premium refinements. In addition, the current quarter net investment spread results included returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, which were approximately $10 million above our average expectations in comparison to returns approximately $5 million above our average expectations in the year-ago quarter. Turning to slide 14, Investment Management earnings were $306 million for the quarter, compared to $224 million a year ago. The increase in earnings was driven by a $70 million greater contribution from Other Related Revenues as a result of higher incentive fees and stronger strategic investing results. The earnings contribution of Other Related Revenues is inherently variable since it reflects changing valuations and the timing of transactions and amounted to $92 million in the current quarter, about $60 million above the average of the trailing 12 quarters. In addition, higher asset management fees net of related expenses reflect a 7% increase in average assets under management, driven by fixed income net inflows and equity market appreciation. The Investment Management business reported $1.4 billion of net positive unaffiliated third-party flows in the quarter excluding money market activity. Net retail inflows of $1.5 billion driven by Fixed Income strategies were slightly offset by institutional net outflows driven by equities. For the year, we produced $15.7 billion of positive unaffiliated third-party net flows, another strong year for our growing Investment Management business. Moving to the International Insurance businesses and turning to slide 15, earnings for Our Life Planner business were $383 million for the quarter compared to $395 million a year ago. Excluding a $5 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, earnings decreased by $7 million from a year ago. The decrease was driven by higher expenses and less favorable policy benefits experience, partially offset by continued business growth with constant dollar Insurance revenues up by 7% from a year ago. Claims experience in the current quarter was consistent with our average expectations and in the year-ago quarter was approximately $15 million more favorable than our average expectation. In addition, the current quarter contribution from net investment spread results included returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, approximately $15 million above our average expectation. Turning to slide 16. Gibraltar Life earnings were $394 million for the quarter compared to $360 million a year ago. This increase primarily reflects more favorable policy benefits experience and continued business growth, driven by the increase in U.S. denominated product sales over the past year. Turning to slide 17. International Insurance sales on a constant dollar basis were $644 million for the current quarter, down $69 million, or 10%, from a year ago. We've experienced similar trends in both Life Planner and Gibraltar operations where sales decreased by $37 million and $32 million respectively, compared to the year-ago quarter. This decrease primarily reflects lower sales in Japan following elevated sales levels in the first half of the year. Yen-based product sales in Japan decreased by $131 million compared to the prior year due to the elevated level of sales in the first half of this year which occurred in advance of rate increases that were driven by the lower standard discount rate which was effective in the second quarter. This was partially offset by an increase in U.S. dollar denominated sales in Japan of $66 million, driven by the continued attractiveness of U.S. dollar products in the current environment, which further benefited from the introduction of new U.S. dollar Whole Life products earlier this year. As a result, 78% of sales in Japan were U.S. dollar denominated in the quarter. Sales outside of Japan were consistent with the year-ago quarter, as growth in Brazil was offset by modest declines in other markets. On a full-year basis, 2017 sales \u2013 2017 total sales of $3 billion and Japan sales of $2.5 billion were consistent with the prior year; however, with a greater mix of U.S. dollar denominated sale. Turning to slide 18. The Corporate & Other loss was $451 million for the current quarter compared to a $441 million loss a year ago. The increased loss was driven by higher expenses, including non-linear items which can fluctuate and lower investment income, net of interest costs. Partially offsetting this increase was higher income from our pension plan following our assumption updates at year-end last year. Higher expenses drove the sequential quarter increase in the loss. Of the company's $165 million overall excess of fourth quarter expenses in relation to the quarterly average for the year that I mentioned, about $70 million resides in Corporate & Other. Before I hand it over to Rob, I'd like to cover one other topic that may be on your mind, and thus wanted to address it now. The topic relates to Guaranteed Group Annuities and MetLife's disclosure that it plans to strengthen reserves to address a pool of missing annuitants. We have read MetLife's disclosures, but we don't know the specifics of their situation. In terms of our Retirement business, we take fulfilling our obligations to our customers seriously. Under our policies and procedures, we use internal and external tools and resources to locate customers. We also have policies on the development of our reserve estimates. We are comfortable with our overall reserves and that we're complying with our policies and procedures and meeting our obligations to customers. Given the size and the age of our block of business, there are inevitably some customers we can't locate for a number of reasons, but that number is small. We regularly review, test and enhance the processes and tools we use to locate customers and, over time, we expect them to continue to evolve. This issue is certainly getting a lot of attention in the market, and ultimately we could see straight \u2013 see greater standardization of what may currently be divergent practices across the industry (29:56). Now, I'll turn it over to Rob. Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thank you, Mark. Now turning to slide 19. I'm going to provide an update on key balance sheet items and financial measures. We view the RBC ratios at Prudential Insurance, or PICA and PALAC as well as the composite RBCs shown here to be important measures of our financial strength. Having said that, as we've highlighted previously, we manage our annuity risks using an economic framework that includes holding total assets to a CTE 97 level with the ability to maintain that level through moderate stresses. As a consequence, over time we may see some variability in the excess of PALAC's RBC over our target ratio. We expect that the reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% as part of the Tax Act will result in a reduction of statutory deferred tax assets and an increase in certain statutory reserves, which will adversely affect the statutory capital position of our domestic insurance companies for 2017. However, while statutory results are not yet filed, we expect that our Prudential Insurance, PALAC, and composite RBC ratios will each continue to be above our current 400% AA target as of year-end, including the estimated impacts from the Tax Act. In Japan, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life reported strong solvency margins of 893% and 935% respectfully as of September 30. These solvency margins are comfortably above our targets and we estimate that they continue to be so as of the end of the year. Looking at liquidity, leverage, and capital deployment highlights that are on slide 20, cash and liquid assets at the parent company amounted to $4.4 billion at the end of the quarter which was consistent with last quarter. Cash inflows during the quarter supported approximately $635 million of shareholder distributions which were about evenly split between dividends of $321 million and share repurchases of $313 million, and also funded debt maturities and other business operations. Our financial leverage and total leverage ratios as of year-end remained within our targets. And as John noted, we returned $2.6 billion to shareholders during the year through dividends and share repurchases and announced a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend yesterday. I would also remind investors of two items we communicated in our guidance that we expect to have a positive impact on adjusted book value in the first quarter of 2018 of roughly $1 billion. We'll implement the new accounting standard that impacts the treatment of equity investments and which will result in a reclass of net unrealized gains of approximately $900 million from AOCI to retained earnings. In addition, we intend to eliminate the one-month reporting lag in our Gibraltar operations so that Gibraltar's first quarter results reflect January through March activity. This would not result in an extra month of Gibraltar earnings in our 2018 results, but instead would essentially result in an adjustment to opening equity. Now, I'll turn it back over to John. John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thank you, Rob. Thank you, Mark. We'll now open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please proceed with your question. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi, thanks, good morning. Following the impacts of tax reform and the varying impacts to both cash taxes and GAAP effective tax rates, do you still feel comfortable with the 65% free cash flow conversion guidance? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Ryan, it's Rob. Yeah, we're comfortable that, again, on average over time, the 65% ratio of free cash flow is something that the businesses will continue to produce. If we look at the impact of tax reform, we expect cash taxes to actually be lower over the course of the next few years, primarily from not incurring U.S. taxes on repatriations from Japan and the utilization of accelerated tax credits on our U.S. taxes. So we expect most of the near-term increase in after-tax AOI resulting from tax reform to actually translate into free cash flow, even including the amortization of the one-time toll tax that we mentioned of about $500 million. Longer term, there are more variables that come into play, but we generally expect reform to be neutral or a positive to future year's cash \u2013 cash flow. And so, we remained with our guidance around the 65% free cash flow ratio. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. And then a related question on the, I believe it was on the outlook call, you stated that you expected the PICA/RBC ratio to remain above 400, even if the NAIC changes the denominator factors. Is that still the case as well? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yes, it is. So, what you saw is, two of the biggest pieces related to that came through as of year-end. So that was the reduction in the DTAs and the increasing of reserves, primarily around AAT reserves that get adjusted as a result of the lower taxes. So, those are both baked into the numbers that we'll produce as of year-end, and while we haven't published those yet, and therefore we don't want to be overly specific, we're comfortable that that number is going to come out ahead of our \u2013 or above our 400% target for AA as we're currently labeling that. The remaining piece that's a potential would represent about half of the 100 basis point decline in RBC that we had given for the totality of the impact of tax reform. When and how that actually manifests itself is still unknown, but we've assumed that a recalibration of the metrics without any adjustments going from 35 down to 21 (36:16), the impact of that is (36:20) something where we would still be able to maintain our 400% RBC using our available cash \u2013 our available capital capacity. Some of that capital capacity exists within our on-balance sheet, off-balance sheet, and earnings that we obviously generate during the course of the year as well. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Erik Bass with Autonomous. Please go ahead with your question. Erik Bass - Autonomous Research : Hi, thank you. Sticking on the topic of taxes, as you look across your U.S. businesses, how do you see tax reform affecting competitive dynamics and pricing? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Erik, this is Steve. Let me address your question. And I'll just start by saying that, as you know, we regularly review our product pricing and update key assumptions as appropriate. And there are a number of factors that we consider as part of that, tax impact being just one of them. I think the most meaningful impact from the tax reform will likely not really be derived in regard to new product sales, but rather simply from applying lower tax rates for the results of our In-Force business. For products that do, where our at issue returns do benefit from the tax reform, I think it'd be reasonable to expect that some portion of the benefits realized from that will be competed away over time. However, we see this happening over time and at varying rates of speed in our varying businesses, depending on the competitive landscape in each of those businesses. And throughout this, our primary focus will continue to be ensuring that we price our products for sustainable profitable growth. In terms of the lowering of tax rates and does that impact the value proposition that we offer to customers, we don't believe so. We believe that even at lower tax rates, our insurance solutions continue to offer a strong value proposition and help to meet our customers' financial needs. Erik Bass - Autonomous Research : Thank you. And I guess post tax reform we've also seen a number of large corporates that have announced contributions to their pension plans. And when we combine that with rising interest rates and higher PBGCs, are you seeing an increase in interest in PRT transactions, particularly amongst jumbo plan sponsors? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yes, Erik, we do see a very, very healthy pipeline at the start of the year, and it's for the reasons that you mentioned. Ability to transact is bolstered by increasing funding levels and that's driven by both an uptick in rates and the contributions that you mentioned. A significant number of plan sponsors have made contributions in 2017 to their plans and they have until September to do so and to take advantage of the lower 2017 tax rates. So, ability to transact is very strong and propensity to transact continues to be bolstered by the factors that we've mentioned before on these calls, such as rising PBGC premiums, increasing awareness of the longevity risk, and that increasing awareness being reinforced by new mortality tables. So, all of those factors around both ability and propensity to transact really make for a healthy pipeline here at the early stages of the year. Erik Bass - Autonomous Research : Great. Thank you. Operator : And the next question is from the line of Suneet Kamath with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks, good morning. Wanted to start with the VA business, in particular on the hedging program. Just given a lot of the volatility that we've seen just in the past week particularly related to volatility-related products, do you have any exposure to those products or can you talk about what you've just seen in your hedging program just recently? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Sure Suneet, it's Rob. So, first of all, big picture \u2013 this is a good story and it's consistent with the prior messaging that we've been giving around the increased stability and predictability around our Annuities business. So let me break it down into pieces. Let me talk first about the last part of your question which is the hedge performance during the course of the quarter. So, we include volatility in our hedging. We don't hedge the VICs directly, but we have options and other things and they \u2013 and so, volatility is expressed through that. Our actual breakage month-to-date for February was only around $45 million. Now I'll remind you, that's on a liability that's in excess of $9 billion. And so that's consistent with the kind of hedging efficiencies that \u2013 and effectiveness that we've been seeing in prior quarters and prior years. If you look back at the fourth quarter, the way in which we look at our effectiveness, we're at 90% or above in terms of our hedge effectiveness. So, the second piece then in terms of volatility. So obviously there are multiple pieces of volatility that you want to think about. There is a direct increase in hedge costs when volatility increases within a period. And to the extent that volatility gives rise to breakage, you have that indirect cost as well. Now, those costs are subject to the fact that one, as I noted we hedge at 2 (41:45). Recall that we have our auto-rebalance feature and that allows us \u2013 as volatility is typically associated with declining markets, we're rebalancing out of equities and into fixed income. And so our exposure to that is declining as markets increase in volatility and decline. In terms of the broader, then, impact of vol on our earnings, the long-term cost of our hedging is included in our AOI. That's the AP factor that we set upfront when we look at our fees and we anticipate how much of that is going to flow into AOI as opposed to what's needed in order to settle out the liability. The period costs, in any given period the plus or the minus, is part of how we define breakage in that period. So, if volatility goes up and the cost of our hedging goes up, that's going to be defined in our breakage. And then, to the extent that we have any inefficiencies, that will be in there as well. That gets amortized into our AOI via changes in our benefit ratios. And to-date, that's actually been a positive number and it's contributed modestly to the elevated ROAs that we've been reporting. And so as part of our guidance, I'll remind you that what we did is we said that we were expecting that that mid to 125-ish ROA would migrate down over time as we took the opportunity of relatively high equity markets and high profitability coming out of the business to recalibrate how we go about hedging our annuities book, an increase in the use of derivatives and hedges as we did that. And so we undertook that and that was fully in place by the end of the fourth quarter. And therefore, we further benefited from the fact that we had, in addition to our product hedges, a capital hedge overlay on top of that against equity market volatility. And all of that's consistent with what we've been messaging in the last four quarters around, expect a slight decline in ROA and the exchange for that is going to be less volatility in our earnings and our cash flow, which we think is a good trade, particularly given the elevated levels of both markets and our profitability. Final piece of that, equity markets : obviously if vol's up and equity markets are down, the \u2013 that \u2013 all things being considered, we rather equity markets were up : that enhances the profitability of not only the Annuities business but our other businesses as well. That \u2013 any equity market declines are ultimately reflected in our earnings through unlocking of the K factor (44:18) in our benefit ratios. But recall a couple things : One is, there's a mean reversion assumption in there and that mutes the impact of it. And because of the hedging that we do, both the product hedge and the capital hedge that I described before, we significantly offset the impact of a decline in equity markets. And that's what we've been talking about, again, over the last few quarters. We are using the higher level of earnings to reduce that volatility and then shore up our earnings and our cash flow or reduce the volatility around that. So, we do better a rising equity market, but we're well protected in downturns and expect a muted earnings impact from what we saw \u2013 the likes of what we saw in February from the combination of volatility and directions in markets. Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, that's helpful. The other follow-up I had was related to the auto-rebalance. So, the trend has been, falling equity markets and rising interest rates. And as you pointed out, I think the algorithm would shift funds into fixed income option. What happens if we sustain this type of environment, i.e., equity markets continue to drop and interest rates rise? Doesn't that auto-rebalance end up working against account value growth at some point? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: So, to the extent the auto-rebalance leaves people within \u2013 more skewed toward bonds and equities, they stay in that position until a point at which the equity markets rise and auto-balance begins to work in the other direction. So if you have an environment where equity markets remain relatively flat, they'll be in a fixed income instruments. Obviously, the duration of that fixed income fund is sort of \u2013 it's sort of a mid-range duration. I remember it specifically, five years, six years, something like that. So as interest rates rise, as they're in that over time, they'll get higher yields out of that as the yield in the \u2013 on the assets in that fund increase. Now, if equity markets further decline, obviously they're going to be protected from that because we'll continue to auto-rebalance out of equities and into fixed income. And so, they'll eventually hit a floor where further equity market declines will be \u2013 they'll be fully insulated from those kind of movements. Steve, I don't know if you want to elaborate on that. Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yeah, I'll just add a couple of points, Rob. First of all, just remember that the fixed income vehicle is a corporate bond fund, and so spreads come into play as well. But also, just a more fundamental point that we've consistently emphasized. The auto-rebalancing program is not an account value optimizer. That's not what it's about. It's about the support of our risk profile over an extended period of time and making sure that we're able to responsibly offer the benefit that we do in our product design. So that's really the underlying and fundamental purpose that we very much discuss with our customers' about the auto-rebalancing program. It's not meant to optimize account values. Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, thanks. Operator : And the next question is from the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Morning. First question just on the Investment Management business and some of the incentive and transaction fees, or the strategic fees you mentioned. Can you discuss the timing of those and if you have any kind of visibility that they will remain elevated for some period here in 2018? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Alex, it's Steve. I'll address your question. First of all, incentive and performance fees often do have some seasonality. It's not unusual to see them emerge in the fourth quarter, if we've earned them. In terms of what happened this quarter, we saw those elevated incentive fees actually across multiple asset classes : we saw it in fixed income, both public and private; we saw it in real estate; and we saw it in our equity businesses as well. Over time, we have been drawing increasing flows to strategies that do carry incentive fees and that's particularly true in our fixed income business. So, it would not be unusual to see a growth in the strategies over time and possibly emergence of greater incentive fees in our earnings patterns over time. Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And follow-up question on Individual Annuities. The surrenders and withdrawals kind of ticked up a bit more than in previous quarters. Is that a trend that you'd expect to escalate? Are there any things you're doing on the sales front relatedly to maybe offer products that don't require rebalancing or things like that that you'd expect to help sales and offset some of the outflow? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Alex, again, I'll address your questions. It is not at all surprising for us to see elevated lapses and withdrawals in this quarter. I'd mention a couple of things. First of all, just in terms of the market conditions, we expect to see elevated lapses in our \u2013 as interest rates rise. And interest rates rising is usually associated with alternative solutions becoming available that clients may go into. I would also recall that that correlation of rising interest rates is built into how we manage our actuarial assumptions in the business and our risk management in the business. So, that kind of dynamic relationship between rising interest rates and lapsation is really built into what we do. On a longer term basis, I'd also recall that as more and more of our In-Force business emerges from a surrender period, we would expect to see that. In terms of new product design, we just last week launched a fixed-index annuity product. And so, we see that as offering a fuller suite of product designs to our distribution partners and their clients and we have other products in the course of this year that we expect to introduce into the marketplace. Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks for the answers. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC : Good morning, Steve, another one for you just on the auto-rebalance Highest Daily value product. I just want to make sure I understand the dynamics that are happening with it and the way the product works, again. So, correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding is the vast majority of your portfolio has the Highest Daily feature. If equity markets decline over 10%, the auto-rebalance kicks in and I think fully moves into fixed income or largely moves into fixed income at down 20 (51:58). Is that the way the product works? And just a related question, how do you \u2013 would you have to respond and start altering your hedge program with a pretty big asset reallocation? And what would that do to your ROA in the scenario that the market continues to weaken? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Tom, I'll address your question. The activation of the auto-rebalancing program is not based on overall certain level of market decline. Actually, auto-rebalancing would, under normal circumstances, kick in well before a 10% market decline. Again, to emphasize, the auto-rebalancing program is driven by our evaluation of the risk profile in each and every one of our HDI products and then the aggregation of that change in risk profile of all those individual contracts. That's what drives auto- rebalancing activity : change in risk profile of each and every contract. As to the asset reallocation topic, maybe I'd ask Rob to comment on that Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yeah. So, a couple things, Tom. First, just to put some numbers on Steve's point, if you \u2013 if we look at what happened in February, so the big movement on the 5th of February, we were down about 4%. It was a little over a $500 million transfer in the auto-rebalance out of equities into fixed income as a result of that movement. So, well before we hit the 10%. But again, put that in the context of a $9 billion overall liability and you sort of get some sense for how that works. With respect to your return on asset \u2013 the implications on the returns on assets is sort of what I was going through before, Tom, is it actually \u2013 that in and of itself would not \u2013 the algorithm, the rebalancing in and of itself is not going to change the ROA that we're getting out of the business. Recall first that the fees are charged on the guaranteed value, and so, therefore to the extent that we're in fixed income or otherwise, or markets move down, our fees are not diminished by virtue of that. And then secondly, the fact that we actually have less hedging cost, just like if we had more hedging costs, we're going to look at that as being periodic and we have a longer-term view of what the hedging costs would be over the life of the contract, and absent changing that, those \u2013 that interim, in that particular case, lower hedging costs if we're more in fixed income than equities, is something that we're going to amortize in over the life of the contract. So, we'd have probably a modest positive impact in terms of less hedging costs than what we've built in, but not material in any way and not highly volatile either. And I'm sorry, was there another part to your question, Tom? Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC : No, that was good, Rob. That did it on VA. And then just my follow-up is, just on the topic of long-term care, I know it's something that you all took a charge on several years back, I'm going to say maybe four years ago or five years ago. Just out of curiosity, do you still have, after that charge, just based on your experience to-date, is there still margin there? Is that something we should be watching out for from a development standpoint, 2018-2019? Can you comment a bit about what you're seeing on ongoing trend there? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yeah, so let me share a couple observations, Tom. First, let me start with the caveat that our book here is a relatively small book. So, we've got 215,000 policies, 6 billion in reserves, and you can kind of put that in the context of others in the industry that are much more significantly in this product. A couple other things I'd also mention just to sort of lay out the nature of our book. We're \u2013 it's a more recent vintage book, Tom, so that's when plan designs got more conservative. And about two-thirds of the book is Group as opposed to Individual. And, again, the plan designs were more conservative in the Group long-term care policies than they were in the Individual. With respect to our assumptions, we look at those every year. So, yeah, we did the big assumption update in 2012 and had the GAAP loss recognition event. I think that's what you're referring to. But every year we continue to look at that. And the assumptions that we have in place for that book, we look at both with regard to our own experience and with regard to industry experience and we are in line, if not generally on the more conservative end of that industry experience that's available to us. Now, I'd throw a caveat in there, and that is that our book is relatively nascent as I mentioned, so it's got \u2013 a little over 1% of the book is actually in payout at this point in time. And I'd say the same thing of the industry, which is that the experience of people is still evolving and that we all have to watch for how that experience may change, what we've currently seen. So, while assumptions may reflect experience to-date, that's not to say that experience can't change as more and more of the book goes from the deferred status to active status. And then, so get to your very specific question, we have a cushion above our loss recognition that's in excess of $500 million, and so we feel pretty comfortable with that level of cushion with the realization that we'll constantly be updating our assumptions. And we'll look to do that in the second quarter of next year. Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Thanks, Rob. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan: Hi, good morning. I had a couple of questions. The first one, just on the VA business. Your surrender has picked up significantly and I realize the book is aging, but they did pick up noticeably from the previous quarter. So, what drove that and what's your outlook for just withdraw rates in general in the VA business? And then secondly, just on international agent count. So, Gibraltar, the agent count I think was down a little bit sequentially. Japan Life plan are declined as well. Is that more seasonality or is it something else going on? And your outlook for that as well. Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Jimmy, it's Steve. I'll answer the first part of your question. As I mentioned, in a rising interest rate environment, we would expect to see withdrawals and lapses in the variable annuities business. Rising interest rates are usually associated with the emergence of alternative solutions, and thus it would be only natural to see increased lapsation in that for that reason in addition to the emergence from surrender charges, as you mentioned, as a longer term trend. And again, I just mentioned that we have thoroughly incorporated that correlation into our actuarial and risk management underpinnings for this business. The assumptions we make call for a dynamic relationship between direction of interest rates and lapsation. Charlie F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Jimmy, it's Charlie. Let me talk about both Life Planners and then, as you mentioned, Life Consultants. So, in Life Planners, in Japan they were up 3%, but to your point, you are correct. There is some seasonality with regard to Life Planners. So, recall that transfers to sales managers generally happen twice a year, in the second quarter and the fourth quarter, and we had a very \u2013 we had a high number of LPs transferred this quarter, resulting in an increase in sales managers year-over-year by 11%. Now, that's good because these new sales managers will contribute to future recruits and continued LP growth. But they do lower the current LP count. We also had a higher number of secondees that were transferred to the bank channel. So there are a lot of ins and outs, especially in the second and fourth quarter, but the long-term average for POJ and, frankly, for Life Planners in general is about 2% to 4%. So if you look over a five-year period for all of Prudential International Insurance, the LP growth rate in total has been about 2% or so. So, slow and steady growth of 2% over the long-term is what you should anticipate. Now, with the Life Consultant count, that's a bit of a different story. So the Life Consultant count decreased by about 6% year-over-year, and this is due to the adherence of more stringent validation and recruiting processes that we put into effect and that we talked about last quarter. And that really has a double effect. The first is that there are more terminations from stringent validation requirements that are being enforced, but also with higher recruiting standards, you have less recruits. And it's tough to do this, because when you elect to do this, there's a bit of a J-curve of sorts. So while we were flat versus prior quarter, we're not yet at the bottom of the J-curve. And I think we said last quarter, it'll take really most of this year to get to the bottom. But we think we'll hit the bottom later this year, and it's exactly what we've done in several operations outside of Japan over the past eighteen months including Korea and Taiwan, going back to the basics and increasing the quality of the field. Now a proof point to what we're doing is the fact that while LC count, the Life Consultant count decreased by 6%, sales only decreased by 4% in this market. And therefore, what you'd expect to see and what you're seeing especially at first is that as you take off essentially the bottom of the Life Consultants, if you will, the ones that aren't performing well, you'd expect to see sales go down less than the Life Planner count. And that's exactly what we saw. That won't happen every quarter, but we did expect to see it in the first quarter and that's what we saw. Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan: Thank you. Alan Mark Finkelstein - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Shannon, we have time for one more call \u2013 question. Operator : And the final question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Please proceed with your question. Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC : Thank you for taking my questions. A question on Investment Management. So, the fee rates has been pretty stable to slightly improving and part of it I believe is from the mix shift towards the fixed income. I guess at a high-level, like, how much better is your average fee rates for your inflows versus your average fee rates for your outflows? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Humphrey, it's Steve. I'll address your question. We've seen secular pressure on fees in the Investment Management industry overall. And actually, that's been not just in the active space, but also in the passive space. There's been considerable fee compression. In the face of that, we've been able to keep actually pretty stable fees overall in our book. Now \u2013 and to address your question, rather than speak about the fee rate on outflows versus fee rate on inflows, I'd point out, we have not been immune in all portions of our platform to fee compression. That's not where our stable fee rate comes from. We've experienced that fee compression in various parts of our platform, in particular, in retail portions. However, we have been able to draw flows into higher fee-yielding strategies in \u2013 particularly in fixed income, as you mentioned, and in other areas as well such as real estate. So given the multi-manager model and given our ability to draw flows into a variety of strategies, including ones that yield higher fees, we feel well positioned to compete even in this period of secular pressure on fees. Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC : Got it. And then just a follow-up question to Tom's earlier question on long-term care. So you mentioned there's 6 billion for reserves. Is that GAAP or Stat? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: That was Stat. Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC : Okay, and then would the reserves be kind of similar to the split between the Group and the Individual side, one-third/two-thirds, or how should we think about that? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: So remember the size of the book is \u2013 yeah, if you look at the two-thirds versus one-third that would be probably a pretty good indicator. I don't have the number off the top of my head, Humphrey, but I think it's \u2013 we'll have someone follow up with you specifically, but I would think about it being roughly that order of magnitude, because they're both relatively nascent books. Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC : Okay, got it. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

LLC John Bakewell Barnidge - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Prudential First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to our host, Mr. Mark Finkelstein. Please go ahead, sir. Alan Mark Finkelstein - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thank you, Brad. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today's call are John Strangfeld, CEO; Mark Grier, Vice Chairman; Charlie Lowrey, Head of International Businesses; Steve Pelletier, Head of Domestic Businesses; Rob Falzon, Chief Financial Officer, and Rob Axel, Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by John, Mark and Rob, and then we will answer your questions. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of such measures to the comparable GAAP measures and a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, please see the section titled forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures of our earnings press release, which can be found on our website at investor.prudential.com. And with that, I will hand it over to John. John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thank you, Mark. Good morning and thank you for joining us. We had a good start to the year. Earnings were solid and the underlying momentum across our businesses remained strong. In my remarks, I will cover three main topics. I'll provide a high-level perspective on earnings, discuss our business fundamentals, and then cover capital deployment. And after that, I'll hand it over to Mark and Rob to go through the specifics. I'll start my comments on the results for the first quarter. Adjusted operating earnings of $3.05, which excludes a $0.03 benefit from market-driven and discrete items, exceeds the $2.76 we reported in the prior year quarter. Annualized return on equity on the same basis was very good, in the mid-13% range, which is above our near to intermediate term target of 12% to 13%. There were a number of moving parts at the segment level that Mark will walk through, but at a high level, earnings are benefiting from solid core growth in our asset-based businesses, including Investment Management, Retirement and Individual Annuities. We also saw improved margins in our Group Insurance business and steady underlying results in our international operations. In addition, tax reform is an incremental positive to results and we experienced lower than normal corporate expenses in the quarter, which we know will vary. Partially offsetting these items, investment returns and spread income were lower than the prior year and below our normal expectations, due mainly to less favorable non-coupon and prepayment investment results. In addition, year-over-year comparisons are impacted by lower expectations in Individual Life Insurance as a result of last year's second quarter actuarial updates. I would also highlight that we experienced mixed underwriting results across the segments, which is not uncommon to see in the first quarter. However, the positive and negatives largely offset and the net impact on results was relatively modest. In particular, the adverse mortality experienced in Individual Life Insurance and to a lesser extent our Life Planner business was largely offset by favorable case experience in our Retirement business and good Group Life and Disability experience. While we don't expect this to match precisely every quarter, we manage our mix of mortality and longevity businesses such that they will work well together and contributed to dampening earnings volatility. Before turning to business fundamentals, I'd also like to observe that net income for the quarter was fairly consistent with operating earnings. Credit losses were muted and a number of the recent actions to reduce earnings volatility are having their intended impact. In addition, our variable annuities hedging program showed good results in a particularly volatile quarter for capital markets. Strong net income is also contributing to solid growth in adjusted book value per share, which is up 15% over the prior quarter. While this increase reflects the impacts of tax reform and accounting changes at the start of 2018, it also reflects strong bottom line results. I'll now turn to business fundamentals. At a high level, we continue to see solid momentum. While first quarter sales inflows were influenced by the timing of transactions and other episodic factors, looking through those we are pleased with the overall production trends in our operations. In our domestic businesses, we're seeing increasing sales momentum in our Individual Annuities business, with sales up 20% over the prior year and 7% sequentially. Likewise, we're seeing strong sales in our Group Insurance business, which reported growth of 27% over the prior year. This includes the benefits of our financial wellness value proposition as well as success expanding our presence in the premier market or accounts with 100 to 5,000 lives. Investment Management also had a good growth quarter, although the extent of the strength is not reflected in the published net flow number. Results were distorted by an institutional outflow relating to a very low fee legacy index account. And this large $6 billion outflow was more than offset by about $7 billion of higher value new assets. And given the excellent investment performance of our funds, we remain upbeat that net flow story will continue to be a positive one. We did experience net outflows in our Retirement business. While full service had solid sales in net flows, we did not close any pension risk transfers in the quarter. Pension risk transfer transactions are episodic, and we have seen a recent trend where activity builds throughout the year. So, having said that, we have a healthy pipeline and believe our leading market position and strong execution track record will lead to continued strength in this business. Our international businesses continue to show good overall momentum. Although sales were down from the prior year, this is mainly due to challenging comparisons, as the first quarter of 2017 benefited from a sales surge in Japan ahead of our repricing of yen-based products. Looking through that impact, sales were solid, led by good Life Planner and Life Consultant productivity, and we continue to see particularly strong sales results in our U.S. dollar products in Japan. With regard to capital deployment, we returned $760 million to shareholders, about equally split between dividends and share repurchases. This reflects the quarterly impact of the 20% increase in both our share repurchase authorization and dividend level for 2018. We continue to generate a considerable amount of free cash flow in our businesses and thoughtfully allocate our excess capital between investing in our businesses and returning capital to our shareholders all the while maintaining a strong financial position. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark. Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thank you, John. Good morning, good afternoon, or good evening. Thank you for joining our earnings call today. I'll take through our results and then I'll turn it over to Rob Falzon who will cover liquidity leverage and capital highlights. I'm starting on slide 2. After tax adjusted operating income amounted to $3.08 per share for the quarter compared to $2.79 a year ago. After adjusting for market-driven and discrete items of $0.03 per share, which consist of our quarterly market and experience unlockings in the Annuities business, EPS amounted to $3.05 for this quarter, up from $2.76 a year ago, and implying an ROE of 13.6% on an annualized basis. Core performance of our businesses overall was solid in the quarter, with year-over-year comparisons benefiting from higher fees in our Annuities and Investment Management businesses, and continued business growth in International Insurance on a constant currency basis, including the impact of seasonally higher earnings from the elimination of Gibraltar Life's one-month reporting lag. In addition, a lower effective tax rate benefited earnings in the quarter as compared to prior year results. While underlying business performance was solid, I would highlight that current quarter results included a couple of items that we refer to as trend considerations or items that varied from our average expectations. This includes non-coupon investment returns and prepayment income which were about $50 million below our average expectations in the quarter. In addition, our Individual Life Insurance business had about $20 million of reserve true-ups in the quarter. As John mentioned, overall mortality experience was in line with our expectations, as positives and negatives largely offset across segments. The net impact of these items resulted in a negative impact to current quarter earnings of approximately $0.14 per share. GAAP net income, which included amounts categorized as realized investment gains and losses and results from divested businesses was $1.4 billion in the quarter and was relatively consistent with our after tax adjusted operating income despite significant market volatility. Moving to slide 3, which shows the items affecting pre-tax net income that are not included in adjusted operating income. Our current quarter GAAP net income includes pre-tax net realized investment gains of $64 million and a pre-tax loss on divested business results and other items of $66 million. Three items to note. Product-related embedded derivatives and associated hedging had a positive impact of $340 million, largely driven by the noneconomic impact of applying wider credit spreads in the calculation of our non-performance risk related to the annuities living benefits. The loss of $269 million from risk management activities was primarily driven by currency hedges, as the U.S. dollar weakened compared to certain other currencies, as well as by losses on derivatives used for asset and liability management and other risk mitigation activities. The $81 million loss from divested businesses primarily relates to the impact of higher rates on our derivatives used for asset and liability duration management in our Long-Term Care business. Underwriting results were largely as expected. Moving to our business results and starting on slide 4, I will discuss the comparative results for each segment, excluding market-driven and discrete items. Annuities earnings were $503 million for the quarter, up by $54 million from a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by a greater contribution from policy charges and fee income, reflecting a 6% increase in our variable annuity average separate account values and lower risk management costs. Partially offsetting this increase was a lower contribution from net investment spread results as returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees were approximately $5 million below expectations in the current quarter compared to $15 million above expectations a year ago. Annuities return on assets, or ROA, of 121 basis points is down modestly from the fourth quarter, primarily due to lower returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees in the quarter. As we have previously stated, our long-term ROA target is about 115 basis points and we expect to exceed this level in the short to medium term. Over time, we expect that higher risk management costs and the aging of our business will cause our ROA to migrate to the long-term target level. I would also highlight that our variable annuity hedging program was well over 90% effective in what was a very volatile quarter. Slide 5 presents our Annuity sales. Total Annuity sales in the quarter of $1.7 billion were 20% higher than the year-ago quarter and 7% above the prior sequential quarter. The increase was primarily driven by higher HDI sales as the current interest rate environment enabled us to increase the attractiveness of our products. Turning to slide 6, Individual Life had a soft quarter as earnings of $36 million were $82 million lower than the year-ago quarter and well below our expectations. I'll focus my comments on items in the quarter that deviated from what we would ordinarily expect. There were three items I will highlight, each having a negative impact on current quarter results. First, our claims experience, inclusive of reinsurance, associated reserve updates and amortization was approximately $45 million less favorable than expected. While we typically experience higher claims in the first quarter, claims this quarter were higher than typical seasonality. Notably, we experienced a higher frequency of claims in older age bands. Second, we experienced adverse impacts from reserve true-ups of $20 million. In any given quarter, we could make modest positive and negative adjustments as we reconcile actual experience to actuarial models. The adjustments this quarter were larger than normal and skewed to the negative side. And finally, returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees were about $10 million below expectations. We believe that after adjusting for these items results would be representative of our quarterly earnings power. Turning to slide 7, Individual Life sales based on annualized new business premiums of $125 million, were $21 million lower than the year-ago quarter. As expected, guaranteed universal life sales declined and were partially offset by higher variable life and other universal life sales. This reflects our product diversification strategy and specific distribution, service, and product actions that we have taken. Turning to slide 8, Retirement earnings were $317 million for the current quarter compared to $397 million a year ago. The decrease reflects a lower contribution from net investment spread results and higher expenses, partially offset by more favorable case experience. The contribution from net investment spread results was $80 million lower than the year-ago quarter. Current quarter returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees were about $20 million below expectations compared to $65 million above expectations a year ago. In addition, while we continue to experience some spread compression, this was mitigated by an increase in the average spread-based asset balances. Current quarter results also reflect particularly strong case experience, which was about $55 million more favorable than our expectations. This modestly exceeded the prior year, which also benefited from very good case experience. Turning to slide 9, total Retirement gross deposits and sales were $10.6 billion for the current quarter, relatively consistent with the year ago. Results reflect solid full service plan sales offset by light institutional investment product sales. Net outflows for the current quarter of $2.4 billion reflect a few items I will highlight. First, there were no pension risk transfer transactions that closed in the quarter. As we've mentioned, these transactions can be lumpy, particularly given our focus on larger cases. However, we have a robust pipeline. Second, we experienced net outflows in our investment-only stable value business, driven by higher net participant withdrawals. Finally, these two items were partially offset by positive net flows in full service with good planned sales activity in the quarter, as noted previously. Total Retirement account values were $428 billion, up by 8% from a year earlier. This increase reflects the benefit from market appreciation as well as about $7 billion of positive net flows over the past year. Turning to slide 10. Group Insurance earnings were $55 million for the quarter as compared to $34 million a year ago. The increase primarily reflects more favorable underwriting results, partially offset by a lower contribution from net investment spread results and higher expenses. The current quarter total benefits ratio of 85.6% was slightly better than our long-term target range of 86% to 90%, reflecting more favorable Group Life experience, partially offset by modestly less favorable Disability experience. We continue to be pleased with the underwriting results in our Group Insurance business. Turning to slide 11, most of our Group Insurance sales occur in the first quarter, reflecting calendar year effective dates. Current quarter sales based on annualized new business premiums of $383 million were 27% higher than the year-ago quarter. This increase reflects higher sales in both Group Life and Disability. Turning to slide 12. Investment Management earnings were $232 million for the quarter, compared to $196 million a year ago. The increase in earnings was driven by higher asset management fees, net of related expenses, which reflects a 9% increase in average assets under management, driven by fixed income net inflows and equity market appreciation. Fee rates on our assets under management have remained very consistent. In addition, results reflect a $16 million higher contribution from other related revenues, which totaled $45 million in the quarter as a result of stronger strategic investing earnings and higher transaction fees. This is about $12 million above the quarterly average over the last three years. I would also highlight that earnings, excluding other related revenue, were below the prior sequential quarter. This is mainly due to the seasonality of certain revenue and expense items, including first quarter cost associated with our long-term incentive plan. The Investment Management business reported about $800 million of net positive unaffiliated third-party flows in the quarter, excluding money market activity. Net retail inflows of $1 billion, driven by fixed income strategies, were slightly offset by institutional net outflows of $200 million. As John mentioned, we had a large client withdrawal of about $6 billion tied to a very low-fee index strategy that is inconsequential to earnings. Moving now to International Insurance and turning to slide 13. Earnings from our Life Planner business were $416 million for the quarter compared to $408 million a year ago. The increase was driven by continued business growth with constant dollar insurance revenues up by 8% from a year ago, partially offset by a lower contribution from net investment spread results and higher expenses. The current quarter contribution from net investment spread results included returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees approximately $5 million below our average expectations, in comparison to $10 million above expectations in the year-ago quarter. Claims experience was approximately $15 million less favorable than expected in both the current and prior period. I would also highlight that a concentration of annual mode revenues results in an earnings pattern that favors the first quarter. We estimate that this benefited current quarter results by about $25 million in relation to the quarterly average. Turning to slide 14, Gibraltar Life earnings were $440 million for the quarter, compared to $391 million a year ago. This increase reflects seasonally higher earnings, which were previously reported in the second quarter, now reflected in the first quarter due to the elimination of the one-month reporting lag. We would estimate that the benefit to current quarter earnings from a shift in the concentration of annual mode revenues was about $25 million. In addition, current quarter results benefited from more favorable policy benefits experience and business growth, primarily from strong U.S. dollar product sales in all channels. These increases were partially offset by a lower contribution from net investment spread results with returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees, approximately $10 million below expectations, in comparison to $5 million above expectations in the year ago quarter. Turning to slide 15, International Insurance sales on a constant dollar basis were $745 million for the current quarter, down by $149 million or 17% from a year ago. This decrease primarily reflects lower sales in Japan and is largely tied to the elevated level of sales that occurred in the year ago quarter. You may recall that we experienced a sales acceleration in advance of the repricing of recurring premium yen products a year ago. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in U.S. dollar-denominated sales in Japan, driven by the continued attractiveness of U.S. dollar products in the current environment and the introduction of new U.S. dollar products last year. 79% of sales in Japan were U.S. dollar denominated in the quarter. Sales outside of Japan were lower. This reflects lower sales in Korea as the year ago quarter had large Annuity sales in advance of tax revisions on savings products. This was partially offset by growth in Brazil where business drivers remain strong. Turning to slide 16, the Corporate & Other loss was $294 million for the current quarter compared to a $352 million loss a year ago. The decrease was primarily driven by lower expenses, in particular non-linear items, which can fluctuate including lower cost for employee benefit and compensation plans which are tied to equity market returns. In addition, higher income from the qualified pension plan following our assumption updates at year-end last year was partially offset by lower net investment income. As we've seen in the past, Corporate & Other results can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of expense items. We would consider the loss this quarter to be smaller than what we would typically expect. Now I'll turn it over to Rob. Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thank you, Mark. Now turning to slide 17, I'll provide an update on key balance sheet items and financial measures. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company amounted to $5.1 billion at the end of the quarter. The increase of about $700 million from year-end was driven primarily by proceeds from our $1 billion senior debt issuance in March, partially offset by operating needs within our businesses. Cash inflows from the businesses during the quarter supported approximately $760 million of shareholder distributions. This was about evenly split between dividends of $387 million and share repurchases of $375 million done under our $1.5 billion board authorization for the year. Our financial leverage and total leverage ratios remained within our targets as of the end of the first quarter. The year-end 2017 RBC ratios at Prudential Insurance or PICA and PALAC as well as the composite RBC are also shown here. As we have highlighted previously, we manage our Annuity risks using an economic framework that includes holding total assets to a CTE 97 level with the ability to maintain that level through moderate stresses. As a consequence, over time we may see some significant variability in the excess of PALAC's RBC ratio over our target ratio. At December 31, 2017, our domestic and international regulatory capital ratios were above our AA financial strengths targeted levels and we continued to be well positioned relative to these objectives as of March 31, 2018. I would also remind investors of two items we communicated in our guidance and during our fourth quarter earnings call that had a positive impact on adjusted book value in the first quarter of 2018 of roughly $1 billion. First, we implemented the new accounting standard, which impacts the treatment of equity investments and resulted in a reclass of net unrealized gains of approximately $900 million from AOCI to retained earnings. In addition, we eliminated the one-month reporting lag in our Gibraltar operations, so that Gibraltar's first quarter results reflect January through March activity. This did not result in an extra month of Gibraltar earnings, but instead resulted in an adjustment to opening equity of approximately $170 million. And with that, I'll turn it back over to John. John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thanks, Rob, thanks, Mark. We would like to now open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. First question in queue will come from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Erik Bass - Autonomous Research : Hi, good morning. Thank you. I guess first, given the renewed concerns on Long-Term Care in the industry, can you just comment on the reserve levels and assumptions in your legacy block and the recent claims trends that you've seen? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Sure, Erik, it's Rob. So, a couple of thoughts. One let me sort of just sort of set the stage with the characterization of our block. It is a relatively small block. We've got about 214,000 policies. Our reserves, to the point of your question, are $6.2 billion statutory, and that's about 7% of our overall statutory reserves. The nature of our book is a relatively recent vintage, and therefore, it benefits from more conservative plan designs than what we've seen in across the industry. Also notable is that two-thirds of our book are group issued, which also tend to have more conservative plan designs, for instance, lower percentages of things like lifetime benefits and inflation benefits. So, when we look at the reserving of that, it's a relatively small book. We feel pretty comfortable with the level of that reserve. And given that our assumptions are consistent with industry peers and generally on the more conservative side. Now, we recognize that only about 2% of our book is in payout, and the industry is also relatively nascent in terms of its experience and the emergence of that experience. So, obviously, as data emerges we and others will have to reflect that data vis-\u00e0-vis the assumptions that we're making. And period results as a result of that as well, any given period you're going to see volatility in that, which we think you saw in 2017 versus what we experienced in 2018. So, our results for 2017 were negative with regard to our underwriting results, but in 2018 in the first quarter, as Mark indicated in his opening remarks, were largely in-line with our expectations. We update our assumptions every year in the second quarter, so we'll be moving into that process. As I mentioned in the last call, we have about $0.5 billion of margins in our reserves in that Long-Term Care block. So, given the size of the block, given the composition of the block, given the margin we have, we believe that we're very well-positioned going into the second quarter process to absorb changes, if any, that might come out of our review of assumptions in that period of time. Erik Bass - Autonomous Research : Thank you. That's helpful. And just don't know if you can provide any further drilling down into the assumptions, which you characterized as conservative relative to peers. But any detail you can provide there in terms of whether it's mortality, morbidity, or interest rate assumptions? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: So, we haven't provided any details on that and sort of breaking that out separately, and the way those assumptions work, Erik, calling out any individual assumption without the context of the overall assessment of those assumptions is sort of a very difficult thing to do, but we benefit from industry studies. We look at those studies and we look at our own experience and I think it's very safe to say that we're across each and every one of those dimensions we would consider ourselves to be on the mid to more conservative end of the spectrum of how others have estimated those things. Erik Bass - Autonomous Research : Got it, thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi, thanks, good morning. Somewhat similar but not specific to Long-Term Care, but just as we approach the second quarter actuarial assumption review, anything we should be thinking about in terms of key model updates or anything of that nature that you can help us think about as we move into that? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: So, Ryan, obviously, can't really comment on what's coming into the second quarter, given that that process is just kicking off. The only observations I would make is that we have \u2013 as we indicated last year, when we talked about, we did have significant impacts as a result of model changes that we were implementing as a result of what we called our actuarial transformation process that we were undertaking. And that modeling, with respect to valuations, was largely completed during the course of last year. So, we don't have an issue where we're looking at significant outcomes as a result of having done major revamps to modeling. That's probably the only insight I could offer at this point. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: No, that's helpful. Thanks. And then just on the PRT pipeline, I think you mentioned looks pretty good. But can you provide some additional color as we move through the year on PRT? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Ryan, it's Steve Pelletier, I'll answer that question. As Mark mentioned in his opening comments, it's not unusual to see transaction activity build over the course of the year. That's especially true in the very large case market, in which we specialize in that segment of the market, seeing companies develop their approaches and their transaction plans over the course of a fiscal year is not at all unusual, and it's in fact what we've seen over the past few years. But I would echo some of the comments I've made in the immediate past. We see a very robust visible pipeline. That pipeline continues to be driven by some of the considerations we've spoken about. A rising interest rate environment helps improve funding status. And so, across the board, ability of plan sponsors to transact is enhanced. And propensity to transact still remains very strong, driven by considerations like rising PBGC premiums and increased awareness of the longevity risk inherent in their plans. So, we like what we see in terms of the visible pipeline and we think that we also like our ability to compete within that pipeline and as that pipeline emerges, really driven again by the same considerations that have driven our business in the past. The quality of our overall effort, the ability to bring large and complex transactions to a successful close, and the ability to onboard large populations of annuitants in a very seamless fashion. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great, thanks a lot. Operator : Okay. And we will go to the line of John Nadel with UBS. Please go ahead. John M. Nadel - UBS: Hey, good morning, everybody. Two questions. One on PALAC, and the risk-based capital ratio there, Rob, is it fair for us to think that a roughly 1,000% RBC ratio is equivalent to CTE 97? Or would that just be a poor relationship to try to draw? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Well, I get the direction you're going. And what I'd modify on what you said, John, is that the way we manage that block is not just to a CTE 97, but the phrase we've used is through the cycle. John M. Nadel - UBS: Understood, yeah. Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yeah. So it's our ability to maintain that not only today but through an adverse economic cycle, equity markets being down like 17%, interest rates popping up. So, if you think about that, it's that CTE 97 under a level of duress. John M. Nadel - UBS: Okay. So, in a more benign environment, it's above CTE 97? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yep, absolutely. John M. Nadel - UBS: And, so again, around 1,000%, is that the place to think about or is it something below this level? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: No, part of the challenge you have with it, John, is that that is a very volatile measure because, without getting into sort of the inside baseball of how this all works, there's a lot of volatility between capital and reserves because they're calculated differently. And the way that ratio works is that it tends to mute the volatility when you're down around 350-ish (35:11) or so, but when you're above 350 (35:15), depending on what's happening in the market, it affects capital differently than it affects reserves. And so you get lots of volatility above that level. So, it's really hard to read too much into the ratio when it's that high. It's much cleaner to look at it when it's actually closer to the sort of the targeted level. Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: And the concept is more a total asset requirement, which combines both capital and reserves. And the way the liability side changes in terms of the mix is still supported by the asset position. John M. Nadel - UBS: Okay. I appreciate that color. Thanks. And then I think I have one more for Charlie. I understand the fact that Life Planner sales in Japan in the year-ago period certainly benefited from some accelerated sales ahead of some pricing changes. I was curious about the Life Planner sales outside of Japan or rest of world that were down 12% year-over-year. Was there a similar impact anywhere that affected that comparison? Charlie F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.: There was actually in Korea, there was a similar effect in terms after a surge in anticipation of a tax rate change on variable products. So, you had the same thing happen there. Other than that you had goo sales in Brazil and other places, but there was a similar factor outside and that's what caused the decrease. John M. Nadel - UBS: Okay. Thank you. Charlie F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yep. Operator : And we'll go to the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC : Good morning. Just a few follow-up questions on Long-Term Care. Rob, the 8% margin on Long-Term Care, is that for GAAP or stat? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: The 8% margin... John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: The $500 million on.... Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC : Yeah, the $500 million. Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Oh I'm sorry... John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: $500 million is what he is... Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yeah. So I'm sorry, that's a GAAP cushion, the statutory cushion is in excess of Tom. Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC : Got you. And do you have the stats about differential between GAAP and stat reserves I think you said $6.2 billion was stat? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yes, the statutory reserves are $6.2 billion, GAAP reserves are about $5 billion. But recall on the GAAP side you're holding equity in addition to the reserves, so the way that works, if we look at our statutory reserves, we look at the GAAP and the dealt delta has to be filled by equity. So, you've got $2.5 billion of equity in addition to reserves sitting in GAAP where you have a lower level of equity in your statutory statements. Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC : Got you. And then can you provide a little bit of color around the increase in incurred Long-Term Care claims in 2017? I know you described it as adverse. It was a fairly big delta, just if you could give some color on what drove it. Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Sure, so a couple of thoughts. I've mentioned before about the size of the book. And so as a result of the size of the book, the size of the claims that you get in any given period in a year are going to be relatively small and therefore volatile as well, Tom, so we had like 1,800, 1,900 claims during the entire year, which represents well less than 1% of our policies outstanding. So, you take underwriting results which can be volatile in and of themselves and then you take a small sample size which can be volatile and you just had a compounding volatility. And so specifically, what we saw last year is that the claims had a disproportionate representation of lifetime benefits or sort of a more generous benefit packages vis-\u00e0-vis our book. So, our book has got less than 10% lifetime benefits. But the claims last year were like 1.5% ex that. So, it's sort of not proportional to what the book would otherwise be. And so if you just think about our incidents, our claim was only up about 7%. That's kind of natural given as the book matures, claims are going to climb over time, but the severity vis-\u00e0-vis of prior year was up like \u2013 in excess of 20% and that represents that nicks that came through which we don't think is anything systemic. We think that's just \u2013 it's just small sampling and volatility just given the profile of our book. And in fact if you look at the first quarter, part of what drove the operating results being profitable in the Long-Term Care book was in fact a movement back toward a reversion to closer to the average that we have in the book as opposed to what we saw last year. Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC : Got it. That's really helpful. Yeah. Because, when you looked at the incurred claims I think they were up over 50% but the actual incidents was up only 7%. So is the right way to interpret that the way those filings work it's the expectation of ultimate claims so that would be like a claim duration issue because of the lifetime benefit connection, that's what really drove that? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yeah. Absolutely. So, an estimate would be based on the characteristics of the policy and to the extent it's a more generous policy, it's going to have a larger reserve associated with it. Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC : Thanks, and then one final one. Long-Term Care riders on life insurance policies, is that driving any of the weakness you're seeing on the life insurance reserving and/or claims experience there? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Tom, this is Steve. No, that has no impact on what you saw this quarter with the reserves. Those are true-ups that as Mark said in his opening comments, they all tended to go against us, so a bunch of relatively small items, but in the aggregate we felt it was worth calling them out. Those are items that as recently as last quarter, several of them went in our favor, so they can vary from quarter-to-quarter, but they don't have anything to do with the rider characteristics on our Life business. Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Thanks. Operator : And our next question will come from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. First just a question on your variable annuity sales. The sales have been picking up a little bit, but withdrawals have increased as well. And just wondering if that's because of the aging of the book or if there's something else going on and how that affects your views of net flows in the Annuity business over the next couple of years? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Jimmy, it's Steve. I'll address your question first addressing sales. We did have a solid pickup in sales year-over-year. I'd say that's characterized by a couple of things. First of all, there's generally improving sentiment in the distribution markets around Department of Labor fiduciary rule outcomes and that certainly helps on an overall basis. In our particular case, we were also able to make some judicious and measured enhancements to the competitiveness of our products in ways that \u2013 especially HDI and PDI, in ways that contributed to first quarter sales. You will recall that we are pretty unique in our ability to make pricing changes in any direction on a monthly basis. And so, when we saw a rising rate environment over the cusp of the year and we saw the positive impact that that was having on our at-issue returns, we were able to move nimbly. And, like I say, make some measured enhancement to our product competitiveness while still writing the business at very attractive returns. So, that's on the sales side. In the aspect of the withdrawals, I think part of that is natural to the aging of the book as more of the business moves into payout phase and there's more active utilization of the benefit. I'd also say that we saw increased lapsation in this quarter. And again, that is something that is very much contemplated and anticipated in the way we manage risk in the business, in particular in our dynamic lapse function that we spoke to you about a couple of years ago. We expect to see \u2013 and Mark touched upon this in his opening comments, we expect to see rising lapses in a rising rate environment. However, I will point out we're talking about a couple of quarters now that we've seen increased lapsation. It's way too early to call some type of a trend, given the duration of the liability, but the pick-up in lapsation is not inconsistent with the way we approach the business from a risk management standpoint. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And I had a question for Charlie, as well. On sales in Japan, they've been pressured by the shift in the product portfolio towards non-yen products. Where are you in the whole process of sort of pivoting your product mix? And I guess as you lap through the difficult comps and I'm assuming that sales will begin to recover in the second half, but what's your view on that? Charlie F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.: So, Jimmy, as was said, sales were down 17%, but what we were able to do was to pivot to U.S. dollar product, right. So, sales were down, partly because of the surge that took place and partly because of the repricing of our recurring premium yen-denominated product. So, as you know, we don't really sell \u2013 we sell virtually no single-premium yen-denominated product anymore in Japan in any channel. But we do sell some recurring premium product, but we've repriced that significantly. And so, we did see a decrease in sales there, but because of the sophistication of our sales force and the channels in which we sell through, we were able to pivot such that now the U.S. dollar sales are almost 80% of total sales. So I think Steve used the word nimble before in his answer, I will use the same thing here. We have been able to pivot, both in terms of new product innovation, in terms of new dollar-denominated product, and in terms of the sophistication of the sales force in selling that product. So, we're most of the way through this, I would say, but there will be some continuing decrease in the yen-denominated product that we have. So, I think what you'll see going forward is a continued increase in U.S. dollar sales, but a leveling off of the recurring premium yen-denominated sales as well. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, thank you. Operator : And we'll go to the next question in queue will come from Sean Dargan with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Sean Dargan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks. I have a question about an item from the press release about an $81 million derivative loss linked to the LTC business. Can you give some color on what that was exactly? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Sean, it's Rob. Yeah. So, the nature of the liability within Long-Term Care is very long, it's got a very long duration. And therefore, in order for us to do proper ALM, we have to use a combination of cash instruments, treasuries, and corporates and complement that with derivatives in order to be able to extend out the duration. So, we are long interest rate swaps in the \u2013 so a net receiver interest rate swaps in that Long-Term Care portfolio. Obviously, as interest rates rise, as they did during the course of the quarter, the mark-to-market on that swap is negative. And that's the number that you're referring to. So, it's a negative mark on the duration swaps, which theoretically are being offset by a positive mark on the liability, if you sort of think about the conceptual construct there, right, any change in the value of the asset is going to be reflected in the change in the present value of that liability as well. So, that's the whole idea between ALM and doing good duration matching. Is that clear or did you have a follow up to that? Sean Dargan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : No, I think that's clear. Just sticking with hedging, with increased volatility returning, it seems like the hedge breakage was not material on the VA side in the first quarter. Just wondering if you have any qualitative comments about how you viewed slippage in the quarter? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yeah. So, just the remark that you made was sort of on point, which is that it was a very volatile quarter. We had lots of days where volatility was in excess of 1%, which was an anomaly in the quarter vis-\u00e0-vis prior periods of time. So, I think it was in excess of 20 days where we had volatility in excess of 1% and that compares to having less than 10 of those days in all of 2017. So, lots of volatility there. We have a very rigorous hedging program. The implication of that volatility is that they were trading probably twice the level of trades that they do during the day, we'd usually trade a couple of times, rebalance a couple of times during the day. They are probably rebalancing four, five, six times during the course of the day as a result of that volatility. But the end result of that was a high level of hedge efficiency. So, as Mark indicated, it was in excess of 90% and we feel good about that outcome. And so while we had negative hedge breakage, the gross number was around $149 million for the quarter. We've seen some reversion of that, as well, on actually a significantly lower level of hedge breakage on a cumulative basis from where we sit today. So, we think that program is robust. We think that protects us, not only from volatility but also from a declining equity market. So, we feel good about both the quality and earnings prospects of our Annuities book, given the number of things that we've done over the course of the years to de-risk that book of business. Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yeah, Sean, it's Mark. Just one additional comment. We have substantial technology and human resources dedicated to this hedging process. And so, when Rob talks about the capabilities that we have to rebalance within a day several times, for example, that reflects a big investment in getting this right. Sean Dargan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead. Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC : Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Regarding to your Group sales in the quarter, it was really strong. I was just wondering, what were the drivers and are you taking market share in a certain part of the market? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Humphrey, this is Steve. I would say that the strength of our Group sales is very much attributable to the strength of our financial wellness value proposition and how we see that really resonating in the marketplace. You recall we spoke about this extensively at Investor Day last year and our financial wellness effort is really about taking the capabilities that exist across all of our businesses and the digital and data analytics capabilities that we've been investing in significantly over the past few years and using those to deepen and individualize our relationships with people, individuals who come to us via the workplace channels, via our Group business and our Retirement full service business. And we see real progress in the strength of that value proposition. I'll give you an example. Again, harkening back to Investor Day, last year, we spoke about the Pathways program. You'll recall this is the program by which some of our top Prudential advisors offer financial planning and financial education seminars to individuals who are employees of our Group and Retirement clients. I think the numbers we cited for you last year were that that program was being taken up by 250 companies, who collectively employ 3 million people plus. Today, those numbers are 350 companies who collectively employ 4 million people plus. And so that type of tangible benefit that we're able to offer to individuals and their employers is really resonating in the marketplace. And I'd say that was the major driver of our pickup in Group sales. And we're pleased not just by the overall quantum of that pickup, 27%, but by the composition of it as well, as Mark mentioned. About 40% of our sales growth occurred in the premier market, 100 to 5,000 lives, where we're really trying to build our presence. So, we feel very good about Group results in the quarter. Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: This is Mark, just to add on. When we've talked about this in investor meetings, we've said that the first proof point on the wellness initiative will show up in Group sales. And I think from Steve you're hearing good early returns on that proof point. Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC : Got it. And then shifting gear to Investment Management. You talked about you have $7 billion of high fee gross inflows coming in, but offset by the $6.2 billion low fee index product. If we were to think about the fee differential between the inflows and the outflows, like how would you describe that in the current quarter? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: I would say the differential couldn't be wider, Humphrey, quite frankly given the fact that the fee basis on the single large outflow was absolutely de minimis. This was a legacy, a passive strategy, which we don't do much of at all, that was part of a larger long-standing relationship. But the fee basis on this part of the business was absolutely inconsequential. And as it relates to our inflows, they continue to come from areas such as certain components of our fixed income business and our real estate business where we are able to continually \u2013 continue to attract very reasonable fees. All of this put together means that, even in an age where there's secular pressure on the fees inherent in active asset management, we've been able to keep our average fee basis across our entire book of business very, very constant in that 22 basis point range that we've cited to you before. Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And our next question here will come from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. The first question I had was just going back to the Annuities and the total asset requirement. Could you just describe, I guess, given the net outflows and given sort of some of the stuff that's running off might be a little bit more capital intensive, how quickly is that total asset requirement declining and how much would you expect that to contribute to capital deployment? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: So, Alex, it's Rob. I think about it less in terms of sort of that capital ratio and more in terms of the operating earnings that are coming off that business and because we're as well capitalized as we are, our ability to be fairly aggressive about dividending out our earnings in the form of free cash flow out of the business. So, if you look at PALAC in our Annuities business last year, we actually took out over $1 billion worth of dividends \u2013 or dividends and returns of capital from the business. And in the first quarter we took out in excess of $300 million in dividends from that business as well. And if you sort of look at the run rate of the business on an after-tax basis, that $300 million compares to around $400 million or so of earnings that we would report in the quarter. So, we feel very good about the dynamic that occurs on the capital side allowing us to be very aggressive about dividending out earnings. Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And do you have flexibility to be sort of proactive and accelerate any of that to repurchase stock at more attractive share prices? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Well, so that's a different issue, which is how we feel about stock repurchase, so I'll belabor the question by simply saying recall that we increased both our dividend and our stock prices \u2013 our stock repurchases by 20% this year, to get us to the $0.90 quarterly rate on dividends and the $1.5 billion of stock buybacks. Obviously, we revisit this all the time. As we thought about that, that level of stock buybacks and dividends is sort of calibrated to our free cash flow ratio. We've brought that free cash flow ratio up to around 65% from where it was at 60% before. If you look at the dividends and the buybacks, it represents just under 60% of our earnings in the first quarter. So, you can sort of see we've got some flexibility against where we are, but we like to keep some room in that in order to be opportunistic to deploy some of our free cash flow towards growing the businesses, either organically or inorganically. Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And then can I sneak one last one in? On the International segment, can you give an update on how much of a headwind you'd expect low rates to be there? I mean it didn't appear to be having much of an impact this quarter. Will we start to see that later in the year? John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: No, I don't think so. Recall in Japan that we hedged the currency. And in terms of interest rates, we don't think it's going to be a headwind. The interest rates have been low, they remain low. We've been operating in a low environment for a long period of time. And so, I think we're comfortable with where we are. Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Brad, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. That will come from John Barnidge with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead, sir. John Bakewell Barnidge - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Thank you. Given where evaluations have fallen this year in life insurance, as well as asset managers, can you talk about your interest in acquiring blocks, whole businesses, or even a traditional asset manager? Thank you for your answer. Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: John, this is Steve. I'll address your question as it relates to \u2013 as it relates to asset management. We certainly have been very successful in growing our business organically. The business that you see today is virtually entirely the product of organic growth. However, as we've mentioned before, we are open to opportunities for inorganic growth. However, in looking at those opportunities, we're very mindful of the importance of avoiding undue social disruption in the asset management business. And so, I think what you'll see or what we have a greater interest in is opportunities that might fit neatly into our multi-manager model, not necessarily opportunities that call for broad-based integration efforts across multiple asset classes, but rather things that can slot neatly into the overall architecture of our multi-manager model. Matters like this will probably naturally tend to be relatively smaller in size rather than deals of very, very large size, but nonetheless, we feel we can attractively utilize the capabilities that such efforts might bring us. On the Life basis, we are always looking for ways to continue to bolster the mortality side of the mortality longevity equation that John mentioned in his opening comments. Certainly, our pretty strong sales levels are one way of doing that, but we also look at opportunities on the inorganic front, as well. John Bakewell Barnidge - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Great, thank you for your time. Operator : And, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thanks for your participation and for using AT&T executive teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

Analysts: John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. Erik James Bass - Autonomous Research US LP Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience in standing by and welcome to the Prudential Second Quarter of 2018 Earnings Call. At this time, all of your participant phone lines are in a listen-only mode and later there will be an opportunity here for your questions. Just a brief reminder, today's conference is being recorded, and I would now like to turn the conference over to Head of Investor Relations, Darin Arita. Darin Arita - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thank you, Justin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Representing Prudential on today's call are John Strangfeld, Chairman and CEO; Mark Grier, Vice Chairman; Charlie Lowrey, Head of International Businesses; Steve Pelletier, Head of Domestic Businesses; Rob Falzon, Chief Financial Officer; and, Rob Axel, Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by John, Mark and Rob, and then we will take your questions. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of such measures to the comparable GAAP measures and a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, please see the section titled Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures of the materials for today's presentation. These can be found on our website at investor.prudential.com. You will notice that we made changes to the format of our slide presentation. We hope this provides you with more color on the strategic direction of our company and the key priorities of our businesses. Also, as a reminder, we will be hosting an Investor Day in Tokyo on the morning of September 27. The focus will be on our international businesses with an emphasis on Japan. We hope that you will be able to join us. And with that, let's turn to slide 2 and I will hand it over to John. John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thank you, Darin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased with the momentum of our business in the first half of the year. We continue to bring financial opportunity to more and more customers around the world in new, exciting and compelling ways. I will expand on our U.S. financial wellness initiative in a few moments. We generated an attractive operating return on equity and double-digit growth in both adjusted earnings per share and adjusted book value per share. And with our strong capital position, we returned approximately $760 million to shareholders; as well, significantly strengthened our Long-Term Care reserves. We expect to continue a robust level of capital return and to utilize the remaining $750 million of our share repurchase authorization by the end of the year. Turning to slide 3, I will provide some additional financial highlights on the second quarter. We produced an annualized operating return on equity of 13.5%, which was above our near to intermediate-term objective of 12% to 13%. Our second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $3.01 grew significantly from the prior year. This increase was driven by growth in the business, tax reform, and assumption updates. Adjusting for notable items, earnings per share grew 16%. Our current quarter net income was also affected primarily by the significant strengthening of our Long-Term Care reserves, as I noted earlier. Rob Falzon will discuss this in more detail. Our adjusted book value per share of $92.60 is up 14% over the prior year. This increase reflects the earnings we generated as well as the impact of tax reform and accounting changes at the start of 2018. Partially offsetting these items were the payment of $3.30 per share of common stock dividends and about $1.4 billion of share repurchases over the past year. With respect to our business segments, here are some highlights from the quarter. PGIM, which is our investment management business, continued to produce positive net flows with $7.3 billion in the quarter. Our Retirement business had record account values of $433 billion, including net flows of $2.8 billion driven by pension risk transfer and full service sales. The third quarter has started well, with our recently announced pension risk transfer transaction with Raytheon totaling close to $1 billion. Our Individual Annuities business produced sales of $2.1 billion, which were 37% higher than the prior year and up 20% sequentially. And in International, we continued to produce steady in-force growth. Now, turning to slide 4, I'm extremely excited about our potential to accelerate earnings growth as we continue to unlock value through our unique business model. Not only does our model allow us to manage risk and deploy capital in a way that is attractive to shareholders, our model and business mix also allows us to design and deliver integrated solutions at scale to bring financial security more into reach for a growing base of customers. By combining our competencies across disciplines, we generate outcomes that other companies simply cannot replicate. There are three key points I'd like to make regarding our financial wellness initiative in the United States. First, we have built up significant experience since launching this initiative three years ago and have continued to innovate. Second, we believe our integrated holistic solutions, which are available in person or online, provide meaningful differentiation in the market. And third, our value proposition is resonating with employers and individuals and this is resulting in commercial success. We view financial wellness as a way to help people drive behaviors that allow them to effectively manage their day-to-day finances, achieve their most important financial goals and protect themselves against key risks. As a reminder, we launched financial wellness with the introduction of Prudential Pathways and, in this program, our Prudential advisors provide education for employees of our workplace clients. Should these employees want more information and solutions for their needs, they can follow up with our advisors. Customers can also receive education and solutions in digital form, since the launch of our digital financial wellness platform. Employers also find significant value in this digital platform as they can better understand the financial wellness of their overall employee population. We have critical ingredients to deliver integrated solutions that address the holistic financial needs of individuals, and these include our own financial advisors, workplace access to over 20 million people via our Retirement and Group insurance businesses, income and protection solutions via our Individual Annuities and Individual Life businesses, and Investment Management solutions via (7:30) PGIM. All of this is built on our own technology platform. This integration creates value in several ways. First, institutional customers only need to work with one party. Second, we can enhance customer experiences and solutions, and these experiences are personalized with solutions tailored to each person's needs. We have the flexibility to adapt and refine the experiences and solutions by having all of the capabilities I previously mentioned. And this is further enabled by our digital and data analytics expertise. And third, having all the parts of the value chain will allow us to deliver sustainable value to our shareholders. Our solutions that I'm describing are resonating. Since launching financial wellness, over 350 employers representing more than 4 million employees have signed up for Prudential Pathways. When people attend the education seminars, many schedule follow-up meetings with our financial advisors. And the types of employers that have signed up represent a broad spectrum and include several well-known brands from amongst the largest and fastest growing companies in the country. Also, approximately 200 employers are using our digital financial wellness platform. We're very excited about how our business has come together to make a meaningful difference in the financial health for people. And innovations like Prudential Pathways and our digital financial wellness platform don't happen without an inclusive, empowering culture that promotes internal partnerships. We've witnessed the power of bringing together different perspectives, experiences, and technical expertise to gain deeper insights, develop new offerings, and enter new markets. Our own pension risk transfer business was born from this type of a entrepreneurial culture and partnering capability, and financial wellness is another great example. I continue to believe that Prudential's culture is a competitive advantage and I'm excited to see how our talented people continue to push the company into new areas for growth, areas that are consistent with our mission and our purpose. With that, I'll turn it over to Mark, who will provide an update on how our businesses are executing on key priorities. Mark? Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening. Thank you, John. I'll be going through comments on each of our businesses in a few minutes, but let me start off by reminding you that we've often talked about ourselves as a very good story around developing thoughtful strategies, executing well, building good business fundamentals, and realizing attractive financial results. And, in fact, we often start our earnings calls by talking about the attractive business fundamentals reflected in sales and flows, for example, that we're experiencing in our businesses So, under that umbrella of the themes, strategy, execution, fundamentals, and results, I'm going to make a few comments on each of our businesses. I won't be going through that whole equation for everything we do everywhere, but there are things that are worth highlighting in the context of each of our businesses. Before I get into a business-by-business discussion, though, let me mention a few common themes that run across our businesses, and these are themes that are not necessarily so visible. These are things that are in the heart of our execution processes that are making differences to us in our markets and with our clients. The first common theme, and it's part of a lot of what John talked about, is the notion of enhancing our value propositions. And the practical consequence of that is that we are able to compete on a basis other than just price because of the attraction of the value proposition that we've put in front of our clients. Importantly, this is not a theoretical aspiration for us. We're seeing real results in the marketplace, reflecting differentiation and reflecting the attraction of a value proposition that goes beyond price competition. The second common theme that runs across our businesses relates to what we're doing to impact the front end, our customer-facing activities. And almost everywhere, we're doing things that are changing our client experiences, folding into the notion of enhanced value propositions and, again, having concrete results with respect to either individual or institutional businesses. And then finally, technology runs across so many of the things that we're doing that it's worth highlighting the idea of digital, mobile, and data in a number of aspects of our businesses. John mentioned how important technology is to the financial wellness proposition, but technology runs through a lot of the things that we're doing in the context of that front-end impact and also in the context of the enhanced value proposition. So, big deal there. And each of these impacting what we do in the markets every day are things that are driving the attractive business fundamentals that you're seeing. I want to now comment on the individual businesses. I'm going to start with slide 5. This one is titled PGIM. And again, I'm not going to go through the whole equation for everything everywhere, but I want to make some points that tie things together around our themes. But with respect to PGIM, our headline for a while has been net flows. Every year, we've counted one more year of consecutive positive flows, up now to 15 years of consecutive positive net flows in our Institutional business, 13 consecutive years of positive net flows in our Retail businesses. But the story isn't just arithmetic. These net flows tie specifically to the key priorities that are mentioned on the right-hand side of this slide. I guess, if there's a leading indicator of future flows, it's the first bullet under key priorities, which is investment performance. And you see metrics there that provide extremely attractive messages and signals about the prospects for future flows in this business. As our performance ages, we'll see three-year records becoming five-year records and five-year records becoming 10-year records, and you see very attractive performance relative to benchmark. And that has been one of the anchors over time, driving our flows in the Institutional and Retail Investment businesses. Then, you see some strategy bullets, and we've talked about these : leveraging scale; realizing the benefits of operating leverage, especially as we've highlighted in public fixed income; but also, expanding our global footprint. We are getting mandates from around the world. We are receiving recognition as an asset manager in publications in Europe, for example, and in publications in Asia, for example. So, the global footprint story really is working. I think the PGIM brand has been very helpful to us in that regard; and then, diversification with respect to products and capabilities. And so, we've talked about strategy initiatives and I've highlighted PGIM over and over as a great story over the past five or six years that relates strategy execution and results. And so, those flows do tie back to exactly the things that are listed under priorities to grow. I'd comment finally that, in the lower right-hand side of this, our overall fee rate is holding up very well in PGIM. And we've talked about the mix changes that are helping to offset some of the dynamics of product changes within Asset Management, and those mix changes continue to serve us well. Turning to the next slide, that's on Retirement. The big story here, I think, is probably across-the-board flows. You see on the bottom Institutional Investment product flows and Full Service net flows in Institutional Investment products. We did about $1 billion of PRT deals in the second quarter. John mentioned a big deal that's been done since then. And we did about $2.4 billion in two jumbo longevity swaps during the quarter. So, we continue to see robust business flows on the Institutional side. On the Full Service side, in the first half of the year, we had $16 billion in sales and deposits, and that resulted in a $3 billion net positive Full Service flow for the first half of the year. On the point I made earlier about differentiated value proposition, I would highlight the first bullet under key priorities to grow, which is the potential impact on our Retirement businesses, especially Full Service, of things that we're doing in financial wellness and how important that can be as part of our value proposition to clients. And as I said, it's not just a theoretical aspiration; it's happening. We see business coming in because of what we can do in the wellness arena. Turning to the next slide, Group Insurance, I guess the highlight here is to tie, again, back to the idea that our value proposition is resonating. We're closing, as John's slide mentioned, marquee business, not just on the basis of price, but on the basis of the wellness proposition and other dimensions of service. Under key priorities here, we mention financial wellness, again, but the third bullet also mentions improve organizational and process efficiencies. And we're doing things there that are impacting our customer experience and impacting our value propositions. And these things are paying off. So, the way in which we're approaching customers goes beyond the inclusion of the wellness initiative in our overall package to some specific aspects of how we deal with and how we treat clients; how we service customers, both at the individual level as beneficiaries, for example, but also at the Institutional level as Group Insurance clients. Turning to the next slide, Individual Annuities, I want to highlight three things. On the bottom left, you see that sales are growing. And what I'd say \u2013 what I would say about sales is that they're growing, they're well diversified, and we're selling at prices that are achieving or exceeding our target returns. So, it's a good solid attractive sales picture, reflecting efforts we've made in the product arena, but also reflecting our pricing discipline with respect to meeting profit targets. Second thing I want to highlight is on the bottom right, and that is the flow of dividends from our Annuity business to PFI. We have promised you, as we restructured and talked about the potential in this business, that we would generate healthy cash flows from our Variable Annuity business to the parent and we are realizing that, as you see in that slide. And then, finally, the third bullet under key priorities to grow reflects part of what Variable Annuities can do to be part of the integrated solutions that John mentioned that we're delivering across businesses, particularly with respect to secure retirement income in the workplace as it relates to Individual Annuities. We've launched a product called Guaranteed Income for Tomorrow. The short phrase for that is GIFT, and this is a specific extension of secure retirement income products into the workplace market in a way that we feel is very attractive and is an important complement to what we're doing overall in financial wellness. Let me turn, now, to Individual Life in the next slide. And I want to talk about two things here. One is the broad sales picture, which we would describe as very solid, but then this is an area where we're doing things that are impacting value proposition and impact on our client interfaces that are extremely important. We've added a capability that we call PruFast Track, which is an end-to-end solution that can bind policies in as quickly as 48 hours. This compares to a traditional issue process that may take several weeks. This process eliminates the need for health examinations. And this capability is unique in the marketplace coming from Prudential in several dimensions. One is we're selling our own products and our binding. We offer a broad array of products, including Term, Variable Universal Life, Fixed Universal Life, and Indexed Universal Life. We sell face amounts up to $1 million for age ranges between 18 and 60. We anticipate fully rolling this out in our third-party channels by the end of August, and we're optimistic that processes like this, which make life easier for people to do business with an insurance company, can have a significant positive impact on sales. The analogy generally is the whole digital world, where things are just easier, and we're making things easier in our Individual Life business. Let me turn, now, to International, and there are two slides. And I want to highlight common themes, and then a couple of specifics on each. There are three drivers of our International story at this point, and they're probably familiar. One is the importance of dollar products overall, but particularly in Japan. Our ability to sell dollar products, because of the quality of our sales forces, has allowed us to maintain strong sales results and strong profitability even in an environment in which some of the local currency products, again, especially referring to yen, have been challenged in terms of both attractiveness in the marketplace as well as profitability. So, headline number 1 is the importance of dollar products, and you see graphs of sales mix by currency on both of the pieces of the International picture. Second key bullet, the management of our Life Planner and Life Consultant forces. This includes growth. It includes quality. And I just reference quality in talking about dollar sales. And it also includes productivity, all of which are strong and improving for us and terrific assets in terms of the way we do business. And then, finally, a new one for us to talk about in International, which is digital, mobile and data analytics initiatives. And I would describe this as something below the level of total International, thoughtful market-by-market, tailored to the circumstances in our individual markets, but a package of initiatives that we'll be talking more and more about as we mature, both in terms of our front-end initiatives and in our back office and other capabilities. So just quickly on Life Planners, we've been through a couple of experiences, which we've talked about, where we've had a blip in sales manager growth followed by better results in terms of Life Planner growth. And we're kind of nearing one those blips right now. We have appointed a lot of sales managers and we're anticipating that there will be some reflection of that sales manager growth in Life Planner hiring over the next couple of years. It doesn't happen the next day, but there's a strong basic dynamic around the second bullet under priorities, which is Grow Life Planners. And that important dynamic relates to appointing sales managers. And then, I mention sales mix by currency just to highlight that on the bottom of that slide on the right. And then, turning to Gibraltar Life, two comments here. One is the currency results and, again, how important U.S. dollar products are and tying that back to the quality of our sales force and what they can do in the market that many others can't do. But I also want to highlight the multi-channel approach that's reflected in Gibraltar's results. Looking at the sales mix on the left, where you see Distribution, we have Life Consultants. We also have Independent Agents; and, we also have the Bank channel. And so, we continue to optimize across those channels with respect to both product design and, ultimately, volume and price. So good attractive results there. So that's it. As I said, I've highlighted some pieces under the strategy execution fundamentals and results equation. Good stories everywhere for us and some things that may not have been so visible that we're happy to be able to talk about. And with that, I'll hand it over to Rob. Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. I'm going to pick it up beginning on slide 12 by highlighting the notable items which have impacted the current quarter adjusted operating results. We have combined what we previously called market driven and discrete items with trend considerations into a single list of notable items. These items consist of the impact on results from our annual reviews, including assumption updates and other refinements, the quarterly updated estimate of Individual Annuities profitability driven by market performance, and the impact attributable to variances from our expectations for selected variable revenues and expenses. We highlight these items because their contribution to current quarter results may not be indicative of future performance. This year's Actuarial review included economic and insurance assumption updates and other refinements and resulted in a net unfavorable pre-tax adjusted operating income impact of $160 million on our ongoing businesses. We expect no meaningful change to our run rate earnings across our businesses from these updates and refinements. Current quarter returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees were about $10 million below our long-term expectations. In addition, the current quarter underwriting experience was approximately $85 million better than our average expectations, including favorable pension risk transfer case experience in Retirement. And finally, our Group Insurance business incurred elevated expenses in the current quarter, including the costs to terminate a third-party underwriting service provider contract. These services will be performed internally, which should reduce future underwriting costs. In total, these notable items reduced earnings by $102 million, or $0.19 per share. Excluding these notable items, earnings per share would be $3.20, up 16% from the year-ago quarter. Turning now to slide 13, I'll spend a few minutes discussing our Long-Term Care business. We entered the Long-Term Care business in the 1990s and actually issued our first individual Long-Term Care product in 1999. In 2012, we discontinued all sales of Long-Term Care products, classified this business as a divested business, and strengthened reserves by $700 million. We currently have approximately 211,000 policies in-force, with about 2% of these policies currently generating claims. We have been actively managing our Long-Term Care block by enhancing our claims management programs, optimizing our cost structure and successfully pursuing rate increases. Our experience of applying for and receiving approvals for rate increases is consistent with the assumptions in our reserves. Included in our reserves is $1 billion of combined future rate increases and benefit reductions in lieu of rate increases which have not yet been approved. During the quarter, we strengthened our GAAP reserves by $1.5 million as a result of updating our Actuarial assumptions. We removed our morbidity improvement assumption of 1% reduction in claims cost per year over a 20-year period, which increased our best estimate reserve by $1.4 billion. In addition, there were a number of other changes to our assumptions, the net effect of which was largely offset by the margin in our reserves that existed prior to the update. These changes align our assumptions with experience and industry data. Although, we removed our morbidity improvement assumption, we retained our mortality improvement assumption. If we also removed this latter assumption, our best estimate reserve would have been reduced by about $850 million. While strengthening our reserves, we continue to maintain a strong capital position and do not anticipate any change to our capital deployment plans, including the level of dividends and stock repurchases. For additional detail, we have included the key assumptions and sensitivities to changes in these assumptions in the appendix of this slide deck. We've also included in the appendix, additional details about the block. Here are a few of the highlights from that data. Our average attained age is 65 years old, which is relatively young and, therefore, likely to provide more time to collect premiums. About two-thirds of our book is group issued, which tends to have lower benefits than individual policies. And, as a result, less than 10% of our total policies have lifetime benefits, and less than 30% contain compound inflation features. Now turning to slide 14, I will provide an update on key balance sheet items and financial measures. Our cash and highly liquid assets at the parent company amounted to $4.7 billion at the end of the quarter. The sequential quarter decline of about $400 million was driven primarily by our redemption of high coupon junior subordinated note, partially offset by cash inflows which were in excess of shareholder distributions during the quarter. Shareholder distributions included dividends of $382 million and share repurchases of $375 million. The share repurchase authorization for the remainder of the year was $750 million as of June 30. Our domestic and international regulatory capital ratios are above our AA financial strength targeted levels and our financial leverage and total leverage ratios remain within our targets as of the end of the second quarter. In addition, we do not expect material impacts to capital from the proposed Variable Annuity statutory framework changes adopted by the NAIC Variable Annuities Issues Working Group last week. So, in summary, we are executing on our strategies and generating strong returns in growth in our adjusted earnings per share and adjusted book value per share while maintaining a robust capital position. Now, I'll turn it to the operator for questions. Operator : Thank you. First we'll go to the line of John Nadel of UBS. Your line is open. John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, good morning. So, this has been a long day and there's a lot going on. I guess the first question I have is, when I think about the morbidity improvement and the removal of that assumption from your Long-Term Care reserves, was that something that was an internally-motivated decision? Or was there any external influence on that decision, whether from regulatory bodies or rating agencies or any other constituents? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: John, it's Rob. That decision was entirely an internally-motivated decision. It was done with the benefit of consulting with industry experts and others in the industry from which we were able to glean insights as to trends that were occurring within the industry, but was not done in reaction to any regulatory stimulus. Sort of, if I expand on that a little bit, perhaps, and perhaps a little redundant with what I might have said in my opening remarks, but we discontinued the business back in 2012 and we took a $700 million strengthening of our reserves at that point in time. As I mentioned, we incorporated our reserve estimates for the morbidity improvement, which means people living healthier, which reduced our required reserves, as well as mortality improvement, which meant that people living longer, which conversely increases our reserves. John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC : Yes. Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Given the lack of the statistically significant experience in our book at that point in time, we relied on guidance from consultants, academic research, and industry practice. Since then, neither our experience, which has now, has sort of more statistical significance associated with it, or any of that consultation or survey with industry has indicated that there's been any morbidity improvement trend. So, at the same time, we're seeing the mortality improvements in this business and in other businesses. John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC : Yes. Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: So, based on that, we elected to \u2013 based on looking at that data and that industry experience, we elected to remove the morbidity improvement assumption, and that gave rise to that $1.4 billion charge while maintaining the mortality improvement assumption. And as I indicated in my remarks, that's about an $850 million addition to reserves \u2013 or attribution to reserves as a part of our assumption update process. Recognizing that that's a more conservative approach that others in the industry have taken, but it's consistent with our updated view of best estimate. John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC : Got you. And that's really helpful. I really appreciate that. And then, just second, or following up on that, does that change apply to both the Individual and the Group Long-Term Care block? Did you have that assumption in both places? And if so, can you give us an estimate on how to allocate that piece of it? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: So, yes, the assumption was \u2013 pertain to both blocks of business, Group and Individual, in the old assumption and in the update. So, it's been removed by both. The impact on either of those blocks in any given assumption, actually, is going to be variable, so there's not a consistent rule of thumb that you can use. With regard to this particular assumption, John, roughly what I would say is about 60% of it would have been driven from the Individual block and about 40% of it from the Group block. John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then, just one quick follow-up on an actual business question. Within Investment Management, or PGIM, results really stepped up in terms of the pre-tax operating income contribution. Looks like that was \u2013 I mean, revenues were sort of in line. You continue to grow very nicely. It looked like the biggest part of it \u2013 the biggest driver of the jump was the reduction in expense or spending. Is that sustainable? And if so, sort of what's driving that? Is it just sort of the runoff of some of the investment spending you've been making? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: John, this is Steve. I'll address your question. There's going to be some variability in relation to timing of expenses. For example, on a sequential quarter, our first quarter expenses would ordinarily be elevated by how we account for our long-term incentive compensation in the Asset Management business. And you're not seeing that show up in the same way in the second quarter. Also, as you note, looking at a longer-term time trend, some of the investments that we've been making in the business are reaching maturity and are yielding very, very significant benefits. But I would say that the main drivers, looking at a year timeframe or a multi-year timeframe in the Asset Management business and the growth in earnings there, have been continuing to attract very strong and robust flows, attracting those flows into areas where we already have existing strategies; so, therefore, we're able to onboard the flows in a very effective way and expand our margins and our ability that we've spoken about before, which we think is pretty distinctive in the industry, to maintain a stable average fee structure across the entire book of business at about 22 basis points. So, all of those factors, together, we see as really being the underpinning of positive earnings flow \u2013 positive earnings trends in PGIM. John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : Next, we have the line of Tom Gallagher of Evercore. Your line is open. Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI : Good morning. Hey, Rob, first just to follow-up to John's question, the \u2013 removing the morbidity improvement assumption with only 2% of your book now on claim, I mean, do you really have enough experience in terms of your own data to make that \u2013 to see that you're not seeing the emergence of morbidity improvement, or did you have to rely pretty heavily for that assumption change on the third-party consulting advice as well? Or was it a mix? Or \u2013 any help on that would be appreciated. Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yeah, so Tom, I would say it was a balance between the two. I would say when we initially took this, we had very little experience. We've now got five, six years' worth of experience that statistically you would call significant. As we look at that data, there's noise. And it clearly \u2013 as you would think given it still is a relatively shorter measurement period and, as we indicated, the number of claims that we have is relatively small to the overall book and to the population of claimants that are across the industry. So, we complemented that with looking externally and talking with consultants that we know have insights into what's happening across the industry to confirm that what we're seeing isn't any different than what others are experiencing across the industry. And based on what we got from those conversations and looking at our own book, felt that there was no discernible trend toward morbidity change. And so, our best estimate, therefore, recognizing that it could go either way, so something that you're trying to get as a mid-point is that there is no morbidity improvement occurring in our book or across the industry that would cause us to think that our book would ultimately behave in a different way than it has been. And let me \u2013 if you don't mind, let me just sort of add on just some sort of further thoughts on that. I think that this was, as we noted, it was somewhat unusual vis-a-vis peers in the industry. We recognize that. But \u2013 and while the charge associated with it, at $1.4 billion, is in excess, I think, of what Street expectations might have been as we were beginning to look at this \u2013 but, I would emphasize that we have a very strong capital position and it is largely unaffected by our across-the-board second quarter assumption updates. We continue to have the flexibility to finance our growth, including investments in our new business initiatives, while redeploying capital, including as I mentioned in my opening remarks, to our shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases, completely consistent with our existing plans. And all of that, incidentally, includes absorbing fully the impact of the Tax Act while maintaining our targeted AA solvency ratios, currently still at a 400% FICO ratio and remaining within our targets for liquidity and leverage as well. Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI : Thanks for that. And then, just a question about the trends you're seeing in the Long-Term Care block. I know, in 2017, there was sort of this spike in incurred claims up around 50%. Has that trend continued into 2018? Was that also part of the upsizing of the charge here or has that calmed down in terms of the actual trend? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: So, let me try taking a stab at that this way, Tom. When we did our assumptions, our assumptions now reflect our full historical experience through 2017. And based on that, our actual to expected is running at 100% over that period of time. And as we look at our 2018 experience as it's emerging, it is entirely consistent with those revised set of assumptions. And so, you sort of think about that as an average over that period of time, and 2018 being reflective of what that average is, recognizing that in any given period, be it quarter or year, you can get noise as we've expressed we saw during 2017. Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI : Thanks. And then, just one other quick one. Did you \u2013 the statutory charge you took, the $600 million... Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yeah. Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI : Did that \u2013 was that just on claim reserves or did you adjust active life reserves at all? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: There was a \u2013 well, the \u2013 no, that was the ALR. That was the active life reserve adjustment, Tom. So, the $600 million, there was small adjustments in GAAP and stat for the Disabled Life, the claims. The driver in both statutory and in GAAP was on our active life reserve. The $600 million was significantly less than the GAAP reserve because we had more margins in our reserves on a statutory basis relative to GAAP. But the same set of assumptions are used in the adjustments that we made in GAAP and stat, with the only difference being that stat \u2013 that you can see in the total reserves, they're slightly larger as a result of the pads that you have in stat relative to our GAAP results. Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Next, we have the line of Suneet Kamath of Citi. Your line is open. Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Just wanted to go back to the morbidity improvement, that you've removed the 1% assumption. But could that go the other way? In other words, if claims costs go up by 1% over 20 years, would that essentially, based on your sensitivities, require another $1.4 billion of reserves? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: So, let me try, Suneet, to answer that question this way. We removed the morbidity improvement assumption, as you indicated. We did provide to you sensitivities with regard to claims costs. And so, if you think about the potential variability in our claims costs, we said a reasonable sort of stressed kind of sensitivity around that, we put in there at plus or minus 5%. So, if our assumptions are that morbidity improvement \u2013 not only is there not morbidity improvement, but that we experienced some level of morbidity deterioration, if there was a 5% deterioration \u2013 not a 5% per year for forever, but a 5% holistic deterioration in that, that would be about a $500 million adjustment to our reserves, recognizing over the fullness of time with health innovation, et cetera, there might be an upward bias to that; but, if it were to be downward, that would be the order of magnitude to that. And we've provided similar assumptions to the \u2013 across the rest of what we believe to be the primary drivers to the reserves that we hold for this business. And I think I would characterize what we've done and the sensitivities being provided there, Suneet in the following way. One, it is comprehensive. And so, we've looked holistically at all the assumptions underlying our business and tried to reflect in those assumptions the experience that we've been seeing and what we can glean from what's happening across the industry. The \u2013 our desire was to put this issue to bed in the eyes of investors and to allow investors to focus on the strong fundamental and growth that we have in our operating businesses. Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Got it. And then, just on the same Slide 21, if we look at the $1 billion of future rate increases assumed in your reserves, so is that the same number for GAAP and stat? And separately, what was the prior assumption? In other words, what did you have built in before you did your second quarter of 2018 reserve review in terms of benefit from future reaction? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: So, first part of your question, yes, the same assumption being used in both GAAP and statutory reserves, as I'd indicated before. Second question, let me try approaching that a little differently, Suneet, to see if I can actually get at what I think you want to understand with respect to that $1 billion. Think about that as being in three tranches. The first is \u2013 about 10% of that we've already filed before. First, actually, let me also start with \u2013 put that in the context of we've actually already received about $0.9 billion worth of rate increases on this block over time from the point at which we impaired it back in 2012. So, hopefully that adds some perspective in terms of balancing this $1 billion against almost $1 billion that we've already achieved to date. And the assumptions driving this \u2013 the $1 billion that we have in there, are consistent with our experience in the first rounds of price increases that we sought and, incidentally, are subject to very robust underwriting in order to quantify that number to begin with. And so, going back to sort of thinking about those in buckets, 10% that's already been filed. About 30% of that actually represents instances where we've already had filings with the states where we've implemented a price increase, but where the \u2013 where we have agreed to come back to the state and do it in multiple steps as opposed to do it in a single rate increase. So, we implemented a rate increase, but we've agreed to come back and seek approval for a further rate increase in order to make it a more palatable outcome for consumers at the end of the day. And then, the remaining 60% would be new filings. And within those new filings, I would \u2013 that would represent both some of our legacy adverse experience that we've had as well as the new adverse experience that we updated as a result of this update. And think about that as being roughly evenly split between where we expect to get price increases and where we expect to actually \u2013 to come out in the form of benefit reductions in lieu of price increases. Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. And then, just lastly on the same topic, the assumption to get rid of the morbidity improvement, I mean, it seems like that's what your third-party actuarial consultants are recommending as a best practice, right? And I'm assuming \u2013 just trying to think through where the ranges of these assumptions are across different companies. Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Well, to be very clear, Suneet, we did not engage any consultants in the evaluation and the process that we went through. We consulted with outside parties, but there's no consultant that recommended to us this as a best estimate. Obviously, our accountants, who have actuarial expertise, have weighed in on this and they have confirmed that they believe that our approach to this is a reasonable approach to take with regard to establishing a best estimate. Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Rob. Operator : Next, we have the line of Alex Scott of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. So, my question is around just the cash flows. And, Rob, I think you mentioned that you absorbed \u2013 you were able to absorb a good amount here and still had the ability to kind of maintain the capital deployment plans. So, could you talk about what is driving \u2013 what are the parts of the business that are driving better free cash flow? And as we kind of think out to next year and beyond, I mean, is there upside as maybe you have some of these things that have been a drag fall away and kind of have continued acceleration in cash in some of the businesses, like Variable Annuities and maybe others? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: So, Alex, yeah, a couple of thoughts on that. First, as I mentioned before, we start from a position of having a very robust capital structure that's able to absorb a lot of the changes that are going through in the industry. So, you have the 2Q assumption updates that we've been through. You have the impact of the tax law change. You'll also have certain regulatory changes occurring that are occurring at the NAIC that are, I think, net chewing away at the RBC ratios of companies. And despite all of that, where we are at the end of the day is, pro forma for all of it, including sort of the full-year anticipated impacts of the Tax Act, we're able to maintain above our currently targeted RBC ratio of 400%. So, we start out in a very strong position. We also have the benefit of continuing to generate strong cash flow and capital. And so, in the course of the second quarter, just by way of example, while the statutory charge for our Long-Term Care business was \u2013 the increase and the strengthening of reserves in our Long-Term Care business was about $600 million. In other parts of RBC calculation, we actually generated incremental capital that almost entirely offset that reserve strengthening. And we see that dynamic. And so, if you look at sort of the fullness of this year and even what we've experienced to-date this year, what you're going to find is we have diversified businesses each of which provide robust cash flow and diversified sources of cash flow. So, in the current year, while we're strengthening PICA's reserves in order to respond to the impact from the tax law changes, we are getting from our International business significant free cash flow. We are getting from our PGIM business a very high free cash-flow ratio relevant to the strong earnings that we're generating from that. And as we've highlighted in the deck through the bar charts that we provided, our Annuities business at the current levels of sales is throwing off a significantly high level of free cash flow. And so, we're able to continue to generate free cash flow through the portfolio of businesses that we have and absorb the variety of reserve-strengthening initiatives that we and the industry are facing during the course of this year. Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then, maybe just to follow-up on the 12% to 13% ROE. How should I think about that near to intermediate-term ROE just in light of maybe the move up in interest rates and sort of the environment? I mean, are we at a point where maybe you could sort of revert back to the 13% to 14% that you guys have targeted historically? Or sort of where do we need to get in terms of rates to achieve that? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Well, I think about it this way. I think, first, as you've seen in our results and observe in the market, interest rates have been rising and that's been beneficial to us and to others in the industry. If you look at what I'll call our adjusted portfolio yields, so adjusting it for taking out the impact of alternatives and for where we've invested in Treasuries as we've waited to take the premiums and reinvest them into Corporates, in the first quarter, our portfolio yield was about 4.3%. If you look at our new money rates in the first quarter, it was about 4.25%. So, we're at the point in time, now, where we're investing is crossing over to our portfolio rate, whereas in the past you would have seen a very large gap between those two numbers. And so, I think the interest rate environment is rapidly ceasing to be a drag and will be pivoting over toward being actually a positive to earnings growth on a go-forward basis. Now, it took a compounding of several years for it to drag us down from 13% to 14% to our intermediate range of 12% to 13%, and we'll need to see some compounded period of being in that better interest rate environment before you'd expect, on a sustainable basis, our ROE to be in a 13% to 14% range. I would note that if you look at our ROE this quarter, on the sort of \u2013 adjusted for the notable items that we've called out, it's 13.5%. So, while we provided guidance of 12% to 13%, the reality is, in this current environment with the robust performance we're getting out of our businesses, we are actually exceeding that range that we've provided. Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Perfect. Thanks. Operator : And next, we have the line of Ryan Krueger of KBW. Your line is open. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. On the annuity ROA, it's been 121 basis points for the last two quarters. How much more near-term downside do you expect from the additional hedging actions, or are we mostly complete with that at this point? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Ryan, this is Steve. Maybe I'll jump in and Rob can add on. If you look at Annuities ROA on a year-over-year basis, there was a decline. I'd attribute that to three factors, consistent with what we've spoken about before : first, lower non-coupon earnings driving lower spread results; second, the aging of the book of business and fee compression that gradually results from that; and finally, amortization of hedging costs, as you mentioned. The first of those three factors varies from quarter to quarter. The second and the third, I would say \u2013 there are, obviously, real impacts, but they emerge very, very gradually over time, over an extended time period. So, if you're talking about near-term ROAs, I would say there's sustainability of our ROAs for the near term at our current level. Rob? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: The only thing I'd add to that \u2013 and, Ryan, this may be obvious by virtue of how you asked the question, but just to make sure that it's very clear is that our expected hedging costs are entirely in AOI today. And so, that's built into our AOI. We include the cost of hedging in that. Secondly, that when we have variances against that expected hedging, so what we call hedge breakage, that works its way into our benefit ratios and, therefore, also is amortized into our AOI. So, full cost of hedging is reflected in AOI over time. And that hedge experience has been generally on the positive side, but call it around neutral. And what you're seeing as a result of that is still a robust level of ROA, as Steve just walked through. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. And then, the Corporate segment, I know, is volatile, but it's been pretty favorable for a couple of quarters. Has anything changed there or should we expect it to revert back to a higher loss over time? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: So, our guidance for that, Ryan, has been that \u2013 think about it as being \u2013 and what we said in the past is an average of $350 million a quarter, subject to seasonality. So, obviously, we get the fourth quarter seasonality that we've walked through a number of times in the past. If you look at the actual average of the last four quarters, it's been slightly below that. So, it averages out around $340 million. And in the first and second quarters driving that because they've been below our run-rate expectations. Each of those quarters benefited by somewhere in the range of $15 million to $20 million of lower than expected compensation costs, both long-term and deferred, that are associated with market experience including, incidentally, our own stock price performance. The remainder of the variance came from lower net expenses across sort of a whole variety of activities. So, I think, while that experience \u2013 we can \u2013 it can be sustained, we don't believe that that experience would change our view going forward of what the run rate and seasonality would be. So, we've benefited from it, but not to the point where we would take a different view toward what we've stated in the past with regard to sort of the going forward run rate of the business (57:35). Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Got it. Thanks a lot. Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Okay. Operator : And our last question comes from the line of Erik Bass of Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Erik James Bass - Autonomous Research US LP : Hi, thank you. I guess, following up on Alex's question, if we look at the dividends paid from PALAC year-to-date, it's been about 70% to 75% of AOI. So is this a reasonable way to think about the sustainable cash generation of the Annuities business, and how sensitive is this to the level of sales volumes? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: So, I would say that the Annuities business is a positive contributor to our overall targeted free cash flow. So, think about our free cash flow, as we've articulated, as being around 65% of our earnings. And at current levels of sales we would expect the Annuities business actually to be reasonably materially in excess of that; and, we believe that that's a sustainable level. The volatility \u2013 we don't believe that it's particularly volatile on a go forward basis, either. The changes that would occur there would be, as Steve has expressed before, things that would be reflected over a fairly long period of time. We're very well capitalized within that business, and so changes in market conditions and/or other drivers to the reserves would not alter the level of distributions from free cash flow that we anticipate and are currently getting from the business. Erik James Bass - Autonomous Research US LP : Thank you. And then, yesterday, Fidelity got a fair amount of press coverage for eliminating fees on certain of its index products. Do you see this having implications for pricing in the Asset Management or Defined Contribution retirement businesses more broadly? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Erik, it's Steve. I'll address your question. For some time, we've been very acutely aware of the fact that the most rapid fee compression in the Asset Management business has really been taking place over multiple years within the passive space. And you saw the press coverage yesterday referring to yesterday's move as the race to zero and this being the logical conclusion of it. It's a race that we're not participating in. Several years ago, we made the strategic decision that we were going to \u2013 that we were not going to compete in the passive space. But even back then, it was a space well-spoken for by a handful of competitors. And instead, we would focus on the long-standing value proposition of our Investment Management business, which is alpha generation, alpha that our clients can use alongside the index exposure that they can draw from passive managers on a cost-effective basis; but, really focusing on our ability to generate alpha through active management. And the result of that decision, over multiple years, has been that passive assets represent less than 2% of total AUM and well under 1% of total fees. Our fees are based on our generation of alpha, based on the foundation of strong investment performance and strong distribution capabilities, generating attractive flows at stable fee levels, that 22 basis points I mentioned, which has been stable for us now over an extended period of time. And we expect it to remain so. Erik James Bass - Autonomous Research US LP : Thank you. Appreciate the comments. Operator : At this point, I'll be happy to turn it back to John Strangfeld for any closing remarks John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thank you very much. I'd just like to bring this back and close it with just a few final thoughts. Bottom line of this whole discussion is our businesses are performing very well. They're supported by a strong balance sheet. We're very confident in our ability to both innovate and execute. And we \u2013 our talented employees who embody our purpose-driven culture are ultimately at the core of who we are and what we do. And collectively, we deliver sustainable value for our customers, our community, and our stakeholders. And I'd like to thank you very much for your time and attention today. And have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen still connected, that does conclude the presentation for this morning. Again, we thank you very much for your participation and using our Executive TeleConference Service. You may now disconnect.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Mr. Darin Arita. Please go ahead. Darin Arita - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thank you, Tawny. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today's call are John Strangfeld, Chairman and CEO; Mark Grier, Vice Chairman; Charlie Lowrey, Head of International Businesses; Steve Pelletier, Head of Domestic Businesses; Rob Falzon, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by John, Mark and Rob, and then we will answer your questions. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures.

Also as a reminder, we will be hosting our 2019 Financial Outlook call on December 6th at 11 :00 a.m. Eastern. In the call, we plan to provide our 2019 EPS guidance range. We hope that you will be able to join us. And with that I will hand it over to John. John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thank you, Darin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased with the continued momentum our businesses. During the quarter, we rolled out and expanded initiatives to deliver financial opportunity to more and more people around the world. We produced sustainable returns and strong business growth and maintained a solid capital position while distributing $755 million to our shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. In addition, we announced leadership succession plans that reflected a thoughtful, multi-year process by our board and our organization's emphasis on talent and culture. I'm confident that our next generation of leadership led by Charlie and Rob alongside our seasoned management team will continue our momentum for many years to come. We also welcome the Financial Stability Oversight Council's decision earlier last month to rescind Prudential's designation as a systemically important financial institution. We believe this outcome reflects Prudential sustainable business model, capital strength, and comprehensive risk management framework, which have and continue to enable us to fulfill our promises to our customers to deliver consistent performance and to meet regulatory obligations. Turning to slide 3. I will provide some additional financial highlights on the third quarter. We produced an annualized operating return on equity of 13.5%, above our near-to-intermediate term objective of 12% to 13%. Adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter were $3.15, up 5% from $3.01 last year, driven by business growth, tax reform, and capital management. Net income was higher in the year-ago period, reflecting gains on derivatives. Our adjusted book value per share of $95.20 is up 12% over the prior year. This reflects the earnings we generated, as well as the impact of tax reform and accounting changes implemented at the start of 2018. These items were partially offset by the payment of $3.45 per share of common stock dividends totaling $1.1 billion and about $1.4 billion of share repurchases over the past year. Our performance for the third quarter was driven by momentum across our businesses, which worked together to serve the needs of our individual customers, distribution partners, and institutional clients. Here are a few highlights from the quarter. PGIM, which is our global investment management business continued to produce positive net flows, this time of $8.7 billion for the quarter. Our Retirement business had record account values of $447 billion, including net flows of 6 billion driven by our pension risk transfer and full service sales. Our Individual Annuities business produced sales of $2.2 billion, which were 69% higher than a year-ago quarter, and up 8% sequentially. And we also continued to generate steady growth across our International businesses. Now turning to slide 4, I'd like to provide an update on Prudential's financial wellness initiatives, which are helping us build deeper relationships that address the changing financial needs of our customers. We're using technology to deliver the full breadth and depth of our collective businesses, so that we can enter new market segments and address an increasingly diverse range of customer needs and financial challenges. One recent example is the launch of LINK by Prudential, an online experience that helps individuals visualize their financial goals. LINK connects individuals with solutions and financial professionals to help them with their unique goals from investment and retirement, to safeguarding the future of loved ones. One can access LINK via our Prudential.com website or through an employer where LINK is enabled through our digital financial wellness platform. I'm pleased to note, our digital financial wellness platform available to new and existing workplace clients is growing rapidly. The platform enables individuals to engage in a wide range of financial topics, access multimedia content personalized for their needs, and utilize tools to better manage their financial lives. In addition, employers can better understand the financial wellbeing of their overall workforce. Today, our digital wellness platform is used by approximately 1,300 organizations covering more than 1.7 million employees. Our goal is to deploy this by early next year to more than 2,500 organizations covering more than 4 million individuals. And our customers aren't the only ones taking notice. We were honored to be included in Fortune magazine's 2018 Change the World list, which highlights companies making a positive social impact through their core business strategies. And we continue to build upon our leadership position and commitment to financial wellness through the launch of programs like our State of US brand campaign. This campaign, informed by individual stories and intended to highlight the financial issues faced by everyday Americans, is currently airing across broadcast, social media and other channels. To summarize, we are very excited about what our businesses can collectively deliver to make a meaningful difference in people's financial lives, helping them achieve their fullest potential, as we unlock new opportunities to grow our business. With that, I'll turn it over to Mark, who will provide an update on how our businesses are executing on key priorities. Mark? Mark B. Grier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thanks, John. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening. Before I touch on strategic and tactical highlights in individual businesses, I want to step up to the higher level of strategy, execution, fundamentals and financial results. I've often commented that as a company overall and in a number of our individual businesses, we're a great story around the way these things have come together to drive successful business initiatives. And sometimes, they come together in individual businesses or business-by-business, focused on specific things. And we've highlighted there, for example, success in Japan, success in pension risk transfer, the strategy execution and fundamental story in PGIM, all of which play out very well for us. We're also now emphasizing strategies that leverage and exploit our whole franchise value. And this adds the dimension of cross-business collaborative and unique strategies and unique execution opportunities for us. So in that context, thinking about strategy, execution and fundamentals, we're pursuing compelling objectives. And I want to highlight four things that run through many of the aspects of the individual businesses that I'll touch on in a minute. First of all, we're enhancing how we help customers meet their needs. Remember Bring Your Challenges. The language of the company is solutions and outcomes. That's how we talk about our products now. We're focused on new distribution, making it easier for us to access clients and for clients to access us. Headlines there include the wellness platform and the digital initiatives. And we're growing in our existing distribution channels. Secondly, we're implementing process efficiencies that positively impact clients and their experiences with us. The results reflecting these two aspects of strategy and execution include good growth momentum, as evidenced by sales and flows over time across all of our businesses. But completing the story, profitable growth at attractive returns, reflecting financial and risk discipline and thoughtful pricing strategies. So as I go through the individual businesses, think about the way they tie back to meeting client needs, to improving processes and to building growth momentum, as we translate strategy into execution. I'll start now with PGIM, and this is beginning with slide 5 in the deck. The PGIM strategy is defined by meeting client needs as a strategic partner and across a broad range of asset classes and investment vehicles. And now engagement and dialogue with clients and partners have never been stronger. It's an interesting time though. Interest rates are higher, equity markets are more volatile, and there is a positive return on cash. And so we would anticipate that this environment will have an impact on client decisions. And the way in which they think about things may result in more variability in the flows that we see. But with the underpinning of very successful execution in the context of thoughtful strategy, we're maintaining very strong business momentum in PGIM. On slide 5, I want to highlight a couple of things. Under Key Priorities, strong investment performance, ultimately in a way, drives everything. And I want to highlight the five-year performance of AUM versus benchmark. And note that 90% of the assets under management have outperformed their benchmarks over five years. Shifting to the lower left picture, that investment performance fundamental translates in a nearly linear way into the very strong flows that we realize. And this is the fundamental that we talk about all the time. We had a very strong quarter for Institutional flows. We had record International flows. And we've commented before on 15 consecutive years of positive flows in Institutional businesses and 13 consecutive years of positive flows in Retail businesses. Just to touch on a couple of the other key priorities to grow earnings : With respect to expanding our global footprint, as I just mentioned, we had a record International flows in the quarter. We also have a record percent of our sales and investment professionals outside the U.S. in PGIM now. With respect to products, we now have two active fixed income ETFs; launching the second one just about as I speak, and we have established a new alternatives group that will focus on mezzanine finance and direct lending. So, the elements that execute in the context of strategy and strong fundamentals remain very much in place with respect to PGIM. Let me turn to Retirement now on the next page. And I really just want to highlight the two bottom charts. We are emphasizing flows in Full Service on the right-hand side. Year-to-date $26 billion of sales and deposits in Full Service across a good mix of clients, between large clients and core clients and that's translated into $6 billion of net flows year-to-date in Full Service. We're also doing very well in PRT on the Institutional Investment side. In the quarter, $5 billion were funded with reinsurance PRT transactions and we announced another $1.6 billion transaction shortly after the quarter ended and we have a very strong and good pipeline in pension risk transfer as we've mentioned often on these calls. As I bridge from Retirement to Group, let me highlight again the importance of the wellness opportunity, but specifically as it relates to these two businesses, wellness amplifies our opportunities; it strengthens our sponsor relationships and it provides a meaningful retail potential for us through our Institutional channels. And so as we move into a couple of comments on Group, the first comment, deepening employer and participant relationships with financial wellness programs remains the centerpiece of a lot of what's going on in Group and we've talked about proof points there demonstrating success. I do want to add, with respect to process efficiencies and making us easier to do business with, that in Group we did launch additional digital capabilities in Disability and these digital capabilities enhance and improve our claim submission and management results. Let me turn to Individual Annuities. Two quick highlights here. The first is another dividend; and you see in the bottom right-hand chart, $285 million in the quarter. We have been highlighting free cash flow and attractive returns; that continues to be visible as we pay dividends from our Annuity Business. And then I also want to comment on the increase in sales. John mentioned it. The editorial on this is that sales in Annuities are broader and deeper, reflecting growth in different products, diversification of products and also strength in our traditional channels. Before I leave Individual Annuities, just one additional comment, which is, remember, the wellness opportunity for secure retirement income. The Individual Annuity business, as are all of our businesses, has a role in our wellness initiative and the opportunity to put secure retirement income products on our wellness platform is something that we think is very important for us. Let me move to Individual Life on Page 9. And I want to highlight two things here. I spent some time in the last call discussing a streamlined underwriting process that facilitates binding policies in as fast as 48 hours, and during the quarter we rolled that streamlined underwriting process out to third parties; again, a substantial process improvement for us and something that we believe is a material benefit to our partners and our direct distributors in our Individual Life business. On the product side, during the quarter we re-launched and improved VUL Protector product in September, continuing our emphasis on matching the right products with the right opportunities and channels. And so we are optimistic about product enhancements as well as process enhancements in Individual Life. Let me turn to Life Planner and Gibraltar. But before I do, I want to briefly recap messages from our Tokyo Investor Day. We emphasized in our International businesses differentiated business models with superior execution. And you should think of that as distinctive sales capability that drives high return protection solutions in the market for us. We also talked about sustained growth with strong returns and steady capital generation. And you should be thinking there that part of that growth opportunity is meeting evolving client needs. And then finally, we talked about strategic investments that enhance our long-term prospects. And so those are the themes that run over both Life Planner and Gibraltar, and so I'm going to highlight a couple of more tactical aspects of where we are there. With respect to Life Planner, very good quarter for sales. Life Planner sales were up 11%. Sales in Prudential of Japan were up 17% and the Life Planner count in Japan and in Brazil has grown to an all-time record level. We had LP growth of about 5% in Japan. So, great dynamics there and I guess I'd emphasize the term we often use in International, which is that the vital signs look absolutely terrific. Turning to Gibraltar. I want to touch on the three distribution channels here because we have different things going on in each. With respect to the bank channel, our sales were down and this reflects the chronic discipline that we impose with respect to both pricing and product and the fact that we don't chase this market when it's moving in a direction in which we don't want to go. We will see declines in our product sales and so we've seen it recently in the bank channel. On the other hand, the Independent Agency Channel is up about 9% and we are strategically expanding in the Independent Agency Channel and so that's a gratifying result for us. And then with respect to Life Consultants, we have been imposing higher standards, and so the emphasis on quality and productivity does result in a decrease in our Life Consultant count. We are down about 4%, but again on the gratifying side, Life Consultant sales are just about flat. So, different stories reflecting the way in which we are approaching different channels in Gibraltar, but overall a very good, consistent strategic and execution story with respect to what's happening in Gibraltar. And I will stop there and hand it over to Rob. Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. I'll begin on slide 12 by highlighting the notable items which have impacted the current quarter adjusted operating results. As we introduced last quarter, in addition to the impact on results from the quarterly updated estimate of Individual Annuities profitability driven by market performance, notable items include the impact attributable to variances from our expectations for selected revenues and expenses. We highlight these latter items because while their contributions to the current quarter results are economic, they may not be indicative of future performance. The current quarter unfavorable impact of the market and experience unlockings in the Annuities business was $36 million. The current quarter returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees were about $35 million below our long-term expectations. And the current quarter underwriting experience was approximately $65 million better than our average expectations, primarily driven by more favorable mortality experience in Individual Life, reflecting lower than expected large case claims. As an aside, while less favorable than our average expectations, our Retirement business continued to demonstrate positive case experience in the quarter. In total, these notable items reduced pre-tax earnings by about $6 million or $0.01 per share. Excluding notable items, earnings per share would be $3.16, up 9% from the year-ago quarter. And speaking about our earnings pattern, I would also note that we have historically experienced higher than average expenses in the fourth quarter. This includes the impact of seasonal items such as annual policyholder communications, employee onboarding and severance, as well as business development, advertising and other variable costs. Looking back over the past three years, this pattern has produced expenses on average about $125 million to $175 million higher in the fourth quarter than the average quarterly level for the respective year. In addition, we have completed the hedging of our expected yen earnings in our International business for 2019, and our hedging rate for the next year will be 105 yen per U.S. dollar as compared to the $111 for 2018. Turning to slide 13. I'll provide an update on key balance sheet items and financial measures. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company amounted to $5.2 billion at the end of the quarter. The sequential quarter increase of about $500 million was driven by proceeds from our $1.6 billion of junior subordinated notes issue this quarter, partially offset by senior debt maturities of about $700 million and a capital contribution to PICA to address the impacts of the Tax Act as we discussed on previous calls. I would also note that we have established a targeted operating range of cash and liquid assets at the parent company of $3 billion to $5 billion with the low end of the range equal to approximately two times our annual fixed charges. Cash inflows from the businesses during the quarter supported the $755 million of shareholder distributions, which were roughly evenly split between dividends of $380 million and share repurchases of $375 million. And our share repurchases authorization for the remainder of the year is $375 million as of September 30th. Our domestic and international regulatory capital ratios are above our AA financial strength targeted levels. Further, we do not expect material impacts to target capital levels from the proposed Variable Annuities statutory framework that has been adopted by the NAIC Variable Annuities Issues Working Group. And finally, our financial leverage and total leverage ratios remain within our targets as of the end of the third quarter. In summary, during the quarter we generated a strong return on adjusted operating equity, double-digit growth in adjusted book value per share and solid sales and net flows across our businesses while maintaining a robust capital position. Our complementary mix of businesses with leading market positions and integrated solutions for customers are executing on our strategies and producing attractive returns for our stakeholders. Now we'll turn it over to the operator for questions Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. If I look at your year-to-date run rate EPS and adjust for tax reform, the growth has been on the high end of the 6% to 11% guidance range that you gave last year and your ROE has been above the 12% to 13%. Can you help us think about if there \u2013 have there been any major, I guess themes that would have impacted results this year that you wouldn't think would be sustainable going forward? 1Or is that a reasonable way to think about the kind of growth and ROE power of the company at this point? John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: So, Ryan, I think when we think about our ROE, the guidance that we gave was that in the intermediate term we would continue to expect that to be in the 12% to 13% range, given that we have gone through a fairly long period of sustained low interest rates. Obviously, interest rates have been moving up. And we've had very favorable equity markets. And the combination of those, plus very strong fundamental performance out of our businesses has resulted in our return on equity being \u2013 operating at a range that is at the very high end of that guidance that we provided. At this point in time, given where we are in the cycle, that's probably to be expected. And we talk about that 12% to 13% as being a return over a cycle. Over time, we're seeing that the headwinds associated with sustained low interest rates are abating. And we continue to see good fundamental performance in our businesses. So over a longer period of time we would expect that to allow us to sort of return to that more normal long term range of 13% to 14%. But at this point in time, we're not ready to modify that guidance. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay, thanks. And then on PRT, you had pretty good activity in the quarter. You've already announced one deal in the fourth quarter. Can you talk a little bit about how the pipeline and the outlook looks there? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Ryan, it's, Steve. I'll take that question. I think the pipeline looks very, very robust. Frankly, it looks as robust or even more so than we've seen in recent years. I think that's a combination of a couple of factors. First of all, the increase in interest rates and what that means in terms of higher funding levels for defined benefit pensions, means that more and more companies are in a position to transact. And propensity to transact continues to be powered by a growing awareness on the part of these companies of the longevity risk inherent in their plans. So the combination of those two things makes the pipeline look very, very strong. And we also feel very good about our ability to compete in the context of this pipeline. I say that in particular, because we have visibility on a strong pipeline in the large case market, call it $1 billion plus or minus and above, in which we are particularly well-suited to compete due to the capabilities that we built in the business around ability to bring transactions, to bring large transactions swiftly to an effective close. And the ability to onboard large numbers of participants and give them the type of customer experience that their plan sponsors expect and that the participants deserve. So again, strong pipeline, and we feel good about our position to compete in it. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Do you tend to see a desire by corporations to get things done before year end? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: There does tend to be a tendency that we've seen for the third and the fourth quarters to be particularly strong in pension risk transfer activity. That's been the case for the past few years now. Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. I had a couple \u2013 a few questions just on the International business. First, could you give some color on, your other country sales I think were flat. So which countries are you doing well in? And where might \u2013 have sales been weak? And then I have a couple more. Charlie F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Sure, Jimmy, it's Charlie. Sales in Brazil continue to go up. As Mark said, we have a record Life Planner count and so \u2013 and they have a high degree of productivity there. And so we see sales going up there. Sales in Korea and Taiwan were flat as we continue with our back to the basics strategy. And the number of Life Planners have been decreasing. Interestingly, and one really good thing that's happening in Korea, is that we have shifted a number of Life Planners, in fact a significant number of Life Planners, over to be sales managers. And as you've seen in Japan when we have done that in Prudential of Japan, our Life Planner business there, what happens is, you have about a year lag, but then you start increasing the number of Life Planners. And so I think our transition of Life Planners to sales managers in Korea bodes well for sales in the future. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then do you expect an impact on your Japanese business from sort of the expected increase in the consumption tax in 2019? Charlie F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Not as much. So much of the business we do isn't affected by the consumption tax. Some of it is in, say, the bank channel, but a lot of it is not. The consumption tax has to do with both where the business is done and also the size of the business. And so it may have a marginal impact. But when the consumption tax went up a number of years ago, we didn't see a significant effect from it. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then just lastly, I think you mentioned that Life Planner expenses were lower because of either timing of costs or other things. Can you quantify roughly how much that was? Charlie F. Lowrey - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Not really. What happened in the POJ was there were a number of, let's call it, dominoes that all fell in the right direction. And this was throughout actually the businesses in Japan. So it happened with Gibraltar too. And that was some of the businesses just had sort of ones and twos fall on our direction. And then we had some expense timing things, which will probably fall into the fourth quarter. So we're not going to give you a number. But there were both those factors that led to what we would say an elevated income level this quarter. Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Dally with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, thanks, good morning. So, on the annuity space, somewhat surprising to see the core earning sequentially decline, given the strength of equity markets that you saw last quarter. So, hoping you can provide some color on what drove that and what we should expect for the return on assets, how we should expect that to trend. Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Nigel, it's Steve. I'll take your questions. Thanks very much. This quarter's ROA of 118 basis points reflects a couple of things that we'd mentioned. First of all, why we didn't call them out in our release or anything like that, we did have some one-time costs associated with the systems migration. That reflected about two basis points. Second, we also had higher variable selling costs which were included in that ROA calculation and that comes with the higher sales that we saw in the business in the quarter. That again, reflected for about another two basis points. So, if you build those things into the equation, we still see an ROA in the Annuities business that is very consistent with the guidance that we have given before of 120 basis point range give or take. Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's helpful, thanks. Second question is just on losing the SIFI designation. I know you saw group supervisor in New Jersey but are there going to be some expense saves that you are likely to realize from losing that designation? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Nigel, it's Rob. So what we've expressed before and I think still holds is that as we \u2013 if you look last year, our enhanced supervision costs were about $120 million for the full year. As we think about the \u2013 no longer being a SIFI, our expectation is that about a third of those costs go away very rapidly and almost instantaneously, which is a combination of the fees that we are paying for Fed supervision and some consulting expenses that we would no longer need to incur. About a third of those costs are associated with projects that were in the process of completing and so they will sunset or go away in the course of sort of 12 months to 18 months; and then the remaining third probably represent ongoing costs of group supervision that we expect to incur both in response to the group supervision in New Jersey as well as the engagement that we have on an international basis as well. Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Nigel, this is Steve. I'd like to jump back in and just expand a bit on the question you asked about Annuities ROA; because in my response to that I mentioned the variable selling costs. And I think I'd like to put overall expense profile of the U.S. businesses year-over-year into context. In the overnight calls a few different people inquired about the increases in expenses in the U.S. businesses and I think the numbers that you were looking at very much included those variable selling costs. We look at our operating expenses exclusive of those costs, because those costs naturally go up and down with our sales levels and in a robust sales quarter, which we hope to continue, they were elevated this quarter. Year-over-year, the operating expenses in the U.S. businesses exclusive of variable selling costs were up 3%. That 3% includes normal inflationary adjustments. It also includes substantial investments that we are making in the current and future growth of our businesses and growth of their earnings. You're going to hear more about these investments in our guidance call next month, but suffice it to say for right now, we already see these investments paying off. I just call out a couple of examples. In PGIM, the investments we made in our distribution capabilities and in our product range have continued to drive flows and profitability in the business; and in Group Insurance the investments we made for example in disability claims management has been a big part of the earnings progress of that business. We also are making significant investments in our financial wellness value proposition and advancing that into the marketplace. And we're continuing to see a favorable impact, especially at the employer level. Since we embarked on this, call it a year-and-a-half plus ago, the financial wellness initiative has accounted for about $100 million in group premiums, which we consider to be an early indication of the success of this. But, like I say, these investments are already included in that 3% growth. The reason we're able to make these types of investments and still show very \u2013 a moderate and well-controlled expense growth is that we continue to \u2013 as Mark mentioned in his comments, we continue to find opportunities to create cost effectiveness and cost savings in the kind of call it, business as usual platforms for our businesses. It's not been our usual practice to make big announcements about finding these cost savings and to call them out with major cost \u2013 with major charges taken in association. This is part of our DNA; this is what we do year in, year out; quarter in, quarter out. And so again, we're able to make significant investments while showing well-controlled expense growth. Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Nadel with UBS. Please go ahead. John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC : Hi, good morning everybody. I have two questions on PGIM. The first is, if we think about the base asset management fees, it looks like that's trending very nicely and sort of in line with your expectations. Other revenues are maybe \u2013 what we used to think of as the incentive and transaction sort of revenues, were pretty low this quarter, frankly lowest we have seen in several years. I'm just curious whether that's more of a function of a mix shift where we ought to expect that that contribution is going to be lower on a go forward basis or is there just timing issue here? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: John, it's Steve. I'll address that question. We don't really think in terms of the run rate on the other related revenue because of the inherent variability of it. We have observed \u2013 just to be helpful, we have observed in the recent past that the mathematical average of that over the past few years has been right around the $50 million range, but I think we've also been careful to caution against looking at that as a run rate. What drove the lower number this quarter was a couple of things. Lower agency production, which is again going to be inherently variable quarter-to-quarter, but where we continue to see solid growth year in year out in our agency production. And the second is strategic investing. Strategic investing for us is very much associated with the extension of our product design and the launch of new product and the investment of seed money in those products. This quarter we put some seed money and did some strategic investing in some global and emerging market strategies, and emerging markets had a tough quarter. So that is just kind of associated with the extension of the product design. John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC : Understood, that's helpful. And then just a bit broader question but \u2013 obviously PGIM runs a general account. I'm just wondering what the investment side of the house is thinking in terms of where we are in the credit cycle, how close to a turn and what if anything you're doing with the general account, maybe reposition to get a bit more defensive as we get later and later in the cycle. Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: So John, it's Rob. Let me take a whack at that. So first, we look at credit management investing as one of our core strengths. We have a very strong investment portfolio. We carefully manage that to concentration limits and we're really disciplined about ALM; it is one of the core strengths of the organization and I think as \u2013 you've seen the manifestation of that in how we perform cycle in and cycle out. Our standard portfolio frankly is more defensive than you will find if you look at the industry benchmarks. We hold a larger-than-typical portfolio of government bonds, driven in part by our business in Japan, but it's in excess of a third of the portfolio in the general account and in excess of 40%, 45% of the \u2013 of our fixed maturities are actually in U.S. or JGBs or other government bonds. The below investment grade portion of our portfolio is only around 4%; and within that some 60% to two-thirds of that is actually in private placements which is of a significantly higher caliber than what you're going to find if you look at below investment grade publicly traded securities. We are underweight energy, finance and telecom; and by contrast we overweight things like consumer noncyclical utilities and transportation. And then when you look at the mortgages that we hold, the real estate portfolio, we are overweight in multifamily and industrial and we are underweight in office and retail; and so that would play itself well to, if you sort of think about how cycles play out. So we don't really manage the portfolio up and down in anticipation of the cycle. We do, do things on the margin obviously and \u2013 but if you look at how the portfolio was managed sort of throughout the cycle, what you would find is, it is conservative vis-\u00e0-vis our peers. Two other things I'd probably want to throw on to that to think about, John. We leverage PGIM. So, PGIM is one of the ten largest global investment managers with a real franchise in fixed income and our general account benefits by that both in terms of their overall expertise and then very specifically with regard to their ability to generate private placements and privately originated commercial mortgages for the portfolio. These are much higher quality than we find, again in the public marketplaces or that might be agented and underwritten by brokers. And those securities have a really attractive risk return profile that's associated with them. And all of that produces \u2013 if you look at our Kenya loss experience, what you're going to find is, it's below our benchmarks, it's below what we embedded in our pricing and all of that includes having gone through the financial crisis when you sort of look at those statistics. The second thing I want to mention \u2013 since you brought the topic up, if you don't mind is that I've seen a number of research reports that try to look at credit exposure for us and others in the industry by looking at kind of a leverage ratio, looking at the assets on the balance sheet as contrasted or measured against the equity on the balance sheet. And I think that's an interesting and potentially helpful way to look at exposure to credit, but ought to be sort of more nuanced ones than what I've seen to-date. And particularly, when I look at our ratio on that, on a superficial basis we would look to be on the higher end of our peers, but when you look at it on sort of the actual underlying credit leverage that we have, we're actually at the very low end of the peer group. And there is a couple things that are particularly noteworthy there that drive that. The first is, we have $80 billion of general account assets where we actually don't bear the credit exposure; it's passed through to the participating policies, like for instance our closed block which is some $60 billion of that in assets. And incidentally, when you look at the leverage ratio on a GAAP basis that actually has negative GAAP equity to the tune of about $1.7 billion. So, it throws those ratios off when you include something like that. As I mentioned before, we hold a significantly larger than typical portfolio of government bonds in around a third or so of the general account. So, our credit leverage, when you pull out both the \u2013 when you adjust for the government holdings and you adjust for the participating assets, the participating liabilities that we have is significantly lower. And then, there are some other adjustments that sort of feed into that, that are worth thinking about as well, like our foreign exchange re-measurement adjustment that we make when we calculate our return on equity. That's about $2.5 billion of incremental equity that is temporarily hung up in AOCI and really belongs in retained earnings. And we have very little goodwill; so when we look at those measures, our goodwill is like $850 million on the balance sheet. So probably adjusted, when you think about our credit leverage ratio using the construct that I've seeing in a number of reports. what you would see is that we are very, very low on that ratio, reflecting all the conservative management of the portfolio that I was articulating in the first part to your question. John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC : Point very well taken, thank you. If I can sneak one last in; I'm sorry. Just \u2013 Steve, you had mentioned that expenses were a bit higher maybe to the tune of something like two basis points to four basis points on the ROA and annuity. Charlie, I know you don't necessarily want to talk about the ones and twos in International overall, but is it fair for us to think about the lower level of expense in International being largely offset by the higher in Annuities? John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: I'm looking at Steve with that one because I'd... Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: I guess that's how it works out kind of mathematically, John, but I don't see \u2013 we don't see any particular correlation between the two. John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC : No, no, no, I'm not looking for \u2013 I'm not saying there is a correlation. Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Okay. John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC : I'm just wondering if they're roughly similar, that's all. John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Yeah, well, that's another way of getting at the question that was asked before, which is, how big is the number in International? So we're not really giving out a number. We're just saying that there were some expenses that were probably deferred to the fourth quarter. And then there were some good guys that fell our way. And those were in the $1 million here, $2 million there, $3 million there, but they added up to a material number. Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: So, John, its Rob. Let me just add one last comment onto that is \u2013 and I think it perhaps is what you are getting at. As we look at the quarter holistically, there were puts and takes. And so \u2013 and that's what you're articulating. And so when we look that result on an overall basis, what you're seeing is the benefit of having a diversified portfolio of businesses that are all high quality in and of themselves. But at any given point in time may produce results that are above or below what we would normally expect or see in a given quarter. And what you saw in this quarter is, International outperformed and some of our domestic businesses underperformed for the very specific reasons that we mentioned. And those things offset. So when we look at the holistic results for the quarter, we think you can look at that as representative of the totality of our businesses. John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks, Rob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with Citi. Please go ahead. Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Good morning. A few questions on capital. If I look at your year-to-date capital return measured against your AOI, I think you're tracking less than the 65% sort of free cash flow guidance. So any reason why maybe you're below that? And is there the potential to maybe accelerate buybacks, drawing down some of the holding company cash, which is at the high-end of your $3 billion to $5 billion range? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Suneet, it's Rob. So as we've articulated, and you've floated this, we think that about 65% of our operating earnings do translate into free cash flow. We've typically thought about redeploying that. And we redeploy it in a combination of dividends, so typically without being mathematical about it, within a range. We think about half that working its way back in the form of dividends to shareholders. And the other half of it we think about as redeploying either in the form of returns to shareholders, or we have the opportunity to deploy it into investments, which can grow our businesses inorganically. And so as we think about that, there is no reason to believe that our philosophy in that has changed at all. The mathematics of that can vary in any given quarter or within the year or for the year. But we have a very disciplined approach and a very thoughtful approach. And as we look at establishing our expectations for buybacks in a given year and our dividend policy in a given year, we refer back to \u2013 just the way you articulated it. And we've got 65% and that's available to either return to shareholders or to redeploy otherwise or to grow growth on behalf of \u2013 grow earnings on behalf of shareholder returns as well. Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then I guess my follow-up question. If I think about Lincoln's earnings call from last week, they brought up this idea of kind of using some of the legacy blocks in reinsurance transactions, bring capital to \u2013 even do more on the share repurchase side. Just given where your valuation is, and it's reasonably similar to where Lincoln's is, is that something that you guys have in the tool kit around capital. I really haven't heard you guys talk about that much. Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Suneet, Rob again. So, yeah, we are always reviewing opportunities to optimize capital management. And we're engaging with market participants to understand the range of opportunities that might be out there. I would note with respect to the specific Lincoln example that we generally have very well underwritten books. And we are not a distressed seller. And so any transaction would need to be economically compelling to us in light of what we think are the highly attractive economics associated with the portfolio that we've got. But I'll end with where I started, which is we are absolutely always reviewing those opportunities and seeking to optimize our capital management. Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And then if I could just sneak one more in on a related topic. Just on Long-Term Care. I mean we've heard on different calls that private equity is kind of sniffing around Long-Term Care blocks. Are you guys hearing anything in that regard with respect to your block? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: I wouldn't change the answer that I gave you to the prior question, Suneet, which is Long-Term Care would be included in that evaluation that we do in the things that we evaluate. Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Rob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Erik James Bass - Autonomous Research US LP : Hi, thank you. Your group margins continue to be favorable relative to your guidance at the beginning of the year. And I think this has been a consistent trend we've seen across the industry and others have talked about expecting this to continue near-term. So I guess as you look at your experience, is there any reason to think that you couldn't continue to turn the \u2013 kind of the favorable end of your guidance range? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Erik, this is Steve. I'll address your question. I think you're quite right in observing that we've been at the positive end of the range, the low end of the range or below. And that's for certain kind of fundamental reasons that we've spoken about, including well underwritten business and effective claims management. We do think that these trends that we've created in the business are for solid fundamental reasons and that that bodes well for their sustainability. We're not prepared right now to offer any change in the guidance we've previously given. But you're quite right in noting where we are and in the fact that favorable positioning is driven by fundamentals. Erik James Bass - Autonomous Research US LP : Thank you. And then maybe if I could ask a bigger picture question just around your M&A interest. I'm curious if there's any change in your areas of focus, I guess particularly given the wellness initiatives and your belief in the ability to cross-sell and leverage employee relationships. Does this change your level of interest in Group or Retirement businesses or other platforms that would bring on kind of more employer-employee relationships? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Erik, this is Steve again. We are quite interested in various opportunities as they may arise. We feel very good about our ability to kind of build the customer engagement funnel that we have in our financial wellness offering. Obviously the top of that funnel starts with the employer business \u2013 businesses as you mentioned of Group and Full Service Retirement and we're very alert to opportunities as they exist in addition to the organic growth that we've been able to sustain and in fact accelerate in various of our lines of business as witnessed by our strong Group sales earlier in the year and our strong Full Service sales throughout this year, including in particular this quarter. As we assess those opportunities, we will very much look at them in the context of the lifetime value of the customer because we feel we have built a capability to engage with customers throughout that engagement funnel in ways that will enable us to offer solutions to those customers that help them achieve their financial objectives and help us achieve that lifetime value. Having said that we will continue our longstanding approach of being a disciplined acquirer. And as we previously noted, some of the Group transactions that have taken place in the marketplace have taken place at multiples that let's just say have been highly elevated. But that's not to say that we don't continue to look for those opportunities, even as we continue to build momentum in our organic ability to expand that top of the funnel. Erik James Bass - Autonomous Research US LP : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi, first question I have is just a follow-up on the Annuities ROA. I think in the past you guys have talked about a 115 basis points sort of long-term ROA target. Could you talk about, are you seeing any of the drivers that would drive you down towards the 115 basis points from sort of the 120s plus that you have seen previously? I mean, are hedging costs ticking up and is there any offset from interest rates that might allow that long term target to be higher? Robert Michael Falzon - Prudential Financial, Inc.: So, Alex, its Rob. Let me take part of that and then I'll turn it over to Steve to talk about sort of the longer term trends and specifically around the hedging piece of it. So, let just sort of provide a little bit of a backdrop and then talk about hedging costs specifically. But if you look at our hedge effectiveness during the course of the quarter, it was 97% effectiveness; and then if you roll that forward and look at the month of October, given there was significantly higher volatility in October, we were still in excess of 90% hedge effectiveness. So, on a year-to-date basis through the end of October we actually had 99% hedge effectiveness. When we talk about hedge effectiveness, that includes the cost of hedging in that effectiveness and that cost of hedging is included in the AOI results that you're seeing in the current quarter and prior quarters. So there has been \u2013 when you look year-over-year, we called out in our release the increase in hedging costs; but that was really just \u2013 that wasn't sequential, that was year-over-year, because when you look at the third quarter of last year, that was before we put into place the refinements in the hedging strategy that we introduced in the fourth quarter which allowed us to sort of reduce the level of variability and outcomes, given the very high economic results that we are getting out of the Annuities business by adjusting the equity hedges that we had in the portfolio. So, that was in place both in last quarter and this quarter; it just wasn't in place a year ago. So when we look at the hedging costs, there isn't a bias toward that producing pressure on our ROAs on a go forward basis. The cost we're incurring from hedging are within a range of our expectations. So with that let me turn it over to Steve to sort of talk about longer-term prospects. Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Alex, I spoke earlier about a couple of specific costs that are affecting this quarter's ROA. In addition to that as we previously pointed out, there was one factor that will produce very, very gradually over a multi-year period some pressure on the ROA, and that is the emergence of more of our business \u2013 the maturation of more of our business and its emergence into lower fee tiers. This is a very common pricing practice in the Annuities industry that the fee tiers lower some time at or after the end of the surrender charge period. And the facts are simple : we wrote a lot of highly profitable business in Annuities in the 2009, 2010, 2011 years when equity markets were suppressed and it was a good time to take on this risk. We were writing that business even as many participants in the market were pulling way back. So we do have a meaningful amount of business now emerging beyond the surrender charge period and into these lower fee tiers. But the emergence of that impact I will emphasize again is very, very gradual and occurs over a multi-year period. Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you. And maybe just a quick follow-up on Full Service. Can you quantify at all like how much of the positive flow experience and volume growth you've been getting is from sort of the initiatives that you've been undertaking with LINK in expanding your platform? Stephen P. Pelletier - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Alex, Steve again. We feel that over the past several quarters, as we've advanced the financial wellness value proposition into the marketplace that that financial wellness offering has been accountable for, let me call it some $5 billion of our Full Service sales. So a healthy contribution to our momentum in the business. Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I will turn the call back to John Strangfeld for closing remarks. John Robert Strangfeld - Prudential Financial, Inc.: Thank you very much. I'd just like to bring this back and close it with a few final thoughts. It's been a privilege to lead our company over the last 11 years and parenthetically 44 earnings calls during which we've significantly evolved and grown our business and delivered innovative solutions to our customers. And I'd like to personally thank all of our employees for their dedication and support as they are at the cornerstone of the company's success; success in delivering value to our customers, our community, and our stakeholders. And I'd also like to recognize the extraordinary partnership I have had enjoyed with Mark over the last 11 years, which is highly productive, personally enriching and an incredible and unforgettable example of the power of partnership, one that's based on mutual respect, complementary skills, and trust. And I look forward to Charlie and Rob experiencing the same kind of partnership as they moved forward, working together with an outstanding management team. With that, I'd like to thank you very much for your time and attention and wish you a good day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. We thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive TeleConference Service. You may now disconnect.",

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.  And I would now like to turn the conference over to the Head of Investor Relations, Darin Arita. Please go ahead, sir. Darin Arita : Thank you, Brad. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today's call are Charlie Lowrey, CEO; Rob Falzon, Vice Chairman; Steve Pelletier, Head of Domestic Businesses; Scott Sleyster, Head of International Businesses; Ken Tanji, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared remarks by Charlie, Rob and Ken, and then we will take your questions.  Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of such measures to the comparable GAAP measures and a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, please see the slide titled Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures in the appendix to today's presentation, which can be found on our website at investor.prudential.com.  With that, I'll hand it over to Charlie. Charles Lowrey : Thank you, Darin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. While equity market movements affected our fourth quarter results, our fundamentals remained strong across our businesses, as did our earnings, adjusted for the notable items that Ken will address later. We feel good about our outlook for our business and our ability to continue building the momentum in our business by helping our customers with their financial needs, especially through turbulent times. And we're going to dive into this subject in a little more detail today.  For the full year, 2018 marked another important chapter for Prudential as we continued to generate meaningful value for our customers and to grow our business in a sustainable way. As a result, we grew operating earnings and adjusted book value per share, produced a double-digit return on equity and returned more than $3 billion via dividends and share repurchases. We also maintained a solid balance sheet even amid the large equity market movements in the fourth quarter. Looking forward, we are excited about the opportunities to create more value for our existing customers and forge relationships with new customers. Our market-leading businesses, complementary capabilities and global reach allow us to expand markets and grow in a way that few others can.  At the highest level, we're bringing more financial opportunity to more customers. We accomplish this through our U.S. Financial Wellness businesses; PGIM, our asset management business; and our International business. We are also working with institutional clients and distributors around the world to help individuals adopt behaviors that enable financial security. By addressing evolving societal needs for financial advice, services and solutions, we seek a unique opportunity to reach new market segments across different income brackets, ages and other demographic groups and to deepen our relationships with existing customers.  PGIM enables the success of our businesses through its investment capabilities, including proprietary private asset classes. This provides a competitive advantage for Prudential, which allows us to innovate new products and services, such as pension risk transfer, to support our customers. At the same time, PGIM benefits from continued growth in affiliate flows and assets under management, which supports its position as the top 10 global asset manager. Our businesses have an established, trusted presence in more than 40 countries, engaging in relationships with approximately 50 million individuals. In addition to this wide reach, our businesses create earnings and capital diversification for our shareholders.  Turning to Slide 3. I'll provide some additional financial highlights on the fourth quarter and the full year. Fourth quarter earnings declined from a year-ago period primarily due to equity market impacts. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share increased by 11% to $11.69. We generated an adjusted return on operating equity for the full year 2018 of 12.7%, at the high end of our near to intermediate target of 12% to 13%. And our book -- our adjusted book value per share grew by 8.3%. We deploy our capital in growing our business, repurchasing shares and paying dividends. And we achieved all of this while maintaining a robust capital position consistent with our AA standard. As we look to 2019, our share repurchase authorization is $2 billion, and we increased the quarterly dividend by 11%.  This year's performance was supported by strong drivers across our businesses, including significant milestones. Within our U.S. Financial Wellness businesses, we achieved record account values in Institutional Investment products, supported by our pension risk transfer capabilities. We also had record full-service retirement sales. Within PGIM, we achieved our 16th consecutive year of positive institutional net flows. Within International, we reached a record level of Life Planners, our highly productive distributors of protection and retirement solutions.  Maintaining this growth and executing on our strategy starts from within. We focus on culture and talent, enabled by technology, to achieve a meaningful purpose, which is a point I'd like to close with as we turn to Slide 4.  There's a growing body of evidence that purpose-driven companies outperform their competition in recruiting and retaining top talent, in strengthening customer loyalty and in driving business performance, all of which are core elements of our strategy. At the start of this year, we unveiled a new purpose statement to our employees that reflects their collective feedback of our vision for the future, which is we make clients better by solving the financial challenges of a changing world. We recognize this is a bold and highly aspirational statement, but it reflects who we are and what we do through our U.S. Financial Wellness and global businesses. And to that effect, I'm proud to note that we continue to be recognized for our purpose-driven work. Prudential was, once again, ranked as #1 on Fortune Magazine's 2019 World's Most Admired Companies list for the fourth consecutive year in our sector, with high marks in areas such as innovation and people management. Additionally, as we noted last quarter, Prudential was named to Fortune's Global Change the World list, where we are the only company in our sector to be recognized. Finally, we were cited as one of the Top 50 Companies for Diversity by DiversityInc in 2018 for the 17th year in a row. These distinctions serve as a strong endorsement for the culture we cultivate at Prudential every single day and which we will continue to build on to drive shareholder value and make a positive contribution to society. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob, who will provide an update on how our businesses are executing on their key priorities. Rob? Robert Falzon : Thank you, Charlie. I'll begin on Slide 5. Consistent with our aspiration to solve the financial challenges of our customers, which Charlie described, we are already advancing our purpose through our Financial Wellness initiative in the U.S. and through our needs-based selling approach in our International business. Our resiliency to the equity market fluctuations in the fourth quarter was the result of what we believe are the hallmarks of Prudential : thoughtful strategy and quality execution that build strong fundamentals and produce attractive financial outcomes. Our objective is to apply these strengths in ways that produce similar outcomes for our customers, who can benefit from our integrated solutions, market access and enduring financial strength.  In the U.S., we do this through Financial Wellness. We engage with individuals and, in particular, the employees of our workplace clients to identify and solve their unique financial challenges through multiple channels and with simplified solutions. This also benefits our employer clients by enhancing the effectiveness and engagement of their employees. Our value proposition is resonating as we generate outcomes such as reduced financial stress, improved understanding and utilization of company benefit programs and increased productivity.  As shown on Slide 6, U.S. Financial Wellness represents our Workplace and Individual Solutions businesses and produces a diversified source of earnings, including fees, net investment spread and underwriting income delivered through our Retirement, Group Insurance, Individual Annuities and Individual Life platforms. Workplace Solutions covers 20 million people, and Individual Solutions serves over 5 million people. The capabilities we have in this platform enable us to engage with our clients through a continuum of channels, including with third-party distributors, directly with our in-person or phone-based financial advisers and with our digital tools. Our goal is to meet individuals' needs where, how and when they want. I'll highlight three of our key priorities for growth. First, we continue to develop solutions to address customers' financial needs. As an example, we recently launched emergency savings feature for our retirement plan clients. This solution allows individuals to access funds for short-term needs while maintaining their contributions toward their long-term goals. Second, as we continue to provide our Financial Wellness solutions to our existing workplace clients, these solutions are also contributing to new client acquisition efforts. Since the launch of our Financial Wellness capabilities in 2015, we have generated about $9 billion of full-service retirement plan sales and over $100 million in Group Insurance case wins that we can attribute to this initiative. Third, we are working to deepen individual relationships in the workplace. We activate these relationships through our Prudential Pathways program, our digital Financial Wellness platform and LINK by Prudential.  Our Prudential Pathways program has been adopted by nearly 500 of our workplace clients. In this program, employees of our workplace clients can participate in work site financial seminars on a wide range of topics delivered by Prudential's financial advisers. Employees can also request a personal consultation, which has helped drive new retail clients for Prudential advisers.  Our digital Financial Wellness platform has been adopted by over 3,000 clients, representing over 5 million individuals. This platform provides a digital venue to address a variety of individuals' needs, including education on financial wellness topics, assessment of financial needs and tools to take action. We launched LINK by Prudential in the second half of 2018. Our workplace clients can make LINK available to their employees as part of our digital Financial Wellness platform. This is a highly personalized online experience that helps those employees customize financial goals; connect with advisers digitally or via phone; and obtain savings, investment, protection and income solutions.  As we continue to help employers and individuals, we ultimately believe our solutions can significantly expand our addressable market and enhance our long-term growth potential. Turning to Slide 7, which highlights our global asset management business, PGIM. PGIM continues to leverage its scale of over $1 trillion of assets under management via a distinctive, multi-manager model with broad asset class capabilities. 2018 marks the 16th consecutive year of positive institutional third-party net flows for PGIM. These positive net flows from third parties are in part driven by our strong long-term investment performance. I would specifically highlight the 5-year performance and note that 97% of the assets under management have outperformed their benchmarks over that period. In the current quarter, we experienced net third-party outflows of $3 billion, including a $9 billion fixed-income withdrawal by a single institutional client. This was a client-specific decision and was not based on our investment performance. We serve many of the world's largest pension funds and other institutional investors and, as a result, will experience large idiosyncratic flows from time to time. These flows are generally to the benefit of PGIM's AUM.  Our third-party retail flows were affected by trends consistent with the industry during the quarter. Retail investors reduced credit exposure, held more cash and sold investments for tax purposes. Our total net inflows, including affiliate inflows, were positive $9 billion in the quarter. These flows included significant assets from pension risk transfer, where PGIM's origination and differentiated asset management capabilities provide a competitive advantage. The positive flows helped to keep PGIM's total assets under management fairly stable through the quarter despite the market decline and in contrast to significant declines experienced by other asset managers. Despite industry-wide fee compression, our overall asset management fee yield remained stable at 22 basis points as we continue to diversify our product suite into higher-yielding strategies.  I'll highlight three other key priorities to grow PGIM's earnings. First, with respect to expanding our global footprint. As of year-end 2018, 29% of PGIM's assets under management were sourced from outside the U.S. We continue to grow organically, driven in part by our strong international private origination capabilities. In fact, PGIM had a record year for non-U.S. private credit originations. In addition, PGIM's European mutual fund platform has grown to include 28 funds, with assets under management in excess of $3 billion. Second, we have also made disciplined bolt-on acquisitions to strengthen our global presence and complement our capabilities. For example, we recently announced the acquisition of a London-based quantitative investment manager that will expand our alternative investment solutions. The manager will have significantly greater growth potential by tapping into PGIM's global distribution network.  Third, with respect to products, we launched our first actively managed, exchange-traded fund last year. And by year-end, the ETF platform has grown to 6 strategies across both equity and fixed income. In addition, we continue to grow our market-leading alternatives capabilities and have established a dedicated group in our leading private client franchise focused on mezzanine financing, energy finance and direct lending. Now turning to Slide 8. Our International business includes our world-class Japanese life insurance operation as well as other businesses, including in high-growth markets with large populations such as Brazil, India, Indonesia, China and Africa. Our differentiated business models and proven ability to execute our strategy have led to steady growth, attractive returns and significant capital generation. In addition, we continue to make strategic investments in digital, mobile and data capabilities to enhance our long-term growth prospects. I will highlight a few operating metrics that reflect our strong fundamentals and continued growth during the fourth quarter. Life Planner sales, which were about half of total International sales in the current quarter, increased by 12% compared to the year-ago quarter. This was driven by higher U.S. dollar sales and the number of Life Planners in Japan increasing by 6% to a record level of 4,183.  Gibraltar sales were lower than a year ago as growth in Life Consultant and independent agency sales were offset by a reduction in bank channel sales. Bank channel sales reflect our discipline on pricing and underwriting in response to a more competitive market. Life Consultant channel sales were 5% higher than the year-ago quarter, even as Life Consultant count was 4% lower, consistent with our continued focus on high-quality distribution. And independent agency channel sales increased by 10%, driven by an increase in U.S. dollar sales, including a new term life insurance product rolled out earlier in the year.  In summary, our momentum remains positive across all of our businesses : U.S. Financial Wellness, PGIM and International. We have thoughtful strategies and quality execution that continue to build strong fundamentals as we serve our customers well. And we are monetizing those fundamentals to generate profitable growth at attractive returns. And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken. Kenneth Tanji : Okay. Thanks, Rob. Slide 9 includes the notable items which had an impact on adjusted operating results in the current quarter. We highlight these items because they may not be indicative of future performance. There were 3 primary drivers of the notable items. First, the equity market movements resulted in a $109 million adjustment for the recognition of certain benefits and costs associated with variable annuities and variable life policies. In addition, non-coupon investment income and prepayment fees were about $140 million below our long-term expectations, driven primarily by hedge fund returns. Second, underwriting experience was generally in line with our average expectations, which highlights our complementary mortality and longevity profile, as presented on Page 22 in the appendix. And third, we recorded a provision of $30 million for legal matters. In total, these notable items reduced pretax earnings by $289 million or $0.54 per share. Excluding the notable items, earnings per share would be $2.98, up 14% from the year-ago quarter. And in thinking about quarterly earnings patterns, we -- please note that we've included a summary of seasonal items in the appendix. Now turning to Slide 10. I'll provide an update on capital deployment, liquidity and leverage. As Charlie noted, we returned more than $3 billion to shareholders during the year through dividends and share repurchases. And for 2019, we increased our share repurchase authorization by 33% to $2 billion, and yesterday, we announced an 11% increase in our quarterly dividend. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company amounted to $5.5 billion at the end of the quarter. The sequential quarter increase of $300 million was driven by cash flows from our businesses that exceeded shareholder distributions. Shareholder distributions of $752 million in the quarter were roughly evenly split between dividends and share repurchases. We also maintained a strong balance sheet. Our hedging programs were highly effective in mitigating the large equity movements in the quarter. Our regulatory capital ratios continue to be above our AA financial strength targeted levels, and our financial leverage ratio as of year-end 2018 remains better than our target. Also, as credit remains a topic of investor interest, we provided details of our high-quality CLO portfolio in the appendix.  In summary and turning to Slide 11, our market-leading global businesses with complementary capabilities are providing integrated financial wellness solutions to more customers. For the year, we generated a strong adjusted operating return on equity, along with significant growth in adjusted operating earnings and book value per share and also delivered solid shares and net flows across our businesses. And we distributed more than $3 billion to shareholders and sustained a robust capital position with capital flexibility. Now I'll turn it to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from the line of Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Humphrey Lee : Regarding PGIM's net outflows, I mean, the $9 billion outflow from single client, I was wondering if you can elaborate in terms of the reason for the redemption. Was it related to hedging costs for being foreign investors or maybe the client taking the investment in-house? I was just hoping if you can share a little bit more color. And then also, do you still have any more exposure to this particular client? Stephen Pelletier : Humphrey, this is Steve. I will take your question. Thank you very much for it. I would say that the reason for this outflow was the client looking to consolidate managers, and that was really the main driving factor. It was not due to our performance, either on a relative or an absolute basis. So that's the story there. If you don't mind, even on a no-names basis, I don't think I'll talk too much about -- at the granular level, of our dealings with an individual client. I will just emphasize, Humphrey, that, as Charlie talked about, our PGIM business represents a top 10 global asset manager. In particular, I'd highlight that on the institutional front, we truly have a world-class client franchise. We do business with 23 of the largest 25 corporate U.S. pension plans. We do business with 8 of the top 10 Fortune 500 companies. We do business with over half of the 300 largest global pension funds. We're very proud of and grateful for that client franchise, but it also means that business gets done in large blocks. And on occasion, on rare occasion, on a quarterly basis, we may have more outflows than inflows due to something like this, a single large case. However, on an annual basis, as mentioned earlier, we have had 16 positive years of institutional net flows. And also, I'd like to point out that on the quarterly basis, despite that one large outflow of $9 billion, we almost thought institutional net flows to withdraw, which signifies that gross sales were actually very strong for the quarter. And that gives us confidence, as we begin 2019, in our ability to attract robust flows, both gross and net, and at a good and sustainable average fee level, as Rob mentioned in his comments. Humphrey Lee : Understood. And I agree, the $8.5 billion of other net inflows definitely speak volume to your -- the demand for your product. My second question is related to the weak non-coupon investment income in the quarter. My understanding is that most of your hedge fund exposure has no reporting lag, and the underperformance in the fourth quarter was fully reflected in the numbers in the quarter, so that included the weaker December results. And then on that note, of the $140 million of below-plan non-coupon investment income, how much of that was related to hedge fund underperformance? And how should we think about the first quarter expectation? Like, obviously, private equity will be weaker, but I guess your hedge fund results could be an offset. Robert Falzon : So, Humphrey, it's Rob. I'll take that question. So first, yes, our hedge funds are not lagged. So the full effect of the market performance in the fourth quarter is reflected in our hedge fund performance and, therefore, our overall alternatives performance. And if you look at the performance vis-a-vis our long-term expectations, the vast majority of that would be attributable to that hedge fund performance in the quarter. There were small pieces from other components, but I would say, again, the vast majority of it was related to the hedge funds. Hedge funds are about 25% or so of the overall alternatives portfolio, Humphrey. And if you look at the performance in the quarter, just helpful to put some context around that, the performance in the quarter for our hedge fund portfolio overall was down around 2.5%. I would compare that to the overall market being down 14%, both the S&P and the MSCI World Index. If you look over a little longer time frame, look at the full fiscal year, our hedge funds actually had positive performance for the year. They're up about 0.5% or so. And again, contrasting that to the S&P, which was down around 6% for the year, and the MSCI World Index, which was down over 10% for the year, I think it speaks to the diversification and quality of the hedge fund performance that we had and the portfolio that we've got. It's a well-diversified portfolio. We're in about 40 or so different funds, and it's diversified by strategy and its sources of alpha, including things like the asset class, geography, sector and time horizons. Bigger picture, if you look at our alternatives performance, I think it's also helpful to keep in mind that, that performance, over a long period of time, has actually been quite strong. So if we go back to the inception of the program, which was back in the fourth quarter of 2012, and you look at that performance versus our long-term expectations, we've actually exceeded it by around $550 million or about 20% of the total returns over that period of time. So again, speaks to the discipline that we have around the management of that alternatives portfolio. With respect to the first quarter of 2019 and PEs, as you sort of specifically asked, most of our PE funds are lagged, and they are also about 25% of the overall alternatives portfolio. And our private equity or PE has some positive correlations with the market, but it's less direct than what you would see in the hedge funds because it's influenced by things like realizations. And there were a number of those in the fourth quarter. And also, a number of the private equity funds are mark-to-model versus mark-to-market, and you come up with different results as a result of that as well.  So more broadly, if we look at the performance over the long term, we have the statistics that I mentioned before, and we think that that's the appropriate emphasis of this as opposed to kind of looking at a quarter-by-quarter kind of analysis. If I can just sort of head off a follow-on question, which I know is coming from -- either from you or from some caller or another, let me just sort of hit it because I think as you're talking about the outlook for the first quarter on alternatives, there's sort of the broader issue of the 2019 outlook versus the guidance that we've provided. As you know, we don't provide forward-looking statements in the context of guidance, but I can make some observations about our current conditions. First, fundamentals, as you heard in our opening remarks, for the fourth quarter are actually quite strong across our businesses, and they're demonstrating good momentum as we head into 2019. And adjusting for the impact of the December market decline, our fourth quarter financial results actually reflect that very strong performance. With respect to the markets, we've provided the assumptions that underlie our guidance in our guidance deck that we went through at the end of last year. And while the markets swooned in December, the current levels are actually pretty consistent with the assumptions that underlie the guidance that we provided. So I'll then leave you and others to draw your own conclusions from those observations, but I thought that, that might be helpful additional context. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Nigel Dally with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Dally : Broader question on the investment portfolio. Can you discuss your views as to where we are within the credit cycle and what positioning you're looking at making? In light of escalating concern about a turn in the cycle, also in light of that, now just given the performance metric that you highlighted for your non-coupon, would it be fair to say that they're performing as you originally intended, and if so, you're not looking to change any of the allocation to hedge funds looking forward? Robert Falzon : Nigel, it's Rob again. So let me take the second part of your question first, which is, yes, our performance is consistent with expectations given where we are in the cycle. And our discipline around that portfolio construction is consistent, and we're not looking to make any significant changes in that either with regard to sort of the ultimate size of the portfolio or the component parts of the portfolio and the relevant weightings that we have in there. Obviously, there's variability quarter to quarter or year to year, depending on drawdowns that we get, particularly from private equity and in real estate. But largely, no strategic changes in that. With respect to your first point in terms of the portfolio and positioning for the credit cycle, I'll start with 2 points. One, portfolio is really well diversified, and we manage it within credit limit exposures for things like individual names, sectors, asset types and credit ratings. So a lot of discipline around making sure that the diversification goes deep into the portfolio. Second, the positioning of the portfolio for a downturn is actually not new for us. We started this over the last year or two. And as we've gotten further into the cycle, we've been further taking risk off the table. A couple of examples of that. First, we've been diversifying our corporate exposure, particularly in longer durations. So I think as we've noted multiple times in the past, we hold a larger-than-typical portfolio of government bonds. It's about 36% of the general account and almost half of our fixed maturities. We've been adding to munis in lieu of corporates. And we've been rotating out of bonds that have been at risk of credit migration ahead of the downgrades. And as we've also noted before, we're underweight in energy, finance and telecom, and we're overweight in consumer noncyclical utilities and transportation. We've also been selling our high-yield public exposure and shortening the duration of that portfolio.  And where we've had appetite, we've been replacing it with privates, which now account for about 60% of our below-investment-grade portfolio and about 16% of our overall privates portfolio. Our history or experience with our privates in below investment grade and, actually, investment grade as well is that they have significantly lower defaults and higher recoveries. Combination of that leads to loss experience, which is substantially in excess of the benchmarks on a credit quality equivalent basis that we find in the public marketplace. In aggregate, our below-investment-grade portfolio is only about 4% of the general account. Our commercial mortgages are underweight multi-family and industrial -- I'm sorry, overweight at multi-family and industrial, and we've under-weighted the more cyclically sensitive property types like office and retail. And like our private placements, it's directly originated, so it's a very high-quality portfolio with structural protections built into it by virtue of that direct private origination. And as Ken noted in his opening remarks and you see in the exhibit to our deck, with regard to our structured investments and particularly CLOs, we are focused on the highest-quality tranches with significant structural enhancement in those investments. I think the broader point is that portfolio management is one of our core strengths. The portfolio is defensively positioned, as I just articulated. It's managed the concentration limits that I spoke to. And we're also very discipline around ALM, asset-liability matching, which is sort of key to this as well. We've highlighted in the past different issues that have come up. So we talked about asset leverage during our guidance call, and we provided an exhibit on that. And what we showed is that, properly adjusted, our asset leverage is actually very comparable to our peers. And more importantly, our credit leverage is actually at the very low end of the range of our peers. In this deck, as I just noted, we've included something on CLOs. And you can see that our exposure is entirely comprised not just of NAIC 1 but of AAA tranches, so even more high-quality within the range of NAIC 1 that are well underwritten and benefit from significant subordination levels. And then, I guess, the thing that's come up more recently that we haven't actually spoken to, so I'll take the opportunity to do it, is we're seeing some research around credit impairment history. Our own experience on that has been well below our benchmarks. It's below what we've been embedding in our pricing.  And all of that includes our experience with the financial crisis, including the experience that we and others went through with subprime. If we replicate our portfolio for the calculation that's being produced out there, and that calculation is looking at after-tax impairments and we've assumed that those impairments also include credit loss sales, and comparing that to average total investment assets for the period from, I think, the statistics that are out there from January of 2008 through September of 2018, our actual losses, excluding the Closed Block, are 0.73%, so 73 basis points in aggregate across that period. If we roll that forward to the end of the year, it only moves by 2 or 3 basis points. So again, I think what you would find is that's at the very low end of the performance of our peers -- or very high end from a performance standpoint, low end from a loss standpoint. None of this is to imply that we will be immune to a credit cycle, but we would expect, consistent with our historical experience through prior cycles, to weather it well. That's due to defensive posturing of the portfolio, as I've gone through, and the investment advantages we derive from PGIM that Charlie spoke about in his opening remarks, specifically its ability to directly originate privates, which are now 11% to the general account and actually almost 1/3 of our corporates, and its ability to originate mortgages that I spoke to before as well as its strong track record of investment performance in publics.  And that's evidenced by the size of our operation and by the 16 consecutive years of positive third-party institutional flows coming into it. And due to the broader financial strength we have, as in the last cycle, we would expect to have the flexibility to be opportunistic in taking advantage of the more attractive investment environment and the more attractive acquisition environment that typically accompanies those sorts of downturns. So with that, hopefully, I fully answered your question. Nigel Dally : Absolutely. My second question was just on the escalation of the competition in the bank channel in Japan. Just wondering whether that's new entrants or is that existing players in the marketplace. Just a little more color as to what's going on there. Scott Sleyster : This is Scott, Nigel. I would say a couple of things about that. No, I don't think it's necessarily new entrants to the market, but it is new product offerings that they may be bringing to market. In particular, a number of people have been bringing in single premium and recurring premium to that marketplace. I think, perhaps, on a broader basis, I should say -- or talk about our approach to the bank channel. Out of all the channels that we have in Japan, it really is the more opportunistic. Our core Life Planner and Life Consultant models are really needs-based selling channels. They very much focus on protection-based life insurance. When you move into the bank channel, that's traditionally the most competitive. Various participants will come in throughout the cycle with aggressive pricing for one reason or another for various objectives that they might be achieving. Our model, I think, is highly disciplined. We're traditionally still selling protection insurance. We've got a lot of pricing discipline. And as we stick to that, we would expect to see quarter-to-quarter volatility in that channel. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of John Nadel with UBS. John Nadel : Just a question on pension risk transfer for the year. Could you just tell us what the net flows specifically for PRT were? I think you mentioned $16 billion gross sales. Stephen Pelletier : John, this is Steve. Our annual runoff on PRT is consistent with what we've communicated before, which is about $4 billion total, $3 billion on the funded side and $1 billion on the longevity risk transfer side. So that gets you to the flows. I would say that in terms of looking at the year that we're in now, we still see a very, very robust pipeline. I'm sure that some people may be thinking that the market volatility in the fourth quarter and what that did to funding levels in the aggregate across all pension funds may have an impact. And I would just point out that while that observation about some pullback in funding levels in the aggregate is true, virtually all the companies in the visible pipeline, first of all, are fully funded and, second of all, have taken steps to hedge their risk and to mitigate any capital markets impact. So we still see a very robust pipeline. We are still very confident in our ability to transact within the pipeline. I think that's borne out by our fourth quarter experience, where we had very strong flows of $7.5 billion in PRT total, $5.5 billion funded and the others -- the other longevity risk transfer. And I would also say that we see an opportunity, given the strength and given the kind of configuration of the pipeline for this year's experience, to possibly be less backloaded than the past several years have been. John Nadel : Okay. And then just a question for, I guess, Rob or Ken. Just specific to the fourth quarter results, could you just quantify for us how much was the seasonally higher expenses up relative to the average of the first 3 quarters? And then how much was offsetting that in the form of lower compensation-related expenses driven by your share price and the market decline? I think that runs through corporate. Kenneth Tanji : Yes. John, it's Ken. We had given guidance that, typically, our fourth quarter expenses are seasonally higher and range from about $125 million to $175 million. And we thought they would come in at the high end of that range, and they did, and about half of that occurred in corporate. And then in terms of the impact of our compensation expense from our long-term and deferred comp plans that are either linked to our share price or other market indexes, that had a benefit of about $90 million in the quarter, and about $70 million of that was in corporate and other. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Ryan Krueger : I guess ahead of the statutory statement being filed, I wanted to get your perspective on what your target RBC ratio will be, I guess, going forward versus the historical 400% post tax reform. Kenneth Tanji : Yes. So Ryan, it's Ken. We did adjust our RBC target, and we provided that with our guidance for 2019. Just a little bit of a reminder that with tax reform, we have a lower tax rate, and that improves our earnings today and in the future and strengthens the value of our deferred profits that reside in our reserves. So overall, the impact of tax reform is positive for us. It does lead to higher regulatory capital requirements. And so when we put that all together, our improved financial strength along with higher regulatory capital requirements, we did think an adjustment to our RBC ratio to 375% was -- made a lot of sense, and we've done that. And we would expect to -- and we'll file our statutory financials at the end of the month, and we would expect our RBC ratio for PICA to be above our objective. Ryan Krueger : And then on PGIM, I don't know if you can give us any perspective on January flows, if you've seen a rebound relative to the fourth quarter. Stephen Pelletier : Ryan, this is Steve. Without commenting on results in a given month, I would just say that we entered the year with a strong sense of confidence about our ability to continue to generate flows, as Rob touched upon. We operate across a range of asset classes : equity, public and private fixed income, real estate and mortgages and other sources of alternatives. So we feel -- and through our -- also, based on our strong investment performance, we feel very confident in our ability to generate flows this year. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Taylor Scott : The first one I had was just on the comments made earlier on the call around being well positioned for potential M&A opportunities. I mean, the holding company cash is quite strong. It sounds like you're probably above your RBC target, so that'll make sense. I'd just be interested on any color you'd have on what kind of M&A opportunities you'd be interested in. I mean, is it things that would target building out distribution and increasing volume growth? Would it be about expanding geographically further or maybe something with cost synergies? I mean, is it -- where would your focus be? Charles Lowrey : Sure. This is Charlie. Let me take a step back, if I may, and just talk about the stages of development of the company. And this will put your question into perspective, and we'll answer it along the way. But I'd characterize our development over the course of the past 20 years as having kind of 4 stages. And the first is the elimination of the financial supermarket. And we spent a couple of decades clearing out the underbrush, if you will. And during that process, we sold about 40 businesses for about $10 billion, and we discontinued several others. And we still are critically examining our businesses. So in the past number of years, we've sold the wealth management services business, retail real estate, global commodities and, most recently, our insurance business in Poland. So we've honed our business lines down to 3 specific areas, right, protection, asset management and retirement. That's what we're focused on. Which brings us to the second stage, which is in each of those businesses, we wanted to build world-class businesses, right? So we focused on performance of each of those individual businesses and increased, over time, the ROE significantly of each business. We made about $16 billion of acquisitions to augment the businesses we had, both domestically and internationally. And we'll continue to look for acquisitions as we go forward to augment these three lines of businesses, whether that's internationally or domestically. We were also opportunistic in acquiring talent during this period, especially during the Great Recession, both in terms of individuals and lift-outs of teams, and we continue to do that as we go forward. So then the third stage is once we had developed those businesses and they were at scale, we considered the diversification benefits of an operation -- of operational efficiencies between the different businesses. This can be capital diversification, which there's a great deal. It can be mortality or longevity balance. And as Steve talked about, we have a very, very good pipeline of longevity business. We're glad to have our insurance businesses because that can balance the longevity, which allows us to do the PRT business we do. And then we focus on efficiencies such as shared services between the businesses that create better customer experience and also cost savings. So we consider ideas that make us far more efficient in terms of operations and in terms of the use of capital by our businesses and the deployment of our capital to our stakeholders. And you've seen that through the increase in buybacks and dividend increases. And that really leads to the fourth stage. And that's the one we're in now, where we're fully integrating the entire business system to expand significantly our addressable market by completely focusing on our customer needs and reaching more of those customers through fully integrated workplace and digital channels. Hence, our focus on and increased discussion about financial wellness, which stems from our belief that we're uniquely positioned with our sets of complementary businesses to solve the changing needs of our clients as they consider insurance, savings and retirement. But to integrate the services we provide by combining elements from different businesses requires what I'd call real and selfless teamwork, which gets to the core of the success of this company, which is its culture. And it's our culture that enables us to work across businesses to provide relevant and timely solutions to our clients' most pressing financial needs and also to the communities in which we work, which is so -- which is such an important part of who we are, in other words, giving back. So it's this fourth stage that we're in and beginning to communicate to you about. And given that this is -- we're in this fourth stage, the kind of acquisitions we look at would be ones that would augment these 3 lines of business, either by bringing additional capabilities to those businesses or additional distribution over time. Internationally, you've seen us grow in Southeast Asia, in Latin America, in Africa, higher-growth markets to balance off the -- our presence in Northern Asia. And in the U.S., you would see us continue to consider transactions that would either, again, increase distribution or increase our capabilities in certain areas related to the U.S. Financial Wellness program. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of John Barnidge with Sandler O'Neill. John Barnidge : Most of my questions have been answered, but maybe how has the market volatility and the government shutdown changed the nature of conversations for your Workplace Solutions business over the last, call it, 6 weeks to a quarter? Stephen Pelletier : John, it's Steve. I'll answer your question. We do not see a significant impact of market volatility and the government shutdown, as you mentioned, in the group benefits business. Our engagement with corporate clients on that front continues to be very much around the strength of our value proposition and, in particular, the Financial Wellness value proposition. On the Retirement side, the other part of Workplace Solutions, I would not say there's a -- there's been a particular impact either, except to say that for those companies that are well funded and that are well positioned from an ALM standpoint and hedging their risk as it relates to capital markets movements, those -- frankly, the movements are a reminder that the time to transact may be here and take risk off the table in terms of any further capital markets movements. I would say that overall, though, the real engagement on the full-service Retirement front and on the Group Insurance front has been around the strength of our Financial Wellness proposition. Rob mentioned some of the numbers, $100 million of annualized group premium that stems directly from our Financial Wellness proposition and now $9 billion -- previously, the number we were citing to you last year was $6 billion. Now $9 billion of full-service sales directly attributed to the strength of that proposition. This is very much as we anticipated. As we developed this Financial Wellness strategy, we anticipated that the impact of it would -- in terms of our results would first be visible at the top of the funnel, if you will, at our work at the employer level with companies in their provision of retirement plans and benefit packages. As we continue to develop the customer engagement funnel, we are seeing very, very strong levels of engagement with that value proposition. It's interesting. If you compare our experience, for example, to a lot of the start-ups that have entered the space, our customer engagement levels and our client acquisition costs are a fraction of some of those start-ups, and frankly, client acquisition costs are the issue that a lot of those start-ups run into. And the reason is that the people we're seeking to engage know that they're already doing business with Prudential. They're already part of a retirement plan or a group benefits plan that is administered by Prudential. So we're confident that the engagement levels that we're seeing will lead to greater revenues from our engagement with individuals and our providing them the solutions that address their financial needs. In fact, we're already seeing some flow of retail revenues. It's just the beginning of that process, but we're already somewhat ahead of where we thought we'd be at this point. So all in all, we're feeling very, very strong about the ability to advance the Financial Wellness proposition and to differentiate ourselves in the market based on that proposition. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Erik Bass : Can you provide some more detail on your variable annuity hedging performance this quarter and, in particular, in December? Kenneth Tanji : Yes. Erik, it's Ken. We were quite happy with our hedging programs, particularly in overall. They performed very well. Our variable annuity living benefit hedge program gained $3 billion in value during the quarter, most of that in December, with a hedge effectiveness of 98%. And we also have a capital hedge program that was also very effective at offsetting the overall increase in our net GAAP liabilities due to equity markets. And that's reported in our nonoperating earnings, and that gained over $600 million in value and more than offset the overall increase in our net GAAP liabilities due to equity markets. So we thought our hedge programs did a solid job at protecting our balance sheet and capital position, and we think it demonstrates the resilience of our financial profile amidst difficult markets. Erik Bass : And you've highlighted the consistent cash flows from your annuity business, which, I think, for the year, were above 60% of operating earnings. As your sales growth picks up there, will that cash flow ratio come down? Or is the bigger impact the runoff of the older block of policies that you're seeing? Kenneth Tanji : Yes. So our capital position in annuities is very solid. We've designed our hedging program and our capital framework to withstand market moves. And as I mentioned, the hedging program performed quite well. We hold capital in excess of our own standard and regulatory standards, and that enables cash flow to continue. You cited 60%. That would, I think, be more on a pretax basis. We think of it more on an after-tax basis, and it would be more like 80%, and it was $1.2 billion for the year. That's reflective of the solid fee stream that we have coming from that business that is both well hedged and well capitalized and profitable, and we find that attractive. If we are able to pick up sales in more profitable business and earn the returns that we've -- that we target, that we would think that would be a good use of capital, and we would deploy capital towards that. Operator : And now for closing remarks, I'll turn it back over to Charlie Lowrey. Please go ahead. Charles Lowrey : Thank you. Let me add just a few final thoughts. We feel really positive about how we can continue to make a meaningful difference in our customers' financial lives and deliver long-term value. By leveraging our capabilities across businesses, deploying technology and continuing to innovate, we can grow and expand our market, meaning that there are a variety of ways in which we can reach more customers and do more to help them achieve financial security and peace of mind. We have the scale to invest for the long term and a rock-solid balance sheet to provide our customers with comfort and knowledge of and confidence in our stability throughout the market cycles. With thoughtful strategies and high-quality execution by our talented employees, we deliver sustainable value for our customers, for the communities in which we operate and for our stakeholders. Thank you for your interest in Prudential and for joining the call today. Have a good day. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to the Head of Investor Relations, Darin Arita. Please go ahead, sir. Darin Arita : Thank you, Brad. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today's call are Charlie Lowrey, Chairman and CEO; Rob Falzon, Vice Chairman; Steve Pelletier, Head of Domestic Businesses; Scott Sleyster, Head of International Businesses; Ken Tanji, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared remarks by Charlie, Rob and Ken, and then we will take your questions. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of such measures to comparable non-GAAP \u2013 comparable GAAP measures and the discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, please see the slide titled Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures in the appendix to today's presentation, which can be found on our website at investor.prudential.com. Also, as a reminder, we will be hosting an Investor Day here in Newark, New Jersey, starting at mid-day on June 5. The focus will be on our business strategy, with plenty of time to interact with our executives. We will also feature a Financial Wellness experience exhibit at the start of the events. We hope that you will be able to join us. With that, I will hand it over to Charlie. Charlie Lowrey : Thank you, Darin. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. The first quarter of 2019 marked a solid start to the year for Prudential. We accelerated our strategy to bring greater financial opportunity to more customers. We produced a 12.6% adjusted operating return on equity, increased our book value per share and generated good business fundamentals. With a foundation of a rock-solid balance sheet, we continued to return capital to shareholders totaling $915 million this quarter via share repurchases and dividends. Our three interconnected businesses are the drivers of our financial results. They are the U.S. Financial Wellness business : PGIM, our global asset manager; and International, which has our life insurance business in Japan and smaller businesses in growth markets around the world. In our U.S. Financial Wellness businesses, we continue to grow our suite of solutions to help the employees of our workforce \u2013 of our workplace clients learn, adopt and practice positive financial behaviors. Rob will provide more color on these solutions in a moment. Our workplace clients employ millions of people, giving us a distinct advantage in our ability to connect with a large population via a trusted environment. These workers can engage with us how, when and where they prefer in an in-person, phone or digital way. We see a significant opportunity to expand our total addressable market and to grow as we holistically serve people's needs including investment, retirement income, protection as well as savings and debt management. PGIM is a top 10 global asset manager, with leading positions in alternatives including real estate and private credit. The business continues to generate consistently strong investment performance, third-party flows and core earnings growth. PGIM provides a competitive advantage for our other businesses by helping to innovate new solutions and by generating differentiated investment returns. PGIM in turn benefits from Prudential's significant pool of assets and large balance sheet. Finally, our international operations further distinguish our business model from that of our peers as they provide sustained growth, strong returns, and steady capital generation. We continue to grow our Japan business, maintaining a leadership position in the Japan life insurance market and also have businesses in highly populated growth markets, including Brazil, Chile, Indonesia, India, China and Africa. Turning to slide 3. I'll provide four additional financial highlights on the first quarter. First, first quarter adjusted operating earnings declined from the year ago period primarily due to two factors, one, higher cost for compensation plans tied to Prudential's stock and overall equity market returns; and two, lower fee income reflecting lower average variable annuity assets under management. These two items are partially offset by continued underlining growth across a number of our businesses. Second, our adjusted book value per share grew to more than $96. Third, we deployed our capital into growth \u2013 into growing the business, repurchasing shares and paying dividends. And fourth, we achieved all of this while maintaining a robust capital position consistent with our AA standard. We also saw solid drivers across many of the businesses. Our Retirement business account values increased to a record level. Individual Annuities sales continue to increase and the business maintained its regular quarterly capital generation with $285 million paid to the holding company, and our Life Planner business also delivered a strong sales quarter driven by a record level of life planners. While we are encouraged by the momentum of our businesses, it is important to highlight that we remain disciplined on pricing to ensure that we continue to generate returns at or above our target levels given the recent decline in long-term interest rates, which has had an effect on the level of sales in some of our businesses. Before I turn it over to Rob for more on how our businesses are executing on our strategic priorities, I'd like to say a few words about our commitment to solving the financial challenges of our changing world. So let's turn to slide 4. Underlying our purpose is a commitment to fostering sustainable business that produces attractive returns for our long-term shareholders, along with an integrated environmental, social and governance framework. We've been recognized by a number of third parties specializing in ESG with high marks from Sustainalytics, institutional shareholder services, MSCI and CDP. As an example of our actions, just last month, we announced a $180 million investment in Opportunity Youth. This funds partnerships, grants, corporate contributions and impact investments through 2025 to improve the financial security of young people around the world. We care about ensuring that future generations are prepared for a successful professional and financial life and we are proud of our commitment to their success. This is a great example of who we are as a company and the purpose for which we exist. Thank you all for your time this morning, and with that, I'll turn it over to Rob. Rob Falzon : Thanks, Charlie. I'll provide more color on how we are growing our three businesses : U.S. Financial Wellness, PGIM and International. As shown on slide 5, U.S. Financial Wellness represents our workplace and individual solutions businesses that produce a diversified source for earnings from fees, investment spread and underwriting income. Our broad capabilities including advice, investment, retirement income and protection solutions continue to help clients with their financial wellness needs. We have three key growth priorities for financial wellness. First, we are continuing to help employers understand our differentiated value proposition. Since the launch of our Financial Wellness capabilities in 2015, we have generated about $11 billion of full service retirement plan sales and over $130 million in Group Insurance case wins that we contribute to the competitiveness of our platform. In addition to helping us win new clients, we expect to retain more of our existing clients that are aligned with our value proposition. Second, we are engaging and educating workers to better understand and utilize their existing workplace solutions. We activate these relationships through our financial pathways program and our digital Financial Wellness platform. Our financial pathways program has been adopted by nearly 600 of our workplace clients. In this program, employees of our workplace clients participate in worksite financial seminars delivered by Prudential's financial advisers. Our digital Financial Wellness platform has been adopted by nearly 3,100 clients, reaching nearly 8 million employees. This platform provides a digital venue to address a variety of individuals' needs including education on financial wellness topics, assessment of financial needs and tools that allow individuals to take action. And third, we are addressing the holistic financial needs of individuals. One way we deliver that is via LINK by Prudential which we launched in the second half of 2018. This is a highly personalized online experience that helps employees customize financial goals, connect with advisers digitally or via phone and obtain investment, income and protection solutions. We recently released LINK to our workplace clients and are already beginning to experience good traction on engagement at the individual level. What we do is making a tangible difference. Based on case studies we have conducted, employers are experiencing a significant increase in the productivity and satisfaction of their employees. This includes substantial increases in retirement plan participation, employees increasing their retirement plan contributions to their company's match level or above, and more appropriate asset allocation by utilizing tools that help participants decide on a mix of investment options that meet their particular needs. Ultimately, we believe our solutions can change the behaviors for workers, produce better results for employers and significantly expand our addressable market, thereby enhancing our long-term growth potential. Turning to slide 6. We recently rolled out additional solutions for our workplace clients. As I previously mentioned, we extended the reach of LINK by Prudential to our workplace clients. In addition, we are piloting a financial coaching service available via phone and one-way screen share designed to help individuals learn about and adopt healthier financial behaviors. And we've deployed student loan assistance capabilities including helping individuals, evaluate student loan consolidation or repayment options to more than 350 employers during the first quarter of this year. Also employers can activate a feature that allows them to pay down the student loan debt of their employees. For individuals going through a job transition, we introduced PruPassages, which helps people maintain Financial Wellness and make more informed decisions to navigate changes during this time. And for those who have just lost a loved one, we're providing new beneficiary services, an easier claims process and resources to help guide their decisions during an emotionally challenging period. All these enhancements are aimed at meeting individual's needs at critical moments in their lives while improving productivity for employers and generating positive financial outcomes for our business. Turning to slide 7. PGIM, our global asset management business has over $1.2 trillion of assets under management. In the current quarter, we generated $1.4 billion of positive net third-party flows including $1 billion of institutional and about $400 million of retail net flows. These positive net flows include solid fixed income flows and are driven by our strong long-term investment performance. I would specifically highlight our five-year performance and note that 92% of the assets under management have outperformed their benchmarks over that period. Our strong investment performance and diversified product offering has allowed us to attract flows into high-return strategies such as emerging markets and alternatives. By way of example, we are the third largest global investor in alternative investments with our significant real estate and private credit platforms. This has contributed to keeping our overall asset management field stable at 22 basis points. We are encouraged by our pipeline and our ability to continue to grow. Our distinctive multi-manager model with broad asset class capabilities helps us to expand including globally with roughly 30% of assets under management currently sourced from outside the U.S. Now turning to slide 8. Our International business includes our world-class Japanese life insurance operation as well as other businesses including those in high-growth markets with attractive demographics. Our differentiated business models and proven ability to execute our strategy, combined with seasonally higher earnings from annual premiums, led to a record level of earnings in the quarter. Life Planner sales, which were about half of the total international sales in the current quarter, increased by 19% compared to the year ago quarter. This was driven by higher U.S. dollar sales and the number of Life Planners in Japan increasing by 6% to a record level of more than 4,300. Sales for Gibraltar, which represents the other half of international, were lower than a year ago. This primarily reflects continued competitive conditions in the bank channel. In summary, our momentum remains positive across our businesses : U.S. Financial Wellness, PGIM and International. We have thoughtful strategies and quality execution that continue to build strong fundamentals as we serve our customers well, and we are monetizing those fundamentals to generate profitable growth at attractive returns. With that, I'll hand it over to Ken. Ken Tanji : Thanks, Rob. Slide 9 includes the notable items which had an impact on adjusted operating results in the current quarter. We highlight these items because they may not be indicative of future performance. In total, these 3 items reduced pretax earnings by $10 million or $0.02 per share. Excluding the notable items, earnings per share would be $3.02, relatively consistent with the year ago quarter. First, variable investment income, which includes non-coupon and prepayment income was about $100 million below long-term expectations. This reflects the 1 quarter lag effect of private equity returns and lower-than-expected prepayment fee income partially offset by higher-than-expected hedge fund returns. Second, equity market appreciation in the current quarter resulted in a $70 million of favorable adjustment to certain -- to the recognition of certain benefits and costs primarily associated with variable annuities and variable life policies. And third, underwriting experience was inline with our seasonal expectations and reflects the benefit of our complementary mortality and longevity profile as highlighted on Page 22 in the appendix. Regarding our quarterly earnings pattern, I would also like to highlight a couple of additional items also included in the appendix that impacted current quarter results. Long-term compensation expense for retiree eligible employees is recognized when awards are granted, which is primarily in the first quarter of each year. This resulted in about $30 million of expense in corporate and other and $30 million -- $35 million of expense in PGIM. In addition, certain deferred compensation and long-term employee compensation plans are based on Prudential's stock and equity market performance. Market appreciation in the current quarter exceeded our expectations and resulted in an incremental expense of $50 million primarily in corporate and other. In total, these 2 items reduced pretax earnings by $120 million or $0.22 per share. I would also like to highlight a concentration of annual premiums in our International Insurance operation results in an earnings pattern that favors the first quarter. We estimate that this benefited the current quarter results by about $55 million. Turning to slide 10. I'll provide an update on capital deployment, liquidity and leverage. We returned $915 million to shareholders during the current quarter through dividends and share repurchases. We repurchased $500 million of shares through our $2 billion share repurchase authorization for 2019. In addition, we increased our quarterly common stock dividend per share by 11%. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company amounted to $5.5 billion at the end of the quarter, consistent with year-end 2018 and higher than our $3 billion to $5 billion liquidity target range. We also maintained a strong balance sheet. Our regulatory capital ratios continue to be above our AA financial strength targeted levels and our financial leverage ratio remains better than our target. Turning to slide 11 and in summary, our market-leading global businesses with complementary capabilities are providing integrated financial wellness solutions to more customers. We generated a strong adjusted operating return on equity along with a record adjusted book value per share and continued underlying growth across a number of our businesses, and we distributed $915 million to shareholders and maintained a robust capital and liquidity position with financial flexibility. Now I'll turn it to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Erik Bass : I was hoping you could comment on the pension risk transfer pipeline given the strong momentum you've seen to start the year. And is this pulling forward activity, or do you expect it to remain very active here? Steve Pelletier : Erik, it's Steve. I'll address your question. We look at the pension risk transfer pipeline for the -- for this year as still quite solid. The decline in interest rates has impacted funding levels in plans on an aggregate basis. However, we still see the need for the solution as being quite strong and we still see a very solid opportunity set before us in regard to companies that have already taken steps to hedge or mitigate their exposure to capital markets movements. So we still see a pretty solid pipeline. This is on the U.S. funded side that I'm speaking about, and we feel very good about our opportunities to compete with the net opportunity set. On the unfunded side, the longevity reinsurance side, the U.K. business, we actually see a very strong pipeline. We reported in the aggregate $1.1 billion in PRT flows this quarter. That was $400 million in funded business and $700 million in longevity reinsurance. Also, since the beginning of the second quarter, we publicly announced another couple of billion dollars in longevity reinsurance, and we expect the demand to stay pretty strong on that front for the balance of the year as companies look to manage their risk in this area ahead of Brexit considerations. Erik Bass : Thank you. And then can you talk about the returns you're able to generate on new PRT business? I think historically, you talked about it being in line or higher than the corporate objective of 12% to 13%. Is that still the case? Steve Pelletier : Yes. That would still be the case, Erik. For quite some time, we've been able to write this business at a return level that is consistent with our corporate objectives, actually in the low-double-digits on an unlevered basis, so quite consistent with our corporate objectives. There are certain instances in which we might choose due to the risk characteristics of a certain piece of business to make that into the very high-single-digits. But by-and-large, we do this business at our target levels that are quite consistent with our corporate return objectives. Erik Bass : Great, thank you. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jimmy Bhullar : I had a couple of questions. First, could you just give us some color on what's going on in the Japanese business in terms of competitive conditions, and just your expectations for sales? Obviously, you had a pretty good quarter on the Life Planners side, but a very weak result at Gibraltar. Scott Sleyster : Thanks Jimmy. This is Scott. I think I'll answer that in two ways. For the traditional Life Planner business, we feel like our model is fairly differentiated. It's well trained Life Planners. It's a needs based selling model, and the benefit you're seeing now is that our Life Planner account in Japan is continuing to increase. I think we were up over 250 Life Planners in Japan or 6% this year. So I think that's fairly straightforward, if you will. If you look over at the Gibraltar businesses, you do end up with a different set of activity there, and that we are in the bank market there, and that market is a little more -- it's a little more opportunistic. First of all, the competitors there have different drivers than we do in some cases, and we also compete against the mutual fund market and other things that customers might be looking to do on the margin. For the most part, our business there, we're very focused on recurring premium. You may recall from our Japan Investor Day that what we like to do is take former Life Planners that are well schooled in needs-based planning and move them into the bank channel. And therefore, their focus I think is substantially different than the average player in the market. Market has been pretty competitive. You've seen a decline year-over-year, although not so much quarter-to-quarter, and that will just vary. And if we're going to maintain our pricing discipline, it's really a little bit hard to forecast from that perspective. But I would say there's a stable core of what we do that customers need in the banks, and we're going to stick to our knitting there. Jimmy Bhullar : And for Ken, how much insight do you have on just the book value impact over earnings, increase in earnings volatility you might experience from just changes in accounting for long duration product? Ken Tanji : Yeah. So Jimmy, this is Ken. We're in the early days of adopting those new accounting methods, and it's too early to provide any guidance. Overall, we're working our way through it, and our objective is to, in the end, be able to provide clear measures of our fundamental business performance that's in line with the economics that are appropriate for our business mix. So, it's still very early days, too early for us to comment on directional impact. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. And then just lastly, on the $55 million tailwind to 1Q earnings that you don't expect to repeat in 2Q, that's an after-tax number? Ken Tanji : No. It's a pre-tax. Jimmy Bhullar : Pre-tax number, so it's going to like $0.08, $0.09 to EPS, right? Ken Tanji : I think that's about right, yes. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore. Please go ahead. Tom Gallagher : Hi. So, it looks like your Holdco debt went up by about $1 billion versus 4Q, but Holdco cash stayed flat. Can you comment on what's happening there? Was that just timing of dividends out of the subs, or are you planning on using leverage to fund part of your buybacks and dividends this year? That's my first question. Ken Tanji : Yeah. So overall, we feel very good about our position in terms of capital and highly liquid assets at the holding company. The liquid assets were flat from year-end. We did issue $1 billion of debt, and that is really to position us well for a pre-funding of debt that matures in the second quarter. We did have cash flow come into the holding company from our businesses that pay dividends quarterly and regularly, and that was from annuities and PGIM, which are nice, stable fee businesses that we have on -- providing dividends on a quarterly and regular basis. And then we tend to have the dividends from our insurance operations in the second half of the year. So our businesses are generating solid cash flow, and support -- will support our plans for shareholder distributions as we go through the year. Tom Gallagher : So Ken, I guess, yes. So bottom line there, you expect to fund your dividends and buybacks with all dividends from subs throughout the course of the year, not to re-leverage? Is that a fair conclusion? Ken Tanji : That's right. And over time actually, you've seen our leverage trending down, and that's reflective of the strong cash flow nature of our business. Tom Gallagher : Got you. And then just my follow-up is just on PGIM. Now I know you don't disclose it this way on asset flows, but from the ending balances between equity and fixed income, it looks like you're seeing pretty big inflows in the fixed income and outflows in equities. Just want to know is that what's happening underneath? And also, with that -- are there implications for revenue yields that you see there because PGIM revenue yields have held up quite well, so just curious if you would expect that to remain the case. Steve Pelletier : Tom, it's Steve. I'll address your question. Thanks for it. You're right in making the observation that, by and large, we've seen flows into fixed income and outflows on the equity side. That's been the case for the past about several quarters, largely in the face of the active to passive trend, especially in equities. Although generally speaking, we've seen that -- we've seen the pressure on our equity flows moderate in the course of 2018, say. Our equity performance as well as our fixed income performance remains very strong. We see a good pipeline of mandates. So, based on the observation that at the end of the day investment performance really is the beginning of the virtuous cycle in the asset management business. We remain very confident in our ability to continue to generate flows in certainly fixed income and equities as well. In regard to revenue yield, I would say that our flows into fixed income have been into, relatively speaking, higher fee-yielding strategies. That's been especially true over the past, say, year and a half to two years. And so we have been able -- even in the face of some equity outflows and strong fixed income inflows, we've been able to maintain that 22 basis point fee level for some period now. That remains quite stable and we expect it to be so. I'd also just make the final observation that while all of our businesses are at scale with PGIM, the scale characteristics of our fixed income business are especially strong. So, when we attract flows into that business, it bodes well for our operating margin in the business. Tom Gallagher : Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. Operator : And we now have a question from the line of Suneet Kamath with Citi. Please go ahead. Suneet Kamath : Thanks. Just wanted to start with the wellness initiative. Can you give us a sense of how much you're spending on that on an annual basis? And what kind of the spend has been maybe over the past couple of years and where it's showing up? Steve Pelletier : Suneet, I would address it. We've spoken before about our initiative spendings overall as a company. The Financial Wellness spend is a meaningful portion of that, but we have not broken that out as a separate matter. I would say that a fair amount of the spend is visible in our retirement and group businesses kind of concentrating on the top of the client engagement funnel, if you will. That's where people come into the Financial Wellness experience, through group and retirement. So, when you see some pick up in expenses -- in G&A expenses in those businesses, a significant portion of that is due to the Financial Wellness effort. In regard to the returns, we're realizing on it. We're actually very pleased in the areas that Rob outlined in his opening comments. We definitely see that momentum on the top -- at the top of the funnel. The very strong momentum in our full-service sales and in our group sales over the past couple of years is directly attributable to the Financial Wellness effort and Rob highlighted those numbers in his comments. And we see very strong beginnings of engagement of individuals with the Financial Wellness experience. Lots of different numbers I could cite from Rob's presentation, but in particular, I'd speak to the 8 million people who are now accessible -- who can now access the digital Financial Wellness portal through the 3,100 employers that have activated that portal. And we see the beginnings of very solid engagement, engagement with the digital properties that are in the portal, with the digital properties that are being introduced across the Financial Wellness platform, in particular LINK and some of the other capabilities that Rob mentioned. We see very solid engagement with those capabilities. We see people completing the kind of learning experiences and needs-based analysis that is embedded in that experience. And over time, we like the prospects for this resulting in individuals who come to us via the Financial Wellness portal engagement with our solutions, with our individual solutions as well, investment solutions, retirement solutions, and insurance solutions. I will emphasize that those individual-based revenues will emerge over an extended period of time, but all of the metrics that we're tracking and we'll talk more about this on Investor Day in June, all of the metrics we're tracking lead us to feel that this initiative is well on track in terms of achieving those outcomes for individuals and their employers. Ken Tanji : And I'll just add. This is Ken. Overall, we've been very disciplined and consistent in our approach to managing our operating expense resources and that reflects a combination of taking actions to gain significant efficiencies across the company by creating centers of excellence, pulling together functions to gain efficiency, and improving quality and improving systems and implementing automation. And those savings and efficiencies allowed us to, at the same time, increase resources to the initiatives that Steve just described to you in building data, digital customer service and customer engagement capabilities and expanding our PGIM business globally. So, if you looked across the surface at our operating expense, you'd see a pretty stable outlook modestly growing and growing at a rate below our earnings growth and expanding margins but, at the same time, being able to invest into the capabilities that Steve described. Suneet Kamath : Okay. Thank you. And then on the compensation plan, I guess that hit in the first quarter for the retirement eligible employees. Can you give us any kind of sensitivity around -- either sensitivity of the markets or your stock price just to help us model this? It seems like that was a decent portion of the shortfall relative to consensus? Ken Tanji : Yes. There was really kind of two pieces to that and I think it's important to distinguish between them. The retiree-eligible piece means that if you're a retiree-eligible, the accounting requires that we expense that when it's granted even though it is paid out over a -- typically over a three-year period. And that was $70 million; $35 million in PGIM, $35 million in Corporate, but that's not market-sensitive. That's going to occur in the first quarter when their grants are typically made, and that occurred this quarter and it occurred in prior quarters as well. So it's more of a seasonal timing of expense than market-related. On the market-related piece which was $50 million and primarily in Corporate, you can think of that as having our compensation plans tied to the performance either of our stock and aligned -- aligning management's interest in that. Or to the extent people defer compensation and linking it to market indexes, it would experience fluctuation with those markets. In the first quarter, that was $50 million and our stock price improved by 13% and the S&P improved by 13%. So you can sort of calibrate $50 million to a 13% change in both of those components. Suneet Kamath : And will that happen every quarter? Meaning that, that second one, the $50 million, is that adjusted on a quarterly basis? Ken Tanji : Yes. It will as market moves. And if you look to the fourth quarter, you saw it in the opposite direction actually to a more sizable degree. Suneet Kamath : Got it. Okay. Thanks. Rob Falzon : Suneet, it's Rob. The only thing I'd add is that, that is factored into the sensitivities that we've given you for full year earnings for the -- plus or minus 10% in equities. We talk about that being $0.30. That $0.30 is net of this. It's just the timing of it is such that we give you a full year number on sensitivity but the compensation piece hits in the current quarter, whereas the benefit is sort of spread throughout. Suneet Kamath : Okay. Thanks. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of John Nadel with UBS. Please go ahead. John Nadel : So Rob, I appreciate your comment there at the end in response to Suneet's question. It's a good segue to where I wanted to go. It seems to me at a high level that the strong market performance in the first quarter, actually on an aggregate basis for your company's earnings had a negative impact given we get the point-to-point impact through these compensation arrangements. But the average market performance impact was not that significant and we are to be getting that on more of a lagged basis as we work through the rest of the year. So I guess, just to confirm your comment, 10 or 10%-plus, I mean the market's up almost 17% at this point year-to-date performance. We ought to be seeing the first quarter pressures more than overcome by business segment earnings results, right? Ken Tanji : Yes. This is Ken. That's exactly the way to think about it. It's the timing. So the $0.30 that we provided for a increase of 10% in the markets, that was over one year. And you saw the first component of that being the impact on costs of $50 million of the deferred and long-term comp expense hitting this quarter, and then in subsequent quarters, you would see the benefit which would be more than the $0.30 over one year's period. That make sense? John Nadel : It does make sense to me, I guess. I guess when I think about the -- one of the slides in your deck shows a seasonal pattern and I know this isn't necessarily seasonal, but you highlight that -- and this has been the case forever, that your international operations benefit seasonally in the first quarter and then to some degree relative to the rest of the year. But you're not really highlighting for us the negative impact of this particular comp item relative to the positive impact that you ought to see in the rest of your businesses for the remainder of the year. And I guess I'd advise you guys if I could be so bold as to try to lay that out for us, even it's not on this call at your Investor Day coming up because you've missed earnings now, right, for four straight quarters. It's despite what's been a pretty good -- other than 4Q, a very good market backdrop, and I think there's some significant disconnect. I hear some really good commentary about growth around Financial Wellness, et cetera, et cetera. It seems to me there is more upfront cost and more lagged revenue effect. Maybe you could help flush that out as well. I just see you guys just performing so well from a strategic perspective and there's some miss between the connection of earnings to consensus expectations. That's all. Ken Tanji : Yes. There's a timing consideration. We do think it's important to align management's interest with the performance of the stock and that -- the accounting for that is appropriately recognized immediately and then the fees will occur over time. So over time, we think obviously, the equity markets are a very positive thing for our underlying earnings power and you should expect to see that in the subsequent quarters. Charles Lowrey : Hey, John, it's Charlie. First of all, let me say thank you for your comment. No, we really appreciate it. And to be candid, it's a source for frustration for us as well. We think our businesses are performing well. We are very pleased with the businesses we're in. We think they're high quality, they're at scale. The Financial Wellness initiative is bringing them all together in an integrated way. And this is -- we've been on a long journey and we're proud of where we come from in terms of the divesting of non-strategic businesses, acquiring businesses that we want to be in. And so we are also, quite frankly, frustrated by the noise that's out there that is created by some of the accounting regulation and other things. And so we will work on that and we'll try and see as we have and Rob and his crew over the years have tried to simplify our earnings. And you've seen us to be able to simplify them and bring net income more in line with AOI over time, but we have more work to do and we will commit to working on that to try and clarify and simplify our results to reflect what we think is a really good business system that we have and a good strategy. John Nadel : I appreciate that, Charlie. Thanks very much. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead. Ryan Krueger : Thanks, good morning. I had a question on holding company, liquidity above your targets. I think your buyback and dividends are relatively equal to your free cash flow generation. Just curious, how you're thinking about utilizing excess capital that's above your targets over time and if it's more dependent on opportunistic situations or if you look to manage that down? Ken Tanji : Well, yeah, again, we feel really good about our capital position and our cash flow. It's been a pretty consistent picture of us generating good cash flow from our businesses, using that in a combination of ways. One, first, is to grow our businesses in attractive opportunities such as pension risk transfer. We have also had the opportunity to reduce leverage, and that also provides a source of financial flexibility for us. So overall, we feel real good about our capital position. It's been very consistent. We've been increasing our shareholder distributions in line with our earnings and as we generate cash flow. And we -- I think you should expect that to continue. Ryan Krueger : Okay, thanks. And can you give any perspective on how you're feeling about interest rate assumptions and policyholder behavioral trends and variable annuity, and the variable annuity business heading into the actuarial assumption review? Ken Tanji : Yeah. We're still going through that. As you know, we do that in the second quarter. We're still doing our work, and we don't -- we prefer not to preview that on this call. Ryan Krueger : Okay, understood. Thank you. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead. Humphrey Lee : Hi, thank you for taking my questions. My first question is related to prepayment income. Obviously, you've lowered this in a quarter, and I think some of your peers talked about having lower prepayment income as well, which is surprising given yield came down in the quarter and spread tightened. I was just wondering, do you see that as a timing issue, or is there any structural change to the debt issuance market as refinancing activity slow down? Ken Tanji : No. I think it's just -- the way to think about it is typical volatility, less tied to rate environments and more tied around the financing needs of the borrowers, and that's typically tied to some transactions or strategies that are underlying their businesses. So the change has been very typical, and if you looked at that -- as we look at that over time, it tends to be above and below our expectations on a fairly consistent basis, and so we see what happened this quarter is just typical. Humphrey Lee : Got it. And then shifting gear to PGIM. Just looking at the gross sales, especially on the institutional side came down by a fair amount. I was just wondering, if you can talk a little bit about what you're seeing recently and then also in terms of your pipeline, in terms of on a gross sales perspective? Steve Pelletier : Humphrey, it's Steve. I\u2019ll address your question and in doing so, I'll echo some of the comments I made earlier. We do see some solid pipeline in front of us across multiple asset classes, in particular in fixed income but also in equities as well. And with the performance -- investment performance that we're generating, with the build-out that we made in our global distribution platforms and with some of the mandates that we've -- that we're already seeing, some of which have yet to fund, but they've already been awarded. We do continue to feel very confident that our long, long string of positive net flows from the institutional market has every prospect for continuing. Humphrey Lee : So the low gross sales is just more of a timing issue as opposed to a change in client demand? Steve Pelletier : Correct. Humphrey Lee : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of John Barnidge with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. John Barnidge : Thanks. Both VA and FA sales did well. How much of this momentum have you seen carry over into 2Q? And then how much of this growth, do you think is coming from just the industry being hot versus Financial Wellness program driven demand? Steve Pelletier : John, it's Steve. I'll address your question. We think that the sales that we saw in the first quarter really reflect the strong momentum that we have in the business. It's across multiple products and we see very strong diversification and growing diversification of our business with our Prudential defined income product having a major contribution and building momentum in our fixed index annuity. And that, in particular, was a product, which basically got off the ground a year ago when we saw $200 million in sales in it this quarter. We see this strength across multiple distribution channels within the industry, and we think we have every prospect of continuing the momentum. In saying that, we always run all of our businesses for sustainable profitable growth, and we will continue to manage them accordingly and to take a look at our pricing dynamics in relation to the market environment in which we're operating. But I think what we're really seeing is growing demand among financial advisers for their clients to be able to access this type of solution. There has been a pickup in industry sales, but I will say that we're pleased to see that both in 2018 and in the first quarter of 2019 our growth has been above industry levels. So we've been gaining share in this market. John Barnidge : Okay. And my follow-up, with this being the first tax season since reform was finalized, have you noticed any changes in behavior on the part of the consumer, business owners? And this may also be more relevant for 2Q than 1Q? Thanks for the answers. Stephen Pelletier : I've not seen any particular dynamics from the -- any behaviors in regard to tax season, that would be unusual compared to previous years. Operator : And we do have a question from the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Scott : Hi. Good morning. First question I had was just on dividend capacity. I think you commented some on it already, but I guess just in light of sort of the mix of dividends this last year and it kind of being, I think, a bit more weighted towards international versus your biggest U.S. opco, could you talk about how dividend capacity looks this year? When you do expect to have access to dividends? Ken Tanji : Yes. This is Ken. Last year, I'll remind you that we did have the impact of tax reform and that led to a strengthening of our capital position in Prudential Insurance Company of America, our flagship U.S. insurance company. And so we didn't take a dividend from that business last year, but we would expect to this year in ordinary course, as well as having the diversity of our cash flows from our other businesses with PGIM generating cash flow, quarterly annuities generating cash flow quarterly and our international businesses, particularly in Japan, also with a source of cash flow at the typical levels, which will vary over time and certainly quarter-to-quarter, but it's about 65% of after-tax earnings. Alex Scott : Got it. Okay. And my follow-up question was just on PGIM. When I look at earnings and maybe a margin, sort of, adjusted for the other related revenues and earnings that you receive there, I mean the core margins and I appreciate that there was, sort of, these first quarter seasonal deferred comp expense, but even just looking relative to other 1Qs. I mean the margin I think was down around 4 or 5 points from where it's been. So I would just be interested if there was anything else that's already going on there. I mean, should we expect margins to sort of remain at this lower level, or do we -- or should we expect them to go back up to a higher level? And if you could remind us, I think you guys have talked about a core margin target there before that maybe was closer to the 30%? Stephen Pelletier : Alex, it's Steve. I'll address your question. We do not -- the numbers that we look at, we're not seeing the same type of margin erosion to which you refer. Maybe we can follow-up in due course. But we do see that, as we attract flows into businesses at scale and maintain our average fee rate, which we've been quite successful in doing, we see the ability to continue to gradually and all of the things being equal, expand our margins in the business. In the range of the 30%-plus is how we see our margin objectives in the business. We can talk more about this again at Investor Day, but we do see the opportunity and the reality of continued margin expansion in the business. Alex Scott : Thank you. Operator : And at this time, for closing remarks, I'll turn the conference back over to Charlie Lowrey. Please go ahead, sir. Charlie Lowrey : Sure. Thank you. Let me close with a few final thoughts. We feel confident about our strategy, the scale of our businesses and the strength of our balance sheet. As we continue to focus on our businesses and deploy new technology to grow and expand our markets, we will make an even greater impact on the financial lives of our customers and in the global community. This should lead to growth in our businesses and greater value for our shareholders. We look forward to providing you with more details at our Investor Day here in Newark on June 5. Thank you for joining the call, and have a nice day. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using the AT&T Executive Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Darin Arita. Please go ahead. Darin Arita : Thank you, Cynthia. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today\u2019s call are Charlie Lowrey, Chairman and CEO; Rob Falzon, Vice Chairman; Steve Pelletier, Head of Domestic Businesses; Scott Sleyster, Head of International Businesses; Ken Tanji, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared remarks by Charlie, Rob and Ken, and then we will take your questions. Today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of such measures to the comparable GAAP measures and the discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, please see the slide titled Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures in the appendix to today\u2019s presentation, which can be found on our website at investor.prudential.com. Also, in response to your request, we are changing the timing of our earnings release date starting next quarter. We will report our third quarter results on Monday, November 4, and host the conference call on Tuesday, November 5 at 11 :00 AM. With that, I will hand it over to Charlie. Charlie Lowrey : Thank you, Darin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As we outlined in our Investor Day in early June, we are accelerating our strategy to bring greater financial opportunity to more customers and to enhance the value we provide to our investors. Across each of our businesses, we are energized by our purpose of making lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world. As expectations of our customers rapidly evolve, it\u2019s imperative that we\u2019ll move quickly and with urgency to achieve our purpose. Despite what we would characterize as a mixed quarter, we remained confident about the financial goals we shared with you during our Investor Day. At that time, we increased our return on equity goal to a range of 12% to 14% from the prior range of 12% to 13%. We also articulated how we can achieve a high-single digit earnings per share growth rate over the intermediate term with potential for a low-double digit growth rate over the longer term. The strength of our distinct business model and ability to execute our strategy gives us confidence that we will achieve our financial results. Our U.S. Financial Wellness businesses, PGIM and our International business offers unique scale and growth opportunities that cannot be easily replicated. In the near-term however, we expect several factors to impact our level of earnings. First, as we discussed on Investor Day, there will be implementation costs from accelerating our strategy. Second, the significant decline in long-term interest rates over the past six months obviously affects our spread income and reinvestment rates of our general account. Third, this quarter\u2019s assumption update in Individual Life reduced future earnings. And fourth, we expect lower earnings in Gibraltar. Now we have ways to mitigate some of these effects. We believe the actions to accelerate our strategy will lead to $500 million of margin improvement, which we expect to realize a run rate level of $50 million by the end of this year. In addition, we can adjust our pricing, streamline distribution and optimize our in-force book, all of which we are seriously pursuing. As we said during our last call and on Investor Day, we\u2019re also very focused on connecting our track record of operating fundamentals with commensurate financial outcomes. Quite frankly, part of this is on us to produce better financial results and we get it, but part of this relates to better aligning external expectations with our internal forecasts. And part of this call is focused on trying to do that. As a result, we enhanced our disclosures this quarter to help give you better visibility on our expected results and Ken will cover this in more detail. We also continue to explore ways to reduce the variability of our quarterly earnings, which as you know, has been and remains an ongoing effort. Turning back to the second quarter financial results, we generated return on equity of 12.9%, which is in line with our 12% to 14% goal. We grew up adjusted book value per share by 5% from a year ago to a record level of $97.15. We also maintained a rock solid balance sheet. This provided the foundation for us to return $911 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our quarterly dividend of $1 per share represents a 4% yield on our adjusted book value. Our holding company\u2019s highly liquid assets stood at $4.9 billion at the top end of our target range of $3 billion to $5 billion. Turning to Slide 3, our adjusted earnings per share was $3.14, up from $3.1 a year ago. Our sales in that flows varied by business and were mixed in this quarter, but we continue to see a robust pipeline of opportunities. During the quarter, PGIM had net outflows driven by a large client withdrawal, which was unfortunate, but frankly inevitable from time to time when you were the 10th largest asset manager in the world. Also Gibraltar had lower sales as we focused on recurring premium product and profitability over the total sales amount, which is consistent with the way in which we run this business. On the positive side, our Retirement business achieved record account levels of $478 billion and net flows of $15 billion, driven primarily by a robust pension risk transfer pipeline. And our Individual Annuities and Individual Life sales were up 29% and 27%, respectively. Our Individual Annuities business continue to generate consistent quarterly dividends to the parent company, but more than $1.1 billion produced over the past 12 months. Finally our Life Planner headcount in our International business reached an all-time high. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Rob to touch on strategic highlights from the quarter. Rob Falzon : Thanks, Charlie. I\u2019ll provide more color on how we were growing our three differentiated businesses, U.S. Financial Wellness, PGIM and International. As shown on the Slide 4, U.S. Financial Wellness represents our Workplace and Individual Solutions businesses that produce a diversified source of earnings from fees, investment spread and underwriting income. A broad set of integrated capabilities including advice, retirement, investments and insurance solutions, continue to help people with their Financial Wellness needs. Our Financial Wellness proposition is resonating with Workplace customers, particularly from higher sales. And it is resonating with the employees of those customers, driving higher participation rates in the employer benefit programs and increased engagement with our advice platform. We believe the success has the potential to increase the intermediate term earnings growth rate of our underlying U.S. businesses into the mid- to high-single digits. There are three drivers of this earnings growth and Financial Wellness. First, we expect increased operating margins across our Workplace and Individual Solutions businesses. This will result from the comprehensive at scale solutions that our businesses provide and the investments that we\u2019re making to enable our broad capabilities, while enhancing the customer experience. The current quarter, we incurred about $20 million of implementation costs to support programs that will accelerate our Financial Wellness strategy. We believe these actions along with the other programs over the next three years will lead to $500 million of margin improvement by 2020. Second, we expect increased revenues in our Workplace Solutions businesses due to the competitiveness of our Financial Wellness platform and increased utilization of the existing employer offered benefits by our clients and employees. Since the end of the first quarter of this year, the number of people who have activated our digital Financial Wellness platform has increased from $8.1 million to $8.6 million as of June 30. This platform provides a digital venue to address a variety of needs including education on financial wellness topics, assessment of financial health and tools that enable people to take action and improve their financial outcomes. In addition, our prudential pathways program has been adopted by 650 of our workplace clients. In this program, employees of our workplace customers participate in financial seminars, delivered by Prudential\u2019s financial advisors and designed to help educate people so they can improve their financial outcomes. And third, we expect increased revenues in our individual solutions business, due to our ability to provide additional solutions to the employees of our workplace customers and to other retail customers. One way, we deliver these solutions is to LINK by Prudential, which is our highly interactive personalized online resource, enables people to create a path toward achieving their financial goals. Began to deploy LINK on our workplace platform last quarter, and we have already made it available to roughly 1.3 million people up from 200,000 at the end of March. Our goal is to double this to 2.5 million people by year end. Ultimately, we believe our solutions to change the way people approach their financial health, produce better results for employers and significantly expand our addressable market, thereby enhancing our long-term growth potential. Turning to Slide 5. PGIM, our asset management business has $1.3 trillion of assets under management. It is a top 10 global asset manager, ranking as the fifth largest investor in fixed income and the third largest investor in the alternative investments area, with significant real estate and private platforms. PGIM is the investment engine of Prudential and benefits from a symbiotic relationship with our U.S. Financial Wellness and International Insurance businesses. PGIM\u2019s asset origination capability and investment management expertise provide a competitive advantage to our businesses, helping those businesses to bring enhanced solutions and more value to our customers, both retail and institutional. And our businesses, in churn provide a differentiated source of growth for PGIM through affiliated AUM flows, that complement its successful third-party track record. Consistent with our historical earnings growth, we expect PGIM to generate mid-to-high single digit earnings growth through a market cycle. This is driven by revenue growth from our proven ability to capture industry flows and market share in the areas where we already have leading capabilities while expanding our margins. Our strong investment performance and expertise across our broad range of asset classes has allowed us to attract flows into higher returns \u2013higher return strategies such as emerging markets and alternatives. This focus on higher yielding strategies and asset classes has resulted in our ability to maintain a 22 basis point overall asset management fee yield. 90% or more of the assets under management have outperformed their benchmarks over the last five and 10 year periods. And this investment performance has driven 16 consecutive years of positive third-party institutional debt flows, which we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll continue to despite the $5 billion third-party net outflows that we experienced in the current quarter. These institutional outflows were mainly driven by a single fixed income client withdrawal of $5 billion. We serve many of the world\u2019s largest pension funds and other institutional investors. And as a result, we\u2019ll experience large idiosyncratic inflows and outflows from time-to-time. Our third-party net retail inflows were $1 billion driven by fixed income flows, partially offset by equity outflows. We\u2019re encouraged by our pipeline of mandates in our ability to continue to grow PGIM via the investments we\u2019ve been making to expand our global distribution. The growth opportunities we see in markets such as alternatives, U.S. defined contribution in retail and international and the investments we\u2019re making in technology. Now turning to Slide 6. Our International business includes our world-class Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated business model with unique distribution, as well as other expanding businesses in high growth markets like Brazil. We anticipate being able to grow earnings in our international business at a mid-single-digit rate over the intermediate term driven by sustainable revenue growth and stable margins while continuing to produce ROEs in the mid-teens. Life Planner sales which are about half of the total international sales in the current quarter, increased by 5% compared to the year ago quarter. This was driven by higher U.S. dollar sales in Japan and continued growth in our Brazil operations. Sales for Gibraltar which represents the other half of international were 26% lower than a year ago. This reflects lower single pay U.S. dollar fixed annuity sales in our life consultant channel, as we continue to focus on recurring pay protection products. In addition, the recent decline in U.S. interest rates resulted in lower credit and grades which also affected sales. Additionally, sales were affected by continued to competitive conditions in the bank channel and lower production in our independent agency channel. We expect these channels to be more volatile sources of growth measured in the short-term viewed as competitive market pricing dynamics. We\u2019ll continue to innovate new products and consider pricing actions or focusing on maintaining our target level of profitability to improve sales over time, particularly in our life consultant channel. In summary, our differentiated businesses, awful strategies and quality execution continue to serve our customers well and will generate profitable and attractive returns consistent with the intermediate term expectations that we articulated during our recent Investor Day. And with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Ken. Ken Tanji : Thanks, Rob. I will begin on Slide 7, with some enhanced disclosures that we\u2019ve added this quarter to provide more insights about our earnings for the upcoming third quarter and beyond relative to our current second quarter earnings. First we begin with our second quarter of pretax adjusted operating income, which was $1.7 billion and resulted in earnings per shares of $3.14. Then when we adjust for these items, we get a baseline of $3 per share for the third quarter, before including the impact of future share purchases, business growth and market impacts. Now there are three categories to consider. First, the second quarter included a net unfavorable impact of $49 million from this year\u2019s annual actuarial review, which will not occur in the third quarter. Second, we assume variable investment income. We\u2019ll return to a normalized level, which is worth $90 million. And third, there are other considerations we expect will lower results by 30 million in the third quarter. Gibraltar earnings are expected to be $15 million lower due to lower sales and lower interest rates, and corporate and other is expected to have $15 million of higher expenses. Well, we have provided these items to consider, there may be inevitably be other factors that affect third quarter earnings per share. Also, as Rob mentioned, we incurred about $20 million of an implementation costs to accelerate our financial wellness strategy in the current quarter. We hope this slide provides enhanced visibility for future EPS considerations Also on Slide 18, we have provided information regarding seasonal item by business. One item to note is the end of the Wells Fargo fee arrangement in the first quarter of 2020, which has recently been approximately $15 million per quarter. Turning to Slide 8. I\u2019ll provide an update on capital deployment, liquidity and leverage. We feel very good about the overall strength of our capital position. We returned $911 million to shareholders during the current quarter through dividends and share repurchases. Our share repurchases authorization for the remainder of the year is $1 billion as of June 30, and over the last five years we\u2019ve increased our dividend per share by 16% per year on average. As Charlie noted, our quarterly dividend of $1 represents a 4% yield on our adjusted book value. We also continue to maintain a rock solid balance sheet. Our regulatory capital ratios continue to be above our AA financial strength targets and our financial leverage ratio remains better than our target. We\u2019re also pleased that Moody\u2019s recently acknowledged our financial strength with our credit upgrades. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company was $4.9 billion at the end of the quarter, consistent with the first quarter of 2019, and at the top end of our $3 billion to $5 billion liquidity target range. We look to continue to invest in our businesses to grow assessed acquisition opportunities to build scale or gain capabilities and return capital to shareholders. Turning to Slide 9, and in summary, we are focused on accelerating our strategy and remain confident in our planned initiatives for growth. We have generated an ROE that is within our goal of 12% to 14% along with a record high adjusted book value per share. We continue to generate strong cash flows that support consistent growth in dividends and other distributions to shareholders, and we maintain a robust capital and liquidity position with financial flexibility. Now I\u2019ll turn it back over to the operator for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go to the line of Nigel Dally with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Nigel Dally : Great. Thanks and good morning. So looking at Slide 7, you baseline the earnings at $3, would annualize to $12. That\u2019s a quite significant reduction from the $12.75 midpoint guidance you provided at the outlook call. Now, in your prepared remarks, you highlighted a number of factors behind that, but hoping you can go run through each of those in some more detail. Ken Tanji : Yes, sure. This is Ken. So we don\u2019t want to update guidance, but what I thought I could do is highlight a few items to consider that we\u2019re not in our guidance that we gave last December. Now, first, as we\u2019ve articulated the Financial Wellness implementation costs, we announced that at Investor Day that\u2019s going to trim EPS in the second half of the year. We also updated this quarter, our mortality assumptions in Individual Life and that will have an ongoing impact into the second quarter. And then interest rates that we assumed in our guidance where \u2013 now where we\u2019ll find ourselves, we\u2019re about over 100 basis points below that. Now that is partially offset by equity markets that are higher, but those to net to a negative. So if you added all of those together, that\u2019s worth about $0.50 relative to our guidance for the second half of the year. Nigel Dally : Okay. And just \u2013 also I think, it looked like Gibraltar earnings are going to be somewhat softer than expected. Just the details behind that one too. Ken Tanji : Yes. And that\u2019s also captured in the interest rate comment that I made. Maybe I\u2019ll turn it over to Scott for a little bit more background on that. Scott Sleyster : Yes. So in terms of Gibraltar earnings, we\u2019re impacted by several factors, some of which will persist through year-end. Net of the favorable assumptions in Gibraltar earnings were down about $35 million year-over-year. And the key contributors to this decline were really driven by two factors; underwriting which was still favorable to our pricing assumptions was less favorable than last year, and that represents about a third of that. And then the balance of the decline was largely driven by higher expenses related to certain technology and end of life system spends, process improvements in automation and investments that we\u2019re making to support future growth. At Investor Day, I noted that PII is starting to leverage some of the capabilities that have been deployed in the U.S. as part of the customer office and Financial Wellness initiatives, and additionally given increased scrutiny on suitability and sales compliance. We\u2019re also investing in process and systems that support our distribution including those that ensure appropriate oversight. So we\u2019re accelerating some of these efforts and we expect this level of spend to persist through year-end and into early 2020. I think looking forward to the balance of the year, as Ken noted, the recent decline in rates and lower sales will also weigh on Gibraltar\u2019s year-end results. Meanwhile, the total Japan operations continue to generate strong cash flow to PFI, we distributed $1.1 billion in the second quarter alone. Nigel Dally : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, so you guys updated, expanded your ROE range at your Investor Day, which obviously was pretty close to the end of the quarter, and now you reset your current forward earnings expectations for a couple of your main businesses. And so I guess, does this pushback, in your mind, you\u2019re hitting kind of the topper end, top end of that ROE target that you just relate to The Street? Charlie Lowrey : Yes. So, our ROE objective is 12% to 14%, and that is a range and for the first half of the year we\u2019re at 12.9%. When we sent that objective, we did assume rates at the time would continue to increase consistent with the forward curve. We\u2019ve given sensitivities that show the impact of rates, which is gradual over time. And so as we think about that, if rates were persist, you would see \u2013 that have some impact into our ROE, but our initiatives that we have to expand margins and to accelerate our strategy, we think will keep us within our 12% to 14% ROE objective in the intermediate term. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then in terms of the Financial Wellness plan, you guys \u2013 the initiatives there, you guys called out some expenses in the quarter. When you guys laid that out at the Investor Day, you told us what the expenses were and then also the saves, obviously, takes a little longer for the saves to start rolling into the numbers. Can you just give us a sense of when we should start seeing some of the saves coming to the numbers, and then also in terms of sequentially how much higher those expenses could be as we think about them building up from the second to the third quarter? Rob Falzon : Elyse, it\u2019s Rob. Our view on the initiatives that we\u2019re undertaking with respect to Financial Wellness and both the costs and benefits for that are still consistent with what we outlined on Investor Day. We think through the year we\u2019ll have about $135 million in expenses, $20 million of which you saw in the current quarter. And then we would expect that those expenses will generate about $50 million of run rate earnings by the end of the year. You\u2019ll see those fully in 2020 given that they sort of build into a run rate through the course of the year. The initiatives are all in flight, but are back ended in the context of sort of when we\u2019ll be incurring costs on a quarter to quarter basis, so less than the second quarter, comparable to slightly more kind of a level in the third quarter that\u2019s included in the slide that Ken walked you through in terms of expectations for costs related to corporate and other in the third quarter, and then the net more elevated level in the fourth quarter. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, great. And one last quick question for corporate. In the past, you guys have guided to higher expenses in the fourth quarter. I know Slide 7 was setting the base for the third quarter, but are you still expecting that in this year Q4 corporate expenses would be higher than what we see during \u2013 the average of the first three quarters? Charlie Lowrey : Yes. That\u2019s been the pattern of our expenses and we would expect that to continue this fourth quarter and we\u2019ll give you a little bit more specific guidance around that at the end of the third quarter. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thank you for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Your line is open. Ryan Krueger : Hi, good morning. You mentioned that you still believe you can generate the high-single digit intermediate term EPS growth. Is that \u2013 does that contemplate some of the step down function in the near-term earnings power or is that \u2013 or should we think about that more as the growth rate off of the lower near-term EPS base? Rob Falzon : Ryan, it\u2019s Rob. The change in expectations with regard to this year vis-\u00e0-vis the guides we provided you, it\u2019s not material in the context of what we would expect in terms of that intermediate term growth rate. So I don\u2019t think we would view that as being a material input into our ability to achieve that more elevated level of growth. Ryan Krueger : Okay. And then as you mentioned, potential in-force actions as one of the possible offsets, can you expand some on \u2013 in terms of what you might be contemplating there? Steve Pelletier : Ryan, it\u2019s Steve, I\u2019ll take that part of your question. In Individual Life, we\u2019re looking at three main drivers in an effort to improve returns in that business over the next few years. What you mentioned is one of them, I\u2019d just \u2013 first I\u2019d mentioned though, that we continue to generate strong sales of the business. The new business that we\u2019ve been writing over the last few years, I should point out has been priced using much more current assumptions that are very different from the assumptions used to price the legacy products that have generated some of the recent charges we\u2019ve taken. We remain quite disciplined in our pricing. And our new sales have a very well diversified mix and we think these newer sales will help significantly and profitably growing the business over the next several years. Second part of the plan is exploring different options for optimizing our in-force management as you referenced that largely refers, Ryan, to exploring a wider range of reinsurance options. And third, we continue to be focused on the cost effectiveness of the Individual Life business platform. That certainly includes ongoing and continuing efforts to enhance the cost effectiveness of the businesses operating platform, but we\u2019re also exploring some innovative new ways of delivering our life insurance products to the marketplace in a cost effective way. All of this is intended to improve returns in a business that remains an important part of our overall business mix. It serves an important need in the marketplace and is a critical part of our Financial Wellness value proposition. Ryan Krueger : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore. Your line is open. Tom Gallagher : Good morning. First question I wanted to ask you is on Japan. Can you provide a little perspective on what\u2019s going in that market more broadly? Gibraltar, I know you highlighted the weaker sales levels on the FX products, POJ looks like they held up better. Are you seeing significant increase in competitive pressures from the domestics? And also I think I heard a mention of some regulatory scrutiny, is that on the FX product, and maybe some elaboration there? Thanks. Scott Sleyster : Hi, Tom, this is Scott. Let me start. I think I gave you a pretty good rundown on Gibraltar, let me start with POJ and then come back to your \u2013 more details in your question. So, in the case of POJ, our in-force block continues to grow and the in-force block was actually up almost 5% year-over-year. And additionally, our Life Planner account in Japan was also up about 5%, I think a little more than 5% year-over-year. And you may recall that\u2019s comfortably ahead of the 2% \u2013 2% to 3% Life Planner overall growth that we noted on Investor Day. So I would say the fundamentals of the POJ business remain quite strong and sort of most of the challenges that we\u2019re facing have been on the Gibraltar side. I talked a little bit about the spends on accelerating some of the customer office and Financial Wellness. I also alluded to just enhancing the overall collection of data and automation that we have in light of the \u2013 I would say really global, not really restricted to Japan, focused on sales suitability. So we\u2019re trying to get that in place and probably accelerating that. In the case of Gibraltar sales, I think that\u2019s really where the market dynamics have been, more challenging for us. As you know, particularly in our third-party distribution channels, we try to be very focused and disciplined about the products that we sell and meeting our return hurdles. And with that in mind, we are experiencing sales declines. We try to focus on recurring premium death protection products. We find those to be much more persistent. And so in the long run, we view those as is really the most attractive products for us to sell, but we also think they\u2019re the most beneficial to our customers. So therefore we\u2019re focusing less on single premium products, which tend to be more variable and subject to more pricing, I\u2019d say, other market factors like interest rates. The good news is that our recurring premium sales have in fact increased nicely within the Life Consultant channel. However, this is being more than offset with lower sales on single-pay U.S. dollar annuities that are impacted both by competition and by the change in rates. I\u2019d say the other notable decline in sales was in the Bank channel, which primarily relates to trying to maintain the pricing discipline that I commented on earlier. And then lastly, we experienced a smaller decline related to the tax law change in the independent agency channel. And as you know, those new regs are out, but there\u2019s a big backlog on developing new products at the FSA. I guess the point I would make there and on that is that despite these challenges, Gibraltar\u2019s in-force block actually grew 2% year-over-year, which again goes back to reflecting the high persistency of the recurring premium products that we sell there. Tom Gallagher : That\u2019s helpful, Scott. Just as a quick follow-up on Japan, POJ or Life Planner in total does have very good persistency as well. It\u2019s still about 90, but that\u2019s actually been declining and it\u2019s declined 90 basis points sequentially. Is there anything going on, on persistency in that part of the business? Scott Sleyster : I don\u2019t really think so. That was a really \u2013 that was a very small change. And if you look at it over \u2013 in the way we tend to is look it over longitudinally, over a long period of time, it still remains quite stable. So I don\u2019t think we see anything at this point that we view as significant. We of course watch it every quarter. Charlie Lowrey : And Tom, this is Charlie, let me just give a little sort of a history of the Bank channel, because it\u2019s important to understand how we think about the Bank channel and that is the marginal sales aspect of it. So in a Bank channel sales can get away from you pretty quickly and we watched that like a hawk. And so what we\u2019re really focused on, as Scott said, is the profitability of the business and the type of product that we sell and that the sales volume will vary as a function of that. So there is more competition, especially on the end based side. And that\u2019s hurt our U.S. dollar sales and recurring premium sales. But in our minds, what we\u2019re doing is protecting the level of profitability and the type of sale we have and letting sales volume vary as a result of that. And that\u2019s the way we\u2019ve approached the bank channel in the past. And it\u2019s completely consistent with the way we\u2019re doing it now. Tom Gallagher : Understood. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with Citi. Your line is open. Suneet Kamath : Thanks. On the assumption review, are there going to be any impacts on your statutory results either in terms of stat earnings or year-end cash flow testing from these changes? Charlie Lowrey : Yes. For life, the stat assumptions are prescribed so there wouldn\u2019t be a stat impact for the life to update. And then there would be \u2013 and then the favorable impact on the retirement update would be \u2013 would flow through to stat. So that\u2019s the extent of it. Suneet Kamath : Okay. And then on the life assumption review, I mean, we\u2019ve been tracking this, I would say every year, it seems like over the past, call it four years, you\u2019ve had maybe $900 million or so of these assumption changes, just in the life business alone. So maybe some color on why is it this business that\u2019s getting so much of this impact and are you confident that kind of have this behind us now in terms of the current assumptions? Steve Pelletier : Suneet, this is Steve. Let me make some kind of overall comments and then I\u2019d invite Ken to expand further. You\u2019re right about our experience over the past few years in the Individual Life business in the annual reviews. And most of that experience has been around adjustments on the mortality front including this year\u2019s. As a reminder though, if you extend the look back over the past six or seven years, our mortality experience has been largely aligned with our expectations over that period. In addition, when you look at it from a Prudential total company standpoint, as we\u2019ve seen, the negative mortality experience in Individual Life, that\u2019s been offset to a quite meaningful degree with positive longevity experience in our retirement business, very much as designed and intended. With that said though, as I mentioned earlier, the ongoing impacts of the assumption updates that we\u2019ve taken cumulatively over the past few years have brought us to a place where we want to bolster and improve the current levels of return in the business. And the three point plan that I mentioned earlier is really how we think about that going forward over the next few years. Ken Tanji : Yes. The only thing I\u2019d add is just a reminder that\u2019s some of the updates that we took a few years ago were related to systems conversions and going through that process and that part is behind us. And then also in terms of assumptions and evaluating the experience where it\u2019s credible, we call it like we see it and we stay current with that. So that\u2019s our philosophy with assumptions. Suneet Kamath : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Andrew Kligerman : Thank you. Just trying to digest the response to Suneet\u2019s question, just simply because it\u2019s happened so many times in the last four years, but I think Ken just said, you call it like you see it. But Steve, you mentioned that you\u2019re exploring different options for the in-force management, including reinsurance. So if you\u2019re doing that and the reinsurer is taking a look at your block, why wouldn\u2019t we expect another charge to come, as they may be uncomfortable with the block? Steve Pelletier : As I mentioned Andrew, we\u2019re looking at a range of reinsurance options, we already have, of course, an active reinsurance program. And that\u2019s been one where our dealings with the reinsurers have been quite productive, even over the past few years. As we\u2019ve had some of these updates and we will continue to explore different options including, as I mentioned an expanded range of them. So it\u2019s part of the picture, but not by any means the totality of\u2026 Andrew Kligerman : Could that conceivably end up in another charge? Charlie Lowrey : Yes. We don\u2019t want to go into specifics in the theoretical. So \u2013 but reinsurance can also be used to narrow volatility as we reinsure more business and trim some of the larger case exposure. So there\u2019s a number of various way that we can think about the benefits associated with reinsurance and we\u2019re looking at that. Andrew Kligerman : Got it. Rob Falzon : It\u2019s rob, the only thing I\u2019d add on is to repeat as to what Ken said is, the intent of the assumption update was to bring current valuation of the liability to our best estimate of what mortality experience we\u2019re actually seeing in the underlying block. And so we would not expect a third-party to look at that and they\u2019d come to some different conclusion than we did. Andrew Kligerman : Got it. And then just in the earlier questions, I think your response was that there\u2019s some backlog with the FSA and some regulatory considerations. Could you elaborate on that? Ken Tanji : That was simply related to the change in the tax law that occurred in February and then was reiterated in July. So carriers like Prudential are designing some new products, but you have to file those products and go through the Q. So it\u2019s kind of the usual thing. But since it was related to a single action by the FSA there\u2019s just a Q. Andrew Kligerman : Got it. And then just with the recent activity at the Japan Post, they had some misspelling, any higher degrees of scrutiny occurring with the regulators? Charlie Lowrey : I guess what \u2013 I would say one, we\u2019re not really, we don\u2019t distribute through Japan Post on the one hand. But to the broader question, I think it was about two years ago, the, the FSA shifted to more of a principle based to kind of a framework kind of moving to global standards. And as they do that, I think they\u2019re rolling out their exam process and focusing more. And I think people are \u2013 as they go through that process, they\u2019re saying, gee, I want to make some modifications or change this or get in line. So I think that\u2019s really, it\u2019s a fairly \u2013 I would say a fairly orderly an expected process, but it is in fact the process that\u2019s underway. It\u2019s already a couple of years out. And my guess is it has a couple more years to go before it\u2019s fully rolled out. Andrew Kligerman : Thanks much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead. Humphrey Lee : Good morning and thank you for taking my question. I have a follow-up question related to Gibraltar\u2019s earnings headwind. I think in Ken\u2019s remarks, you talked about roughly 15 million lower earnings power from lower sales and also high investments. Like on, I just want to see if that is kind of your expectation for the foreseeable future. As you mentioned, the headwinds would be kind of through 2020? Ken Tanji : I guess, what I would say was, we\u2019re trying to, just based off some of the things are going on, and the benefits from putting some of these things in place, we\u2019re trying to get that done more quickly. So I don\u2019t think, I\u2019d say on the expense side you\u2019d expect a lot of that to run through all of 2020. But I guess, I would say I expect this over the next three to four quarters, not the next two. Humphrey Lee : Okay. And then in terms of county, the lower sales and expense impacts, how should we think about that? Because I recall from your Japan Investor Day that you highlighted for both your POJ and Gibraltar business with sales doesn\u2019t really affect your in-force earnings. So I tell a little surprised to see earnings drop as a result of lower sales. So just wondering if is just more of expenses as opposed to sales? Ken Tanji : Well, I think I gave you a proportion that it was a skewed a little heavier to expenses. But when you\u2019re looking at multiyear sales, we\u2019ve come down and it appears that we\u2019re bottoming out at these new levels. And by the way, we are taking actions whether it be in products or incentives, in some new designs to help offset. So we\u2019re not, if you will, standing still while we\u2019re experiencing that. But the cumulative effect of the sales levels being off, where they are and kind of plateauing at this level is also part of the equation. Humphrey Lee : Okay. And then shifting gears to Retirement. Looking at the earnings run rate and outlook seems to be a little bit weaker than where it has been granted low interest rate definitely was the pressure, but I was just wondering if there\u2019s any other things that may have affected the earnings outlook for retirement in general. Steve Pelletier : Humphrey, Its Steve, I\u2019ll address that part of your questions. The impact on retirement run rate earning is largely in the net interest income area. Part of it is what you just spoke about some spread compression as a result of the current rate environment. But another aspect of it is that at the end of last year, we released a significant amount of the AAT reserves in the Retirement business and transfer the assets backing them back to the parent company. And that also contributes to lower investment income for the business in 2019. Humphrey Lee : So in terms, I guess, when you mentioned, the kind of the impact of the AAT reserve releases on the investment income, like how should we think about that? Charlie Lowrey : Yes. So when we updated our assumptions in our Retirement business for AAT that led to a release of those reserves, but also if you recall, we last year we did strengthen our long term care reserves. And so that led to essentially a net \u2013 no net impact overall for the company. So although you\u2019ll see lower earnings in the retirement segment related to that, those reserves went to long term care, which is not included in NOI. Humphrey Lee : Got It. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Next we\u2019ll go to the line of John Nadel with UBS. Your line is open. John Nadel : Hey, thank you. Good morning. I have a couple of quick ones. Rob, it sounded like, with your commentary about PGIM, and an expectation that institutional net flows, we\u2019ll continue this string on an annual basis to positive. I assume that\u2019s within eye towards your pipeline for the back half of the year. Can you just maybe expand on that? Steve Pelletier : John, this is Steve. I\u2019ll address that part of your question. Yes. I think the circumstances around this particular outflow this quarter were mentioned by Charlie. I just mentioned a little bit more about it. It really was a matter of a client looking to consolidate the number of managers they work with. We\u2019re quite familiar with that dynamic. We have very frequently been the beneficiary of it. This was one particular time when the dynamic worked against us. But we still have a great deal of confidence in the ability of the business to continue to demonstrate strong fundamentals and strong net flows continuing the 16 years string on the institutional front. I would say that\u2019s born out of a number of things. Number one, we do see an attractive near term pipeline in the marketplace. And we like our prospects for competing for that opportunity set given strong investment performance, deep expertise across a range of asset classes and investment strategies, and investments that we\u2019ve made in our distribution platform. All of those things taken together have been the contributors and the drivers of solid net flows and we expect they\u2019ll continue to be. John Nadel : Thank you. And then maybe for Ken or Rob, looking at Slide 18 of the deck, I wanted to make sure that I understand how to interpret this, because I think the seasonal portion of this is tremendously helpful and thank you for that. I\u2019m looking at the column that provides the baseline range. And I just want to understand the width of the range by segments. Are we to take that to mean that the \u2013 driven by seasonal and other factors in some quarters, the earnings can be at the low end of the range and then some, the high end of that range? Is that the way to interpret that? Steve Pelletier : Let me maybe explain what that is. This is really just factual. So it is just \u2013 if you look at the last four quarters and you adjust for assumption updates, market experience updates, variable investment incomes, the things that are noted in the footnotes. That\u2019s the actual range that has occurred over the last four quarters. John Nadel : Into to the last four. Got it. Steve Pelletier : Just, there to give you a sense of what the highs and the lows have been. John Nadel : Got you. Okay. So this isn\u2019t sort of a guide thing \u2013 this is just actual, it doesn\u2019t include any growth expectations? Charlie Lowrey : No assumptions. It\u2019s just the facts of the last four quarters. John Nadel : Got you. Perfect. And then our last one is I wanted to try to differentiate between run rate and actual dollar contribution thinking about the wellness initiative. You\u2019ve talked about a $50 million run rate contribution to earnings by the end of this year, but my sense is that the actual dollar contribution of earning in 2019 will be negligible. And first, I wanted to make sure I understand that correctly. And then second, if we fast forward and think about 2020, how should we differentiate between run rate and actual contribution? Rob Falzon : John, its Rob, let me try to address that. With regard to 2019 specifically recall that the expenses are largely backend weighted as well, and so\u2026 John Nadel : Yes, I\u2019m separating the expense item. Rob Falzon : Yes. So the idea is in 2019, we\u2019ll incur those expenses and get to that run rate, level of savings. But by the time we\u2019ve incurred all those expenses, but because it happened so late in the year, to your point, there will be a relatively modest contribution in 2019 from an earning standpoint simply because both the expenses and the earnings are going to be concentrated in the latter part of the year. As you get into 2020 and beyond, what you see then is, from a pure earning standpoint, you\u2019ll see a combination of the benefit of the run rate from the prior year and then some portion of the building run rate during the course of that year contributing into the current year. What we intend to do is, and we\u2019ll begin at the end of this year, we\u2019ll provide better visibility into both the sources of the expenses so you understand what initiatives they\u2019re linked to. And then importantly, how much and where we should expect to see the earnings of benefits associated with those initiatives. Right now it\u2019s just not material enough to provide that kind of detail. As we get further into this year, when we have more materiality, we\u2019ll provide that kind of insight and I think that will provide you a better basis then for being able to assess not just the run rate impact but how much of that run rate would be in the current year as opposed to for the succeeding year. John Nadel : That\u2019s helpful. If I can squeeze one more follow-up on that. So if you achieve $500 million, what\u2019s the calendar year where we should see the full contribution of that $500 million? Ken Tanji : That would be \u2013 we would achieve that by the end of 2022, and so you would see in 2023 the full year benefit of that. John Nadel : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go to the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alex Scott : Hi. I just wanted to touch on individual annuities. I guess the ROA seems to continue to trend down there, and I know the long-term ROA target was a bit lower than where you have been running but I guess equity margins been strong. A little of bit of a surprise to me, that we\u2019d see that kind of accelerating down to the long-term ROA trend as it has with that the economic backdrop? Appreciating the rates had gone down too, but can you help us think through that? Should we just assume we\u2019re at that long-term ROA now? Any color it would be appreciated. Ken Tanji : Yes, sure. It\u2019s Ken. So first, our ROA evidences the high profitability of our variable annuity business and the strong ROE. And as we\u2019ve mentioned in the past, we expected the ROA would trend down over time as our business persists and moves into lower fee tiers, but also as a result of our strategy to diversify our product mix. Now, it should also probably useful to know that our earnings are less sensitive to markets than our account values and that\u2019s due to our hedging program. And so in the second quarter you saw, as you mentioned, the combination of two things; equity markets rising and interest rates falling and both those lead to increases in account values. And so it was really a denominator that led to the trimming of the ROA. And the point is here is our hedging program makes our earnings more stable than our account values. Alex Scott : Got it. Okay. And then maybe a follow-up, just thinking more high level, you guys up to the high end of the ROE guide for the intermediate term that the outlook, has anything changed since that time or \u2013 just thinking through how much lower the earnings power is today from what I had thought at the time you were making those comments? It seems a bit more aspirational sitting here today than it did at that time. So can you help me think through, is there anything other than the Financial Wellness program I should be thinking about that would get you closer to the midpoint of that intermediate range? Rob Falzon : So Alex, it\u2019s Rob. I think Ken did a good job of walking through sort of the impacts of \u2013 just sort of think about the guidance that we gave and then the change in that guidance being reflected in sort of a handful of items that we\u2019ve articulated. When we think about what we\u2019ve articulated on Investor Day, I think what\u2019s important to understand is that when we\u2019re at Investor Day what we\u2019re talking about direction and we\u2019re talking about strategy, and then the associated financial outcomes that result from that direction and strategy. And as we think about those, we measure those in years, not in quarters. Obviously, in guidance and in calls like this, we talk about sort of the more near term results. On Investor Day, I think what I can reflect on is, first, Charlie had in his remarks indicated that we \u2013 that march towards, what we continue to believe is an achievable level of higher earnings and higher ROE would be non-linear. And I think you\u2019re seeing some of that non-linearity in the current quarter. Ken talked about both the potential for the life assumption update he told \u2013 I think you mentioned that we were taking a hard look at those assumptions during the Investor Day. And then also we\u2019ve provided then and previously market sensitivity. So none of that I would consider to be particularly new information. And Scott, even when he talked about the international business, as you mentioned earlier, spoke to the fact that we would be adopting many of the initiatives that we have begun in the U.S. into Japan and we would expect to be making similar type investments there. So I think that per Charlie\u2019s opening remarks that we remain very confident in the messages that we delivered on Investor Day, regarding both the intermediate and long-term prospects for our businesses. And nothing that\u2019s occurred in the current period, it causes us to feel any differently about what we messaged on Investor Day. Alex Scott : Got it. Thanks for the responses. Operator : Thank you. We will go to the line of Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Erik Bass : Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to come back to the mortality topic. And I was curious, is the deterioration related to any specific vintages or types of policies, are you really reflecting a broader trend? Steve Pelletier : Eric, it\u2019s Steve. I\u2019ll address your question. Main point is that the updates really related to longer dated vintages, earlier vintages in our book of business. In regard to looking at specific product categories that the onetime impact is largely experienced in the universal life block. The ongoing impact is primarily in universal life, but with some impact in other parts of the business as well, including term. Erik Bass : Got it. And then you\u2019re having not quite a complete offsetting adjustment, but obviously the retirement business is benefiting on the longevity side, but you have differences in business mix there. So what is it? I guess it\u2019s driving the positive adjustment on that side of the business? Steve Pelletier : Yes. The way we look at that, Eric, is that when we perform our annual review of assumptions and other refinements, the nature of the updates we make just as you\u2019re commenting, they vary from business to business and will naturally lead to differences in the extent and magnitude of onetime impacts versus ongoing impacts. The nature of the updates we made in our retirement business led us to record the more meaningful onetime adjustment that we mentioned and expected benefit payments. And while there were some ongoing benefits from our review when the retirement business, they\u2019re not of the same magnitude of the negative ongoing impact that we see in Individual Life, so that\u2019s why we emphasize that point about Individual Life. Erik Bass : Got it. And just to be \u2013 make sure we have it correct, what would you size that ongoing impact for Individual Life? And is it something that should persist into perpetuity? Charlie Lowrey : Yes, it\u2019s about $25 million a quarter. And it would be recurring for the foreseeable future. Erik Bass : Got it. Charlie Lowrey : But I want to mention, the things that Steve has in mind and the business has in mind too, to help offset some of that that we talked about earlier. Erik Bass : Thank you, that\u2019s helpful. Operator : Thank you. And due to the elapsed time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Charlie Lowrey for any closing comments. Charlie Lowrey : Thanks. I\u2019d like to summarize our thinking and the actions we\u2019re taking because we\u2019ve talked about a lot of different things on this call and I\u2019ll divide into a couple of categories; one is the clarity of earnings; and two are some of the operational actions that we\u2019ve highlighted. So in terms of clarity of earnings, we are in the process of simplifying our earnings and clarifying the visibility of our drivers and financial outcomes. And we\u2019re taking efforts to help you understand our earnings trend and has taken some material steps this quarter to do so, and we will continue to do so. In terms of actual operations, we positioned 2019 and our guidance in 2019 in terms of a year of transition, and making investments that would enable us to grow in subsequent years and we\u2019re taking actions accordingly. So we talked about the investment in future work, which should produce $500 million of margin improvement over the next three years. Now, there are costs associated with that, as Rob indicated, and these initiatives are beginning to come through this year. And so these costs are upfront, which means there\u2019s a lag in terms of payback. So that\u2019s the first point. The second is we aren\u2019t happy with the performance of our life business. And consistent with Steve comments, we are seeking to increase the performance of the business as well as looking at ways to optimize the in-force book. And finally there have been higher expenses in certain businesses like Scott called out with Gibraltar. And as we think about changing the way in which operate, we have to spend money on new ways of becoming more efficient, investing in technology and platforms, et cetera. And some of these costs will be ongoing. It\u2019s really a cost of doing business in the current environment and others will be transitory, a surge and then levering \u2013 leveling off and Gibraltar falls into the latter category with higher expenses tapering off during the first half of probably next year. Now all this is to say that not everything can be solved overnight, nor will the results coming from the solutions be linear. But we do have a real sense of urgency as you would expect us to have and that we spoke about on Investor Day. And what I can assure you is that we firmly believe that many of these initiatives and challenges actually provide extraordinary opportunities over time, which is why we have high conviction around the ROE and EPS targets that we stated on Investor Day. Now on a personal note and speaking for the entire management team, we don\u2019t like disappointing our investors or other constituencies. On the contrary, we\u2019d like to excel. And while I can\u2019t make any statements as to what the next quarter or quarters will provide, what I can absolutely assure you of is that we\u2019re working on executing our plan, with the intended results of changing the trend line in the right direction. We look forward to keeping you updated on our performance and the tangible progress that we make as we strive to develop better financial outcomes for our customers and just as importantly sustainable results for our shareholders. Thank you all for taking the time to join us today. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using the AT&T Executive TeleConference service. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Darin Arita. Please go ahead. Darin Arita : Thank you, Cynthia. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today\u2019s call are Charlie Lowrey, Chairman and CEO; Rob Falzon, Vice Chairman; Steve Pelletier, Head of U.S. Businesses; along with Andy Sullivan, our next Head of U.S. Businesses; Scott Sleyster, Head of International Businesses; Ken Tanji, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by Charlie, Rob and Ken, and then we will take your questions. Today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of such measures to the comparable GAAP measures and a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Please see the slide titled Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures in the appendix to today\u2019s presentation, which can be found on our website at investor.prudential.com. I\u2019ll hand it over to Charlie. Charlie Lowrey : Thank you, Darin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on this call. Yesterday we reported third quarter earnings per share of $3.22. We also reported a year-to-date ROE of 13%. I\u2019ll begin by discussing our progress in executing our financial wellness strategy. We are committed to delivering a broader set of financial wellness solutions to more people in new ways, leveraging our scale across multiple distribution channels and drawing on our expertise, including product development and asset management. During the quarter, we took steps to expand our digital distribution capabilities through the announced acquisition of Assurance IQ, a fee-based and capital-light growth engine. Assurance is a leading direct-to-consumer platform for financial wellness solutions that enables us to serve a different demographic segment, including the mass and middle markets. Over time, we believe we can expand these capabilities internationally. The Assurance acquisition, which closed in October, also provides attractive financial benefits and significant upside potential. Assurance shares our purpose of solving the financial challenges of a changing world, which is at the core of who we are. In that vein, I\u2019m pleased to note that Fortune has named Prudential to its prestigious Change the World list for a second consecutive year. We also made progress in the quarter towards our margin expansion goals by evolving and transforming the way we do business across the organization. Along these lines, we launched a voluntary separation program in October for segments of our U.S. workforce. These efforts are intended to better position us to meet the needs of our customers while driving greater speed and efficiency. Finally, we continue to advance our efforts to reduce the impact of market fluctuations and add transparency to our quarterly financial performance. As a result, beginning in the fourth quarter, our corporate and other results will be less affected by changes in the equity market and our own stock price. Looking ahead, we are taking a very disciplined approach to pricing to help offset the impact of rates on new business profitability, which will have an obvious effect on some of our sales. We are encouraged by our progress and are moving quickly and with conviction, to implement the plans we have set forward to deliver meaningful solutions and long-term value to our customers and shareholders. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our business performance for the quarter. Rob? Rob Falzon : Thank you, Charlie. I\u2019ll provide an update on how we\u2019re executing on our strategy to leverage our multi-channel distribution product and asset management expertise, and scale to deliver financial opportunity to a wider demographic within our U.S. Financial Wellness, PGIM and International businesses. As shown on Slide 4, U.S. Financial Wellness currently represents our workplace and individual solutions divisions that produce a diversified source of earnings from these investment spread and underwriting income. Beginning in the fourth quarter, it will also include fee-based earnings from the Assurance business, earnings which are not correlated to equity markets, interest rates or credit. We continue to execute our strategy to expand our addressable market. Our Financial Wellness proposition is resonating with our workplace customers and with the employees of those customers, driving higher participation rates in the employer benefit programs and increased engagement with our advice platform. The number of people who have activated our digital financial wellness platform has increased to 9 million as of September 30. This platform provides a digital venue to address a variety of needs, including education on financial wellness topics and assessment of financial health. We\u2019re also growing individual relationships and expect to provide additional solutions to the employees of our workplace customers as well as other retail customers. One way we deliver these solutions is through LINK by Prudential, which is our highly interactive personalized online resource that enables people to create a path toward achieving their financial goals. Earlier this year we began to deploy LINK on our workplace platform and we have already made it available to roughly 2.3 million people. We are on track to meet our goal of 2.5 million people by the end of the year. And notably, with the October closing of our acquisition of Assurance, we have significantly expanded our addressable market with approximately 19 million individuals, who are actively seeking insurance solutions. Assurance\u2019s direct-to-consumer platform and end-to-end engagement model, which includes over 3000 agents, enables us to serve more people along the socioeconomic spectrum. In addition, this platform will enable us to expand our range of available solutions for our workplace customers by adding third-party provided health and property and casualty insurance as well as Medicare coverage. We\u2019re also making progress streamlining our operations to increase agility while driving efficiencies and enhancing the customer experience. We\u2019re on track to achieve $50 million in run rate margin expansion by the end of 2019, and expect this to increase to $500 million by the end of 2022. This is being accomplished through a number of programs that we have underway. In the current quarter, we incurred about $20 million of implementation costs to support these programs. Shifting to a discussion of third quarter trends and the underlying fundamentals of our businesses, I\u2019ll start with flows in the U.S. Financial Wellness this quarter, focusing on our retirement and annuities businesses. Our retirement business had net outflows of $2.7 billion driven by a single large client lapse in our full service business. This was partially offset by strong sales in the quarter as the market continues to be active, including episodic large client activity. The Institutional Investments business had net inflows of $600 million, including $3.6 billion of longevity risk transfer transactions. Year-to-date we have closed $17 billion of longevity reinsurance transactions and we have a strong pipeline. This elevated deal activity is driven by our strong competitive positioning and innovation as well as by UK pension funds de-risking ahead of Brexit. While we did not close any funded PRT transactions in the third quarter and recent declines in interest rates have impacted the funding levels of these plans, the fourth quarter has started well and we have a solid pipeline of pending transactions. Our annuities business experienced $1.1 billion of net outflows driven by normal account withdrawals as well as by elevated lapses as certain contracts move out of the surrender period. We expect this elevated level of lapses to persist through 2020. This was partially offset by an increase in sales including the impact of launching our proved secure fixed indexed annuity last year and expanding into the IMO channel this quarter. However, we expect the current low interest rate environment to continue to pressure sales. Turning to Slide 5, our strategy in PGIM, our asset management business is to combine our multi-manager model with global distribution and affiliated flows to grow in higher value added strategies that serves investors globally. PGIM is a top 10 global asset manager with $1.3 billion of assets under management. It ranks as the fifth largest investor in fixed income and the third largest investor in alternative investments with significant real estate and private investment platforms. As the investment engine of Prudential, it benefits from a symbiotic relationship with our U.S. financial wellness and International Insurance businesses. PGIM\u2019s asset origination capabilities and investment management expertise provide a competitive advantage helping our businesses to bring enhanced solutions and more value to our customers, both retail and institutional. And our businesses, in turn, provide a differentiated source of growth for PGIM through affiliated AUM flows that complement its successful third-party track record of performance and growth, generated $800 million of net third-party flows during the third quarter. Our third-party net retail flows were $3 billion. Strong investment performance in our growing ETFs and UCITS platforms and record mutual fund sales delivered solid fixed income flows, partially offset by equity outflows. And our third-party institutional outflows were $2.2 billion, mainly driven by a single institutional fixed income client withdrawal of $2.9 billion due to manager consolidation. We serve many of the world\u2019s largest Institutional investors and as a result, will experience large idiosyncratic inflows and outflows from time-to-time. Our asset management fees benefited from record assets under management due to market appreciation and continued robust fixed income flows. Strong investment performance and expertise across a broad range of asset classes has allowed us to continue to attract flows into higher-return strategies. Approximately 80% or more of assets under management have outperformed their benchmarks over the last three, five and 10 year periods. We continue to broaden and globalize our products and capabilities by developing and launching private and alternative investments, expanding in retail and international markets. Our multi-manager model, strong track record of private originations and demonstrated investment performance, as well as the investments we were making in our distribution capabilities, will position us to generate positive flows over time and to grow our earnings even absent the Wells Fargo fee arrangement which ends this year. Turning to Slide 6. Our international business includes our world-class Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated business model with unique distribution as well as other operations in high-growth margins like Brazil. Our Life Planner strategy is to grow our high quality distribution with a focus on needs-based sales. Emerging markets we look to combine Prudential strengths with global expertise to serve customers in a non-traditional way. Life Planner sales, which are about half of the total International sales in the current quarter, increased by 8% compared to the year-ago quarter. This was driven by record Life Planner account and higher U.S. dollar sales in Japan as well as by continued growth in our Brazil operations. Sales for Gibraltar, which represents the other half of International, were 11% lower than a year ago. This primarily reflects lower single pay U.S. dollar fixed annuity sales in our Life Consultants channel as we continue to focus on recurring pay Protection products. In addition, the recent decline in U.S. interest rates resulted in lower crediting rates, which also affected sales of U.S. dollar-denominated products. We also experienced lower production in our independent agency channel and lower bank channel sales due to continued heightened competitive conditions. We\u2019ll continue to innovate new products and consider pricing actions while focusing on maintaining our target level of profitability to improve sales over time. Summary, in order to generate profitable growth and attractive returns, we\u2019re expanding our distribution of product solutions, leveraging our asset management expertise and focused on engaging more deeply with our customers. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Ken. Ken Tanji : Thanks, Rob. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 7, which provides additional insight into our fourth quarter earnings relative to our third quarter results. We begin with our third quarter pretax adjusted operating income, which was $1.7 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $3.22 on an after tax basis. Then we adjust for the following items. First, we adjust a variable investment income to a normalized level, which is worth at $65 million. Second, the fourth quarter will include seasonal expenses and implementation costs related to the acceleration of our financial wellness strategy. We expect this will lower results in the fourth quarter by approximately $280 million resulting in an expected loss in the corporate and other segment of $475 million to $500 million inclusive of the cost of our financial wellness initiatives. There will also be additional costs in the fourth quarter related to the voluntary separation program that Charlie mentioned. This is all part of the $600 million to $700 million of implementation costs to accelerate our financial wellness strategy as we discussed on Investor Day. Third, there are other considerations that we expect will result \u2013 will increase results by approximately $25 million on a net basis in the fourth quarter, and fourth, we anticipate a $10 million reduction in the quarterly net investment income from portfolio reinvestment. Assuming reinvestment rates are held flat with the third quarter. Absent a change in interest rates, the $00.2 per share for one quarter would compound $0.30 per share over the five quarter period ending December, 2020. This assumes a 7% annual turnover on $370 billion fixed income portfolio with new money yields 65 basis points below disposition yields on average. Combined, this gets us to a baseline of $2.50 per share for the fourth quarter, before including the impact of future share purchases, business growth and market impacts. This baseline includes a few items that puts it below our typical earnings level. First, we have seasonal expenses in the fourth quarter. We expect those expenses to be similar to prior years at about $125 million to $175 million. Second, we expect about $95 million of financial wellness implementation costs in the fourth quarter. And third, we expect $55 million of higher typical expenses \u2013 higher than typical expenses in Life Planner. These three items total about $0.58 per share and explained elevated level expense expected in the fourth quarter baseline. While we have provided these items to consider, there may be other factors that affect fourth quarter earnings per share. A few additional items to note. First, we issued 5.5 million shares in the fourth quarter for the assurance acquisition. Second, as Charlie mentioned in his remarks, we have taken further action to reduce fluctuation of quarterly earnings by reducing the impact of movement in Prudential\u2019s stock and equity \u2013 in the equity markets on long-term deferred compensation expenses. Also on Slide 17, we have provided updated information regarding seasonal items by business. We hope that you continue to find our new disclosures including our baseline earnings per share information helpful in understanding the earnings power of our businesses. We have indicated over the past few years, we are considering alternatives to how we approach guidance with the new disclosures now in place and provided on a regular basis. We have decided not to provide annual EPS guidance or host an outlook call in December. We believe our enhanced disclosures and processes provide insightful information on a more frequent basis. Turning to Slide 8. I\u2019ll provide an update on capital deployment, liquidity and leverage. We feel very good about the overall strength of our capital position. We returned $1.4 billion to shareholders during the current quarter through dividends and share repurchases. Our share repurchase authorization for the remainder of the year is $500 million as of September 30. And over the last five years, we\u2019ve increased our dividend per share by 16% per year on average. Our current quarterly dividend of $1 represents a 4% yield on our adjusted book value. We also continued to maintain a rock-solid balance sheet. Our regulatory capital ratios continue to be above our AA financial strength target levels and our financial leverage ratio remains better than our target. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company was $6.2 billion at the end of the quarter and that was above our top end of our $3 billion to $5 billion liquidity target range. As shown on the slide, we\u2019ve provided a pro forma of the highly liquid asset balance that reflects the amount that funded the acquisition of Assurance in early October and brings the balance within our target range. We will look to continue to invest in the growth of our businesses, assess acquisition opportunities to build scale or gain capabilities and return capital to shareholders. Turning to Slide 9 and in summary, we are accelerating our strategy and positioning our businesses to deliver long-term growth. We remain on track to achieve $50 million in run rate margin expansion by the end of 2019 and $500 million by the end of 2022. We\u2019ve generated a record high adjusted book value per share and continue to generate strong cash flows that support consistent growth in dividends and other distributions to shareholders, and we maintain a robust capital and liquidity position with financial flexibility. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go to the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alex Scott : Hey, good morning. So first question I had is on variable annuities. And I guess, we\u2019re seeing the ROA, it really starting to come down. And I just wanted to see if you could dimension for us, what\u2019s impacting that? Is it sort of the spread you\u2019re making on the riders? Is it just the fee levels coming down? I think previously you talked about 115 bps or 116 bps or so, we\u2019re already below that. I mean, should we expect a significantly lower long-term sort of trendable level at this point? Ken Tanji : Yes. Hey, this is Ken, I\u2019ll take that. First, our variable annuity business continues to be very profitable and that\u2019s, although, it\u2019s a bit lower, it\u2019s still has a high ROA and a strong ROE. We\u2019ve mentioned in the past that we\u2019d expect the ROA to trend over, over time as policies both move into lower fee tiers and as we continue to diversify our product mix to solutions with less equity market sensitivity. So that continues to play out. And while the ROA is a general \u2013 generally a good benchmark for profitability, it will adjust when markets move significantly. And interest rates have declined pretty significantly in 2019 down by about \u2013 over 100 basis points year-to-date. So while the decline in rates increases the account value, it affects earnings by the combination of higher benefit ratios and higher DAC amortization. So despite the decline in rates, again, the business continues to be very profitable and generating quarterly cash flow, we still like the profitability albeit at a lower ROA. Alex Scott : Got it. Okay. And then my follow-up question is I guess more broadly on expenses. There\u2019s some acceleration in Life Planner, a little bit more next quarter. You\u2019ve got the digital expenses going on. But I guess you\u2019ve also got Assurance IQ coming on, which I think there were some synergies with some of the things you\u2019re doing on digital capabilities. So just wondering if you could provide more detailed thoughts on how much you\u2019d be looking to spend over the next year or so. And what of offset there is from Assurance coming online? And if we have any more like big accelerations like there was in Life Planner for other segments, like once you get past whatever you\u2019re focusing on in Life Planner? Charlie Lowrey : Let me just \u2013 this is Charlie. Let me start in and then others can join in. So we said with Assurance that there would be a certain amount of expense synergies. I think we said $25 million to $50 million next year and then additional after that. So you can expect those to come in over time. Those are separate and distinct from some of the other expenditures that we\u2019re making or some of the other savings we\u2019re seeing in the margin improvements. Ken Tanji : And then the other area for the quarter was International, where we did see a shift of some expenses and a higher level of expenses in the quarter. Alex Scott : And so, is that really onetime or are you going through any kind of process, where you might be assessing needs for other segments that are outside of the digital initiative that\u2019s in corporate? Scott Sleyster : Hi, Alex. This is Scott. I think, Darin, gave some guidance on what will be recurring and non-recurring, but there\u2019s a couple of big things going on. First of all to the specific quarters, as I mentioned before, we see evolving regulatory oversight and we\u2019re trying to put the infrastructure in place to continue to be at industry best practices. And some of that\u2019s rolling out actually not just in Japan, but around the world. As I mentioned at Investor Day, we also have been following some of the technology upgrades and the digital upgrades that occurred in the U.S. We kind of follow what worked well and we\u2019re rolling some of those out across the Board. And then this quarter, we actually had some additional litigation and other reserves. And finally, some things we\u2019re doing on process improvement and automation. So, I would say it really falls into those two big buckets. We were playing a bit of catch-up on the \u2013 improving regulatory best practices. And then we had some significant initiative rollouts that we were doing in International, that I would say lag the U.S. by about a year. We\u2019re most of the way through that. And so I think if you look at the adjustments, we have, call it, $55 million in accelerated additional spending in the fourth quarter that will disappear as we hit our run rate going into 2020. I think we would say that\u2019s largely our new baseline. Alex Scott : Got it. That\u2019s all very helpful. Thank you. Ken Tanji : And I\u2019ll just add for the quarter, keep in mind, corporate was lower and there was sort of a couple of pieces there. We had lower long-term compensation expense related to the change in our share price. That as we mentioned will no longer occur going forward as we\u2019ve modified our long-term compensation program to no longer need to have that stock price flowing through our expense. And then corporate expenses were also a little bit lower. So if you look at corporate and international, they were somewhat offsetting. Alex Scott : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Erik Bass : Hi, thank you. So you\u2019ve talked about the outlook for EPS in the fourth quarter, but it sounds like that includes a number of one-off expenses in addition to the normal seasonal impacts. So it\u2019s not, I guess, a real reflection of your earnings power. Therefore, can you help us think about a more reasonable earnings baseline for 2020? And is it really adding back the $0.54 of items, so thinking of something in kind of the low $3 range before buybacks and growth? Ken Tanji : Yes. Hi, Erik, it\u2019s Ken. There\u2019s actually a number of ways that you can think about this and look at this. So I\u2019ll first \u2013 I\u2019ll start with the baseline that we gave at the end of the second quarter going into third quarter, which was about $3. So that was sort of where we thought in the middle of the year our earnings power was. The third quarter results came in at $3.22 and that was a little bit above that because we had favorable variable investment income and a favorable underwriting expense across our businesses. And as I mentioned in our last comments, the expense is kind of offset between corporate and other international. So if you adjusted that, you\u2019ve got to a number that was a little better than $3. Now, in the fourth quarter baseline, you do have a number of items, like I said in my opening remarks that make it a little bit below our typical earnings level. The first is our seasonal expenses that nothing unique going on this year, typical to what we see in the fourth quarter. We have the Financial Wellness implementation costs, again, very consistent with what we articulated at Investor Day. And then third, we have an expectation of little higher expenses in our international businesses. If you put those items altogether and you adjusted for that, you\u2019d be back at earnings level a little bit over $3. So I think that\u2019s the way we\u2019re thinking about our earnings power over those timeframes. Rob Falzon : Erik, it\u2019s Rob. Let me just sort of pick up on that, sort of looking ahead off that baseline. Ken mentioned in his commentary that we do have interest rate sensitivity going forward and we\u2019ve given some guidance on that. So that\u2019s sort of updated and will be a headwind as contrary to what would otherwise have underlying business growth. And then obviously, the very significant increase we have in growth is a result of capital deployment from shares. The other piece to think about with interest rates is that we\u2019ll have lower sales that come out of that in a lower interest rate environment as well, or at least that\u2019s what we\u2019re anticipating. Recognizing all that, we are being very proactive. We\u2019re managing sales through product pricing, design and mix. We\u2019re managing costs. So that includes implementing the previously announced financial wellness initiatives that that Ken covered as well. And we\u2019ve been actively deploying capital for growth. That was evidenced very clearly in the Assurance IQ acquisition, which is not sensitive to rates or equity markets. But also the things that we\u2019ve done in PGIM and its investment capabilities and its distribution capabilities and the other global technology and distribution initiatives that we have, all of which we think will contribute to fundamental growth, and then obviously, as I mentioned, the share repurchases. So deploying capital for growth, all of that we believe gives us the ability in combination with what\u2019s happening on international in terms of our continued ability to grow the inforce that gives us confidence that we can continue to show a differentiated level or we can show going forward a differentiated level of growth and ROE vis-\u00e0-vis industry in light of the sort of the macro headwinds that we outlined. Erik Bass : Thank you. That\u2019s a helpful detail. Maybe going on the interest rate comment, it seems like your interest rates sensitivity has increased versus the $0.30 impact for 100 basis point move that you gave on last year\u2019s outlook call. Just hoping you could give a little bit more color on why that\u2019s the case. Ken Tanji : Yes, sure. I\u2019ll cover that. Again, a year ago when we issued guidance, interest rates were in a different zone and our guidance a year ago assumed 2019 would have interest rates above 3% if you use the 10-year U.S. treasury as a benchmark. We were at rate levels that are now over 100 basis points below that. And when we gave that guidance last year, we mentioned that our sensitivity to 100 basis point decline would be $0.30 per share. And that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019ve experienced as we\u2019ve gone through the year and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve experienced in our financial results as well. So the impact that we\u2019ve experienced in 2019 is very consistent with what we provided as sensitivities again a year ago. But for me, here, the rates are at a lower start point and we also have more U.S. dollar business in Japan. We have more business that\u2019s crediting rate minimums. So there is, and it\u2019s not linear as well, and we do have a greater impact. And you also have to consider there\u2019s an impact on the present value of claims at a lower discount rate. So those are the reasons that we have more interest rate sensitivity now, and it all has to do with the lower rate environment. Erik Bass : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with Citi. Your line is open. Suneet Kamath : Thanks. Just to follow-up on that, Ken. Just as we think about this rate pressure, potentially compounding over time, the $0.02 is eventually becoming a much bigger number. If rates don\u2019t move up, isn\u2019t this going to pretty much offset some of the margin expansion that you are targeting as associated with the Financial Wellness initiative? Ken Tanji : The interest rate impact, again, assuming rates don\u2019t change, does build over time, eventually it does dissipate as the portfolio more fully turns over. And this is exactly the experience that we had. If you go back a number of years as we shifted from the then rate environment to what was the more recent rate environment, now we\u2019re going through that again. So that phenomenon is not new. It\u2019s how it plays out. And so I think it will work its way through in multiples waves as you go out, but again, dissipates eventually over time as the portfolio turns over. Rob Falzon : So they just call out in the deck \u2013 it\u2019s Rob, in the deck that we provided, we gave you the sort of a sensitivity of rates based on the delta between our third quarter new money rates and the yield on the portfolio that\u2019d be turning over on a go forward basis. That\u2019s about 65 basis points. So vis-\u00e0-vis where we are today, if rates modestly rise to something that\u2019s sort of in the mid-2s, not very different from where we were just a little while ago, this phenomena begins to wear off. Suneet Kamath : Got it. Okay. And then just on the decision to not host an outlook call, I guess, for next year. Typically, it would be on that call that we would get a sense of how you\u2019re thinking about capital return for the upcoming year and a view or an outlook on year-end AAT reserves. So since we\u2019re not having that call, just wondering if you could provide some commentary on how you\u2019re thinking about these two things at this point? Ken Tanji : Yes. So first, I\u2019ll start with ATT, given lower rates, we would have a rise in asset adequacy testing reserves. But we do have derivative, interest rate derivative hedges that would have gains as well to offset that. So we still feel very good about the RBC level of our \u2013 of Prudential Insurance Company of America. In terms of our capital returns, that\u2019s a decision that the Board will make in December. And we\u2019ll get that information out once the Board makes that decision and does its authorization. Our free cash flow profile has been very consistent and our capital management approach has also been very consistent. So for now you can factor that into your thinking. Suneet Kamath : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Tom Gallagher : Good morning. Ken, just going through the slide that discusses the corporate loss, if I take the $475 million for the 4Q guide and then I strip out the $150 million sort of the midpoint of higher seasonal 4Q expenses and the $95 million of onetime restructuring expenses, that gets me to a corporate loss of about $230 million. I think the guidance you guys have provided has been over $300 million a quarter as more of a normalized corporate loss. I just want to know, are you implying that you would expect the corporate loss to be lower on a go-forward basis? Or is there \u2013 is a little over $300 million still a decent quarterly loss expectation? Ken Tanji : Tom, the one thing I think, that I think you have a little bit off there is the $150 million of seasonal doesn\u2019t all occur in corporate and other, only about half of it does. So I think if you make that consideration you\u2019re more in line with where our corporate and other run rate has been. Tom Gallagher : Okay. Thanks for that clarification. The other question I had is on the \u2013 just a follow-up on capital return cash flow. I think based on \u2013 I understand there\u2019s been some GAAP earnings pressure here, but can you talk about how cash flow visibility is playing out as you head into 2020? Would you still expect a similar, call it, 65% conversion ratio? Or will that be changing based on where interest rates are in both Japan and the U.S.? Ken Tanji : Yes. Tom, our cash flow engines are still very much intact. So, first for the businesses that have been providing quarterly dividends, PGIM and our annuities business, as you can see those have been very consistent and regular and paid quarterly. And Japan paid a dividend this quarter and the third quarter as well. And we\u2019ll be filing for a dividend from PICA in the fourth quarter. So, yes, rates will decrease net investment income and have some modest impact as we talked about with our sensitivities. But in general, our cash flow picture is quite strong and quite consistent. Tom Gallagher : Got you. And then just one final follow-up, if I could. The market related experience adjustment factor, which was I think around negative $300 million to net income this quarter. Was that just a onetime adjustment outside of the actuarial review to reflect macro? Or can you just provide some color on that? Thanks. Ken Tanji : Yes, sure. No, that wasn\u2019t a onetime adjustment. So that adjustment occurs to update our discount rates related to our best estimates of insurance liabilities and the amortization of deferred acquisition costs. And it didn\u2019t lead to a charge for the quarter. Having said that, we had other gains as well. And if you looked at a GAAP net income, it was actually above operating income. So overall, our GAAP profile was pretty in line with our operating profile. Tom Gallagher : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Nadel with UBS. Your line is open. John Nadel : Good morning, everybody. Maybe a question for Rob or Ken. It sounds like this is more macro driven. And maybe you can correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but it sounds like your expectations are that sort of given in particular sustained low rates. Some insurance products are simply less attractive to customers. And as a result your expectation is that sales in such an environment would be somewhat pressured, maybe down. First question is, do I have that right or is there something else to that story? And then the second or related question is, should we expect that at least in the short-term, as a result of that environment, your free cash flow could actually be better. And maybe we ought to consider potentially at least some incremental capital deployments or capital return to shareholders? Charlie Lowrey : Yes. John, this is Charlie. Let me start and then some others will jump into it. Let me just start philosophically about sales. So the answer is as interest rates decrease, absolutely, sales will \u2013 may well decrease as we change pricing, and as certain products become much less profitable for us and we\u2019ve always talked about a sustained level of profitability over time. And so what we have to calibrate between is making sure that our products meet our hurdle rates on the one hand, and two, sustaining distribution on the other hand. And we\u2019re always calibrating between that, but we will \u2013 we have already and will continue to raise pricing, lower crediting rates to do whatever it takes in order to maintain a level of profitability that makes sense for the company and shareholders. And at the same time, look at what a minimum level of sales would be in order to maintain, what is a world-class distribution system as we go forward. That\u2019s what we\u2019re toggling, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re toggling on those two issues. And you will see that as we go through. But we have already raised pricing and taken multiple pricing actions both domestically and internationally. Steve Pelletier : John, its Steve. Maybe I\u2019ll amplify Charlie\u2019s comments and get a little bit more specific on what I think is a primary example of it, which is in the annuities business. Recently with the decline in interest rates, we have been active in making product changes that reduce the level of product benefits and effectively increased pricing. But that relates to over the past couple of months reducing payout rates by 40 points to 45 points in some of \u2013 in our products by reducing a roll-up rate on HDI by 50 basis points. This is something that we do as Charlie\u2019s mentioned in the normal course of business, in order to manage the business for sustainable, profitable growth. Well, certainly looking to maintain relevance with distribution partners and a competitive value proposition for customers. We\u2019ve seen some competitors take some actions, but frankly, we\u2019ve made more changes than most. And as a result it\u2019s possible that we could see our sales trajectory decline in the near term and we simply see that as an outcome of how we manage the business. And I would mention, as how we\u2019ve managed that business for an extended period of time. If you look over a multiyear period in the annuities business, we\u2019ve certainly been active in the marketplace throughout, but we\u2019ve been significantly more active during periods where capital market conditions were more supportive of product features and at issue returns. And we\u2019d been relatively less active in periods where capital market conditions were not so supportive, if that over an extended period of time that is built the in-force block in that business that has the characteristics, pardon me, Ken mentioned earlier of strong profitability, robust returns and solid cash flow. John Nadel : Yes. Listen, I appreciate the need to balance, right, maintenance \u2013 or maintaining distribution versus profitability of sales. And I was just wondering if there was \u2013 if you\u2019d expect that sales would be down sufficiently such that, maybe it has a near term or a short-term impact on free cash flow. But we can take that offline. Charlie Lowrey : Well, that\u2019s \u2013 John, I can cover that real quickly. When sales come down, yes, naturally, you would expect that cash flow would improve because we\u2019re not \u2013 we don\u2019t need to hold capital associated with new business. So that the direction is, is as you described. John Nadel : Thank you. And Ken, I\u2019ve got one quick housekeeping one and this is in light of really no outlook for 2020 call, but any reason why your tax rate given the business mix, et cetera, should be any \u2013 it should be meaningfully different next year than it is this year. Ken Tanji : No. I think our tax rate has been very, very consistent. John Nadel : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Your line is open. Humphrey Lee : Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Looking at PGIM, the fee rate seems to be a little more pressure this quarter, especially in retail and general account assets. I was just wondering if you can talk about just kind of your overall fee rate expectation in the near-term and especially the fees of the assets that have left and versus those that came in. Steve Pelletier : Humphrey, it\u2019s Steve, I\u2019ll take your question. While Rob called out a specific fixed income institutional outflow this quarter, the general story throughout 2019 has been a pretty strong inflows into fixed income and some other asset classes, and a pressure on equity flows, so negative flows in the equity space. Really experienced across the industry as I would say, the active to passive headwinds picked up again this year. Given the relative fee rates across asset classes that migration of assets from asset mix from equities to fixed income has that impact that you noted on our average fee levels. Now I should emphasize we\u2019ve been able to significantly mitigate that by drawing a lot of our flows and including our fixed income flows into specific strategy \u2013 strategies that have a solid fee levels. But nonetheless, the cumulative impact is, as you as you pointed out. I would say though that this gradual migration of assets from equity to fixed income of asset mix from equity to fixed income, especially fueled by fixed income appreciation in recent quarters due to the declining interest rate environment. While that might be a source of pressure on fees, it\u2019s also highly supportive of margin in the business. Fixed \u2013 and we have scale economies throughout our asset management complex. But the fixed income businesses where those scale economies are most attractive and flows \u2013 increasing contribution of fixed income to our asset mix will be supportive of margin expansion in the business. Humphrey Lee : Got it. I appreciate the color. Just for clarification on the expenses in international. I think in response to Alex\u2019s question earlier, you talked about the $55 million in the fourth quarter in terms of the elevated expenses is kind of where you think would drop off. But I think from last quarter\u2019s call you talk about in Gibraltar, you expect some high expenses to continue throughout 2020. And then especially given, it seems like Gibraltar was a little bit lighter expenses in the third quarter. Should we still expect \u2013 elevated expenses in international throughout 2020 and then kind of coming off of that, so how should we think about that in general? Scott Sleyster : Hi, Humphrey, this is Scott. I\u2019ll take that. The $55 million really related to the Life Planner business, as you pointed out, we had a \u2013 we actually had a kind of overshot on what we thought our expenses might be in Gibraltar this quarter. We do still expect in Gibraltar a modest level of elevated expenses. I think where we guided you last quarter that would continue to about mid year. The really sizable amounts of that were picked up in 2019. So I\u2019d say those are relatively de minimis, and I think in the guidance on expenses that were given on the overnight we\u2019ve captured that bleed in. And I would say it\u2019s not really very significant in Gibraltar. Humphrey Lee : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Jimmy Bhullar : Hi. So first a question for Ken, on the interest rate impact, I\u2019m assuming that if you don\u2019t \u2013 if rates do not change then that at least for the next one or two or three years compounds at a much faster rate than your normal earnings growth, so it becomes a bigger and bigger headwind in 2021 versus what you\u2019ve outlined for potentially the next 12 months. Right? Ken Tanji : Yes, I think you should think of it as for \u2013 we said $0.30 for five quarters, call it $0.28 for four. And that\u2019s sort of the annual drag. Jimmy Bhullar : Yes. But then beyond that, it should be a considerably higher than the $0.28 in the next four quarters, just at the base that it\u2019s building up. Correct? Ken Tanji : Yes. Yes. That\u2019s the way the math works. And over time it dissipates. Jimmy Bhullar : Yes. But that\u2019s a few years out as you roll the portfolio over, assuming no change in rates again. Right? Ken Tanji : That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. Jimmy Bhullar : And then on your Japan sales at Prudential of Japan you \u2013 there\u2019s a tax law change, you withdrew a term product. Should we assume that at least in the near-term that sales will remain muted or, and if you could just give us color on what drove the weakness, that there\u2019s something besides that drove the weak sales this quarter and just some idea on sort of trends in that market and what your expectations are for sales? Scott Sleyster : Hi, Jimmy. This is Scott. Let me take that a couple of ways. One, the corporate tax law change did in fact impact everybody in the industry, but it touched us in both POJ and in the Life Planner business. So there was the national tax authority was reviewing the rules and there was a four or five month period where you didn\u2019t know what they were going to look like and then an implementation period after that. In the case of case of POJ, I would say the effect was more modest because of the clientele being business owners and high net worth and some of the products that are coming back. There we\u2019ll continue to sell some of the new corporate products. But more importantly, the Life Planner growth across our channel has been strong really across the board, so that that\u2019s favorable. I would say in the case of \u2013 in Gibraltar it\u2019s really a more significant challenge. We\u2019ve been seeing more competitive. We had the corporate product. We\u2019ve also continued to see pretty intense competition in the bank channel market. And we\u2019ve also imposed some pricing discipline where we\u2019ve favored kind of recurring premium, mortality-based products versus some of the more income oriented products as rates came down. So when you combine those three effects, I would say, in the case of Gibraltar, the issues are more challenging. In the case of POJ and Life Planner generally, they\u2019re more transitory in nature. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. And then just lastly, any comments on what\u2019s going on in the Chilean market, just with all the political instability and the potential for pension reform at some point? Scott Sleyster : Yes. A couple of comments. Our business there with Habitat actually has performed very, very well year-to-date and we actually had very, very favorable and [indiscernible] performance based on the underlying markets this quarter. That being said, I would say we\u2019ve been in touch fairly frequently with what\u2019s going on there, and I wouldn\u2019t really downplay what\u2019s going on there, it\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s relatively serious. I think the people there are concerned about the unrest. That being said, one of the \u2013 one of the responses and one of the request if you will, the demands that are out there and the factors impacting insecurity relates to people being nervous about old age retirement and so there is actually proposals to materially increase the deposits and then call it the generosity of some of the systems, we may or may not benefit that much from that because sometimes when they increase the deposits, they don\u2019t allow fees on them and what have you. But in general, I would say, I think it\u2019s a serious situation down there. That being said, we\u2019re actually quite well positioned and we\u2019re in a space in the market, where the demands of those that are feeling disadvantaged are looking for government actions that would be supportive of our sector. Ken Tanji : And also don\u2019t forget, we have the \u2013 we have the lowest fees and some of the best investment performance in the business and therefore within the pension sector, we\u2019re very well positioned as well. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of John Barnidge with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open. John Barnidge : Thanks. Another life insurer had a large write-down in the quarter on private equity position. Can you walk us through how many different private equity or venture capital positions you have, average investment size and largest on carrying value, please? Rob Falzon : John, it\u2019s Rob. In our \u2013 if you look at our alternatives portfolio, a couple of things to note, one is it\u2019s extraordinarily well diversified. There in excess of 2000 underlying companies invested through somewhere around 300 funds in that portfolio. So we do not have any particular concentration. To the extent that we have direct investments in companies in that portfolio, which come about as they do in these kinds of strategies by co-investment rights. They are primarily, if not exclusively in private equity, not in venture capital, and therefore tend to have significantly less volatility. And any of those underlying investments are relatively small. So, we obviously in the context of our alternatives portfolio, we have out in underperformance that\u2019s a reflection of markets and overall segment performance. We tend to have a little less of the idiosyncratic performance as a result of single investments. We\u2019re not entirely immune from it, but nothing to particularly call out there, well-diversified and relatively conservatively positioned. John Barnidge : Great. My follow-up, most of them have been answered, but are you seeing any signs of early activity in flu season? It seems like everyone here is sick earlier. Steve Pelletier : John, this is Steve. I\u2019ll answer your question. I think I don\u2019t know about the immediately present the state of the flu season, but I think that we did see in this quarter our life mortality in the individual life business have some experience that was a counter to what we normally see as the seasonal trends. Normally, the third quarter is a \u2013 tends to be a positive experience in life mortality. It didn\u2019t play out that way this quarter. We saw the unfavorable experience in this quarter in blocks that have really generally trended quite favorably over time. And as a result, we believe that this quarter\u2019s result is more of a random fluctuation rather than indicative of any underlying issues or trends. I would say also in relation to the third quarter mortality experience being different from normal seasonal patterns in life, we saw exact the similar phenomenon play out in the retirement business. A business that normally has in the third quarter less favorable reserve experience and in this quarter because of a similar mortality trends the business was able to realize outsized reserve gains, again, kind of pushing away from the normal seasonal patterns. And I think this speaks to our complimentary business mix working out as we\u2019ve intended to and as we\u2019ve designed it to. John Barnidge : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, so I recognize you guys aren\u2019t hosting an outlook call any more, but I guess is there a way that you can give us some kind of baseline EPS growth or maybe where you come in within your ROE band in 2022 just so we get a sense of kind of the forward days beyond just, I guess, thinking about some of the items you called out in the slides as well as, right, the higher corporate expenses that do recur every fourth quarter? Charlie Lowrey : Yes, sure. I\u2019ll just sort of echo some of the things that Rob mentioned earlier. And I sort of described how you can think about whether the baseline that we described coming out of the second quarter or our results for the third quarter adjusted for the things that were a bit favorable or the fourth quarter baseline we provided adjusted for the elevated level of expenses. All kind of gets you to an EPS number that\u2019s a little bit better than $3. And then, our businesses are growing. We articulated some of our growth thoughts at Investor Day. And now we do have a lower interest rate environment so that eats into that a little bit as we described and given sensitivities to. But then on top of that, we have the margin improvement that we have underway, which again, we\u2019ve articulated and given measures for as well as the impact of Assurance IQ acquisition, which we expect to be accretive in 2020. So I think those are all the components that we think about as we look to 2020 and would encourage you to think about for yourself. Rob Falzon : Elyse, it\u2019s Rob. Let me just sort of jump in on the ROE portion of your question. First, I\u2019d note that in the third quarter we had an ROE of \u2013 in excess of 13%. So, while we had headwinds associated with equity markets, we did have positive impacts \u2013 headwinds associated with interest rates. We had positive impacts with the movement in equity markets. And if you think about the little better than $3 quarterly baseline number that Ken triangulated around, that would still represent an ROE that would be about 13%. And so, when we provided our outlook of 12% to 14% ROE, it was obviously in an environment where interest rates were much higher. But the expectation was that absent those interest rates, we would be in the midpoint of that, 13% is the midpoint between 12% and 14% was more sort of a baseline expectation as opposed to the high-end of our range. With the headwind in interest rates, it could put a little bit of pressure on that, but I think that the statements we made with regard to that range of 12% to 14% have not changed materially by virtue of anything that\u2019s occurred since the point in time where we\u2019ve gave out that guidance, absent the recalibration for interest rates. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, thanks. And then in terms of Assurance, that deal is now closed. Is there anything in terms of modeling that you want to point out in terms of the seasonality as we put that into our models? I believe you guys had previously said it was more weighted towards the fourth quarter. Just anything that stands out as we think about getting that into 2020 on a quarterly basis? Andy Sullivan : Yes, sure. Elyse, this is Andy. I\u2019ll take your question and thank you for the question. There will be seasonal variability quarter-to-quarter and right now a good portion of the revenue is driven by the Medicare advantage product, and the individual age 65 products that are really driven by the open enrollment period. It\u2019s in the fourth quarter. So when you think about earnings pattern with the current mix of business that we have with Assurance and prior to us executing on adding additional products to the platform, the fourth quarter will likely be our heaviest from both the revenue and earnings perspective. Charlie Lowrey : Yes. But keep in mind, again, this is a young company and a growing company and we didn\u2019t expect it to be material to the fourth quarter. But we feel good about the progress we\u2019re making and the outlook for 2020 and 2021. Andy Sullivan : And maybe just two add-ons, obviously, in this fourth quarter we\u2019ll experience the transaction and transaction and financing costs. Also the core results are going to be net of the amortization of the intangible assets that are \u2013 that went on the books. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Charlie Lowrey for any closing comments. Charlie Lowrey : Thank you. So as you heard, we\u2019re committed to delivering on our purpose of providing financial opportunity to more people and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress in the months ahead. But before wrapping up, I\u2019d like to take a moment to recognize Steve Pelletier, who is retiring next month following an extraordinary 27-year career at the company. Thank you, Steve, for your many contributions to Prudential throughout your career. And for those of you who are not in the room here, but on the telephone, I wish you could see his grin, which is from ear to ear, as he participates in his last earnings call. And with that, I\u2019d like to thank you again for joining us today and we look forward to more conversations in the future. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Charlie. Charles Lowrey : Thank you, Darin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter earnings per share of $2.33. We also reported an adjusted operating return on equity of 12.1% for the full year. Looking back on 2019, we implemented a number of important actions to enhance our business and financial performance for the long-term. As a result, we have begun 2020 with a clear set of initiatives against which we will execute with a renewed confidence that our businesses can deliver increased earnings performance. I'll begin this morning by sharing a few accomplishments from 2019. First, we launched a process, talent and technology transformation initiative, which is on track to realize $500 million in run rate cost savings by 2022. As part of this program, we initiated a voluntary separation program for segments of our U.S. workforce during the fourth quarter, which is reducing our cost base over the course of 2020 and creating a more agile and competitive workforce. Second, we returned approximately $4 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. The 10% increase in our dividend represents the 12th consecutive year of dividend increases and produces a yield on book value in excess of 4%. Third, we completed our acquisition of Assurance IQ in October adding a leading direct-to-consumer financial wellness solutions platform. We're encouraged by the growth in customer demand, the interest from carriers wanting to put their products on the platform, and the level of talent we're attracting from well-known technology companies. Finally, we made progress in our ongoing efforts to reduce the variability of our quarterly earnings pattern and we added transparency to our quarterly financial performance. In 2019, our financial performance was impacted by a low interest rate environment, the annual assumption update in our individual life business and higher than typical expenses in our international businesses. In 2020, we are implementing a number of initiatives to drive improved financial performance in the years ahead. We're focused on executing three key initiatives. First, we remain focused on enhancing the customer experience to produce long-term sustainable growth while generating $140 million in cost savings this year. Second, in our international business we continue to focus on increasing the percentage of earnings coming from growth markets. Supporting this objective, this quarter we closed on the acquisition of a Colombian pension fund manager with Habitat, expanding our presence in Latin America. We also completed the sale of our Italian insurance business and are exploring strategic options for operations in other markets including Korea. We will share further details at the appropriate time. And third, we're continuing to take steps to mitigate the effects of the low interest rate environment, such as adjusting the mix and pricing of our products. Turning to Slide 3, I'll briefly touch upon some of the key drivers of our fourth quarter results which Rob will cover in more detail. Our U.S. businesses benefited from record account values in retirement and individual annuities. Earnings increased from the prior year quarter, reflecting higher net investment spread results, partly offset by lower fees in our annuities business. PGIM, our global asset manager, reported record assets under management of $1.3 trillion, as well as higher net asset management fees and other related revenues. Our international businesses increased earnings driven by higher net investment spread results and business growth, partly offset by higher than typical expenses. Turning to Slide 4, I'd like to touch briefly on four ways we generate value to our stakeholders in a sustainable way. First, we are a purpose driven company. We strive to make lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world and do so for a broad array of stakeholders. Second, in December our Board introduced a multi-stakeholder framework that extends the Board's accountability to investors, employees, customers, and society at large, reinforcing the Board's commitment and ours to enabling positive change as well as strong financial returns. Third, this multi-stakeholder framework is reflected in our continued pursuit of exemplary environmental, social and governance practices. Finally, we provide transparency, so investors can measure our progress. We disclose metrics and targets related to the financial stability Board's task force on climate-related financial disclosures. This includes quantifying greenhouse gas emissions, recycling and water usage. In addition, we publish metrics in accordance with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board. We continue to be recognized for our commitment and standards we uphold. Just last month, Fortune included us on its list of World's Most Admired Companies for the fifth consecutive year. We are proud to have earned the first place distinction in the Life and Health Insurance Category each year. In closing, we continue to move quickly and with conviction to execute on our strategy that we put into place, including the three initiatives I have outlined for 2020. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our business performance for the quarter and our earnings outlook. Robert Falzon : Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide more color on how we are executing on our strategy within our U.S. PGIM and international businesses and in our near-term earnings growth outlook. Turning to Slide 5, our U.S. businesses consist of the workplace solutions, individual solutions, and Assurance IQ divisions that produce a diversified source of earnings from these investment spread and underwriting income. Our U.S. businesses have three key priorities for growth. First, we are investing in transforming our capabilities and the way we work to deliver a better customer experience while realizing efficiencies that will improve our margins. Second, we will continue to pursue targeted growth opportunities, including by way of example, the non-jumbo corporate segment of the full-service retirement market and the Premier segment of involuntary products offered by our group insurance business. And third, we remain committed to expanding our addressable market, including through workplace financial wellness and Assurance IQ. As a result of the continued thoughtful execution of these priorities, over time we expect higher earnings growth and improved returns. In the near-term we expect underlying earnings in the U.S. businesses to be relatively consistent with current levels, as underlying business growth in retirement, group insurance and Assurance IQ offset the impact from low interest rates and the net outflows in our individual annuities business as we maintain pricing discipline. We have included a slide in the appendix that provides our expected underlying earnings outlook by business. Now, turning to Slide 6, PGIM asset management business continues to leverage its diversified multi-manager model, global distribution in affiliated flows to grow in higher value-added strategies that serve investors globally. With a record $1.3 trillion of assets under management as of year-end, PGIM is a top 10 global asset manager. It is the fifth largest investor in fixed-income globally and one of the largest in alternative investments with significant real estate and private investor platforms. We continue to broaden and globalize our products and capabilities by developing and launching private and alternative investment strategies, and expanding in both retail and international markets. And as the investment engine of Prudential, PGIM benefits from a symbiotic relationship with our U.S. and international businesses. Our investment performance is a key driver of our business success. More than 80% of assets under management have outperformed their benchmarks over the last 3, 5, and 10-year periods. This performance helped us to generate $1.9 billion of net third-party flows during the fourth quarter, including $1.2 billion of institutional and $700 million of retail net flows. In addition, PGIM rose to the seventh highest ranking mutual fund franchise based on 2019 net flows, up from 14th in 2018. PGIM's adjusted operating margin of 32% in the fourth quarter was 180 basis points higher than the year ago quarter and has grown over the last three years as we balance business reinvestment with margin expansion. For the full year 2019, PGIM had a record level of adjusted operating income that was 4% higher than 2018 and 6% higher after adjusting for business acquisition related costs. Looking ahead, we believe PGIM is well positioned to deliver mid to high single-digit earnings growth across the cycle driven by its deep asset class expertise while leveraging its scale and reach as a global asset manager. And we expect to grow earnings in 2020 despite the absence of the Wells Fargo fee arrangement that ended last year. Turning to Slide 7, our international businesses continued to benefit from our world-class Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated business model with unique distribution, as well as from our focus on other operations in high-growth markets. Life Planner sales increased by 17% compared to the year ago quarter. This increase was driven by record Life Planner count and higher sales in Brazil, Korea and Taiwan. Sales for Gibraltar were 14% lower than the year ago quarter. This primarily reflects lower single pay U.S. dollar fixed annuity sales in our Life Consultant and Independent Agency channels, as the recent decline in U.S. interest rates led us to lower credit rates. In addition, we continue to focus on quality distribution. The number of Life Planner as a result has declined. The lower Life Consultant sales were partially offset by higher bank channel sales. We continue to innovate new products and implement pricing actions to maintain both sales and our targeted level of profitability. Total inforce for international increased by 3% from the prior year, including a 5% increase in Life Planner and a 1% increase in Gibraltar. In the near-term we expect total inforce to grow at a similar level. We expect underlying earnings to be relatively consistent with current levels as business growth will offset the impact of low interest rates. And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken. Ken Tanji : Thanks, Rob. I'll begin on Slide 8 which provides insight into the earnings for first quarter 2020 relative to our fourth quarter 2019 results. We begin with pretax adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter which was $1.2 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.33 on an after-tax basis. Then we adjust for the following items. First, in the fourth quarter we had favorable variable investment income driven by equity market performance and prepayment income which was a benefit of $135 million. Second, the first quarter is expected to have lower seasonal expenses and implementation costs, which will result in a net benefit of $435 million or $0.85 per share and is comprised of two items. The fourth quarter included $160 million of seasonally higher expenses and $365 million of implementation costs including the impact from the voluntary separation program. As indicated in the 8-K filing on December 17, we expect implementation costs of $175 million in 2020 with about 20 million of these costs in the first quarter. And long-term compensation expense for retiree eligible employees is recognized when awards are granted, which is typically in the first quarter of each year. In the first quarter of 2020 we expect this expense to be about $70 million split between PGIM and corporate and other. These items net to $0.85 per share. Third, there are other considerations that we expect will have a $20 million more favorable impact in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter. And fourth, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by $10 million assuming reinvestment rates are held flat with the fourth-quarter. Combined, this gets us to a baseline of $2.95 per share for the first quarter of 2020 before including the impact of share repurchases, business growth, and market impacts in 2020. The baseline also includes items specific to the first quarter that reduces EPS by approximately $0.15 per share. While we have provided these items to consider, there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the first quarter of 2020. I'd also like to bring your attention to a few additional items that are included in the appendix. On Slide 18 we have provided additional information that shows the adjusted operating income roll forward by business. And on Slide 19 we've provided updated information regarding seasonal items by business. In addition, we have included some other considerations for 2020 on Slide 21 regarding corporate and other net costs, the yen foreign exchange rate, and the effective tax rate. Now turning to Slide 9, I'll provide an update on capital deployment, liquidity and leverage. We feel very good about the overall strength of our capital position. We've returned $900 million to shareholders during the fourth quarter through dividends and share repurchases, which were largely funded by the cash flows generated by our businesses. On December 19, we announced the Board's authorization for the repurchase of the 2 billion of common stock in 2020. In addition, we increased the first quarter dividend to $1.10 per share which represents a 10% increase from our dividend in the fourth quarter of 2019 and a 4.4% yield on our adjusted book value. We also continue to maintain a rock solid balance sheet. Our regulatory capital ratios continued to be above our AA financial strength targets and our financial leverage ratio remains better than our target. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company were $4.1 billion at the end of the quarter and at the midpoint of our $3 billion $5 billion liquidity target range. We will continue to invest in the growth of our businesses, assess acquisition opportunities to build scale or gain capabilities, and return capital to shareholders. Turning to Slide 10 and in summary, we had numerous accomplishments in 2019. We are focused on executing our key initiatives in 2020 leading to greater earnings in 2021. Now, I'll turn it to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nigel Dally from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Nigel Dally : Great, thanks, and good morning. I had a question on annuities, is one of the areas that you do expect a decline in earnings in 2020, so I just wanted to check, is that just because of a modest decline in AUM because the anticipated outflows of evolving [indiscernible] depreciation or is there also an underlying element of some deterioration in the return on assets, and if it is the latter what's driving that/ Andy Sullivan : So Nigel, thanks for your question. This is Andy. There's really two major impacts that we're seeing in the annuities business. one, as you pointed out is the outflow. That really is coming from we're being very disciplined in our pricing of product and in our return on new sales. And if you look back where we had some pretty sizable blocks back in the 2010 to 2012 range, so that's creating that outflow. The other thing I would point to though is, as that business is rolling across it surrender period, we are seeing business go to lower fee tiers and getting fee pressure from that effect. Ken Tanji : Yes Nigel, this is Ken. I'll just add, you know I know there has been some questions about the ROA. You know, our primary objective with the profitability of our annuity business is to achieve a high ROE and our variable annuity business is very profitable and that is evident by the higher ROE that is in the high teens and that high ROE reflects your unique product design, our robust risk management, and disciplined pricing. And our hedging program is highly effective and it results in very stable earnings capital and cash flow even with significant market moves. So as a result, our earnings capital and cash flow will be less sensitive to markets than the account values and ROA may move as market moves, but our - again our earnings capital and cash flow will be stable and ROA is simply an outcome. Though the decline in rates and the increase in equity markets, while it had an increase in account values, had a less meaningful impact on our earnings, again due to our robust risk management. Nigel Dally : Okay, I got it. Second question which is on dividends, good to see the incremental dividends again this quarter and I think that brings the payout ratio to around 35%. So the limit to how high you'd like to go or is there incremental upside there? Ken Tanji : Yes, sur. So maybe just a little bit of reflection of our capital management and shareholder distribution philosophy that's been very consistent over time and it starts with our free cash flow, which is about 65% of after-tax earnings, this year a little bit better than that. And this we then distribute in both the forms of dividends and share repurchases. Our dividends have increased actually 12 years in a row now and if you looked at the average increased over the last five years, it's been 11%. And now that dividend represents as I mentioned in my opening comments of 4.4% yield on book value. Our board has also authorized 2 billion of share repurchases for 2020. So generally a very consistent approach to our shareholder distributions which balances both dividends and returns of excess capital through share repurchases. Nigel Dally : Very helpful, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Andrew Kligerman : Hey, good morning. So maybe a question on interest rates, on last quarter's call you increased your guided interest rate sensitivity to $0.30 of EPS impacts for 50 basis point drop in rates and now we've seen in 2020, well maybe not today, but I would just maybe 30 basis points so far in 2020. So I just want to make sure there are no changes. Should we expect $0.15 to $0.20 negative impact on 2020 EPS based on that or are there some other factors there and with that maybe you could tell us what your new money yields are [indiscernible] portfolio? Ken Tanji : Yes, sure. So the sensitivity that we gave to interest rates of 50 basis points at $0.30 that's still good. So that rough rule of thumb and do you apply it I think that still is appropriate. Our new money yields in the second half of the year were about 3.65% and you can think of that relative to our \u2013 and that's in the U.S. relative to our U.S. portfolio yield of about 4.2%. Andrew Kligerman : Hey, thank you. And then just shifting over to the Individual Life segment I'm trying to thinking back second quarter you had that $200 million plus charge, the third quarter that was about $30 million of underwriting income below expectations and the 4Q is about $15 million now below expectations. So I'm wondering as we look forward, are you comfortable with underwriting assumptions into the year and your sales were really robust at $209 million you cited and is a record since 2013. So what are you selling that you are excited about? Andy Sullivan : Yes, so Andrew it's Andy, thanks for your question. So we would consider our actions are expected in the fourth quarter as in line with our expectations, the results was 103% and I would encourage you to think of \u2013 there was a quarter around that 100 plus or minus a couple of percent. So that \u2013 we really that's in line. As far as you referenced the assumption of dates, we're seeing that our business performance has been consistent with the updates that we made in the second quarter. Shifting over to the new business sales, we are very, very, pleased with the performance of sales in the Individual Life business as you cited it. Best quarter in five years. We're probably even more pleased that reverses the absolute level in the mix of sales. The mix has shifted pretty meaningfully away from guaranteed Universal Life which obviously is highly interest rate sensitive and over to where almost half of the sales are variable life which has much, much less sensitivity changes rates. So, I'm pleased with what we're seeing. The success is really coming from, we have a very, very strong brand name. We believe our product portfolio is very strong and our distribution system is top notch. Andrew Kligerman : And then in term Life is at the balance of the sales margin? Andy Sullivan : Yes, awesome. Andrew Kligerman : Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Thomas Gallagher : Good morning. Just a first question on the Assurance IQ deal in terms of how were you thinking about the results so far. It looks to me based on the disclosure that the revenues are coming bin below what was projected initially I think it was \u20ac500 million was the 2019 guide and looks closer to maybe \u20ac300 million on a full year basis. I guess, the first question is, is that right? And secondly, does that cause you to rethink revenue and earnings projections 2020, 2021? Andy Sullivan : So maybe, Tom, this is Andy. I'll start and then I'll had it off to ken. So as you would imagine these are early days to just closed the acquisition in October, but I'll tell you there is a lot of things that we're excited about. We are \u2013 as we sit here today even more excited about the strategic growth potential of this business? You know, in the fourth quarter we saw very, very strong consumer demand flow across the platform. We saw 6.5 million shoppers and just to define that for you. We define a shopper as an individual that has an absolute to buy a financial service product and that is willing to share their contact information with us. So we saw 6.5 million shoppers across the platform in 4Q. That is compared against 3.5 million in the year ago quarter, so we're very pleased with the level of consumer flow and consumer demand. A very positive for us on that is we have product providers literally lining of every shape and size that want to go ahead and get on the platform. So, from a revenue potential perspective, we - are strong as we were. We are in \u2013 kind of where we're focused right now is getting those additional products on to the platform. As far as your number is around revenue, yes, our revenue for the year came in just North of $300 million, and really what I would tell you there is, we had a lot more consumer demand than we had appointed agents, call it capacity on the platform and we learned some lessons in the quarter around the effort and energy and time line it takes to get the Medicare Advantage and under 65 healthcare agents on to the platform. I will tell you that we are already well underway in getting those agents appointed for 4Q of 2020. Now that's a completely rectifiable situation and we are well out in front of it. Ken Tanji : The only thing I'd add there is, as you heard from Andy describe, this business is in a very high growth phase and we were not expecting meaningful earnings in the near term or in 2020 as a result. And so, it is early days and we will report this information to you each quarter and just as Andy indicated, just a reminder that is a seasonal business primarily fourth quarter loaded. Thomas Gallagher : Got it and Ken would you say you are sticking to the $700 million revenue projection for 2020 still or is that sort of TB [ph] day? A \u2013 Ken Tanji : Yes well, okay now, given the high growth nature of this business, we don't want to get into the practice of updating each and every quarter. So again, you are going to see the results as they occur in a separate segment. Tom Gallagher : Okay, thanks. And then just my follow up is, is PRU planning on early adopting variable annuity reform at year-end 2019, and if not - is the plan to do full implementation in 2020 or three year phase and\u2026 A \u2013 Andy Sullivan : We're going to adopt on the effective date, which is January 01, 2020. But it reminds you that, we made big structural changes that were very much aligned with the new reform many years ago. So we're well positioned and expect to be very well capitalized before the reform and after the reform. Tom Gallagher : Okay, and Ken, no three year phase and you'd fully adopt in 2020. A \u2013 Ken Tanji : Only adopt January 1st. Tom Gallagher : Okay, thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Next, we'll go to the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Erik Bass : Hi, thank you. So you've clearly taken two big steps to accelerate the timing of realizing the expense savings you've talked about. Can you just help us think about when we'll start to see these end results and where they'll come through, it\u2019s whether in terms of the business segments or through in corporate? A \u2013 Andy Sullivan : Yes, sure, our 8-K that we filed, we gave some information of our belief of the progression of the saves. They were modest in 2019. And we provided an estimate for 2020. That $140 million would be realized in the P&L in the year. Those results you can expect to build as we go through the year. And you can expect to see them emerge with primarily in the U.S. businesses and in corporate, but throughout those businesses, but again, because it's a company, it's a U.S. business wide program. Erik Bass : Got it. And when you're giving sort of your walkthrough in the slides of kind of future earnings trajectory, am I right that there's nothing really explicitly contemplated there from savings in the businesses? A \u2013 Andy Sullivan : Only what was accomplished through 2019 or the first or the fourth quarter, and then any future improvement, whether it's from business growth or share repurchases or additional expenses, incremental expenses would not be included in that baseline. That's all in the future. Erik Bass : Got it. And then you mentioned in the remarks, potential actions to continue streamlining your business portfolio. And realized it's premature to say much specific, but how would you think of redeploying any proceeds, you potentially generate. Would you look to reinvest these in the businesses or potentially would they be available to return to shareholders? Charles Lowrey : The answer is yes. So what we mean is what we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. But let me take a step back for a moment and make a more general comment on how we think about capital in particular, the optimization of our capital, which I think we've been doing for years. So we always look across our businesses both domestically and internationally to ensure that we're optimizing capital deployment. And when we see attractive opportunities, you've seen us invest in growth and make acquisitions. And you've also seen us scale back our liquid divestitures over the years when they are better uses of capital. And then put that capital to use either in growing the franchise or if there aren't opportunities, returning it to shareholders. So we'll continue to look for ways to optimize capital deployment and to maximize outcomes for our shareholders, whether that be in investing in new business opportunities which again, you've seen us do or return capital to shareholders. Erik Bass : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead. Ryan Krueger : Hi, good morning. I guess first have you completed the yearend cash flow testing analysis and if so, can you give us any indication of the impact? Ken Tanji : Yes, the statutory filings will come out at the end of the month. And so yes, that will include our updated cash flow testing or acid adequacy testing. You'll see those results when we report them. What I offer you now is, given lower rates, we would expect some strengthening in our ATT reserves or cash flow testing. But we have derivative games or interest rate hedges that offset that and we expect to have RBC ratios that are above our AA financial strength objectives. Ryan Krueger : Got it, thanks. And then when you did the second quarter assumption review, and had some impacts to the individual life business, at the time, you talked about reinsurance as being a potential option to improve returns in that business. That's something that you're still contemplating and can you give us any update there? Andy Sullivan : Yes, Ryan this is Andy. So I would broaden your question and say we're taking a number of actions to strengthen the performance of our life business. First and foremost, we are working diligently on expense efficiencies. And you can think about that in the context of the broader work going on at the company and the \u20ac500 million in outcomes we expect over the next couple years. We already talked about the sales, which we think is a meaningful \u2013 will be a meaningful contributor to giving earnings left over time in the business. And then yes, you are correct. We have been looking at options and we'll continue to look at options from a reinsurance perspective \u2013 with the block. And what we're looking for there, obviously is the right partner, and the right terms that make economic sense for us. There's nothing currently that we want to report, but we'll keep you posted as we go forward. Ryan Krueger : All right, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Citi. Please go ahead. Suneet Kamath : Thanks. Just focusing on Slide 20 of your deck in the international businesses, it looks like at least over the next 12 months Life Planner and Gibraltar are expected to be flat, which is, lower than that intermediate earnings growth guidance, you gave at Investor Day of mid single digits. So just want to get a sense of if we stay in this interest rate environment, what kind of gets us from flat back up to the mid single digits and sort of over what timeframe? Scott Sleyster : Hi Suneet, this is Scott. Let me take that. So as we pointed out, the underlying business fundamentals for our international businesses actually look quite strong. As Rob pointed out, our reinforced block is growing at about 4%, four to five in LP and about 1% in Gibraltar. Unfortunately, given the low rate environment, for the most part, we're giving back a lot of the earnings growth associated in the block and we're continuing to make some portfolio in investments on technology and the like. So right now, I would say over the, certainly looking out to this year, we think we're going to be closer to flat. We hope over time as we make adjustments that will start to build. But I would say even right now, looking at the intermediate term, we'd say we're looking at low single digit growth. Suneet Kamath : Okay, thanks. And then a follow up is just on Assurance IQ. I think it was mentioned that there are about 6.5 million shoppers in the fourth quarter, what should we expect to be the conversion rate of that balance? In other words of the 6.5 million how many would you expect to actually buy a product? Andy Sullivan : So, Suneet it\u2019s Andy, I'll take your question. Conversion rate is a very complex topic. So it very much depends on the product mix that's on the platform. And as we talked about, we are in a phase of rapidly looking out \u2013 looking to roll new products onto the platform. So the conversion rates that we're currently experiencing are going to change quite a bit with that product mix shift, as well as, as you can imagine, with the shopper demand we had, but the mismatch with our agent capacity, our conversion was lower than we would expect going forward. At this point, we're not going to put out explicit numbers, but hopefully that gives you a way to think about it. Suneet Kamath : And have you put any PRU products on that platform yet? I know that was one of your objectives when you announced the deal. Andy Sullivan : Yes, so it absolutely is one of our primary objectives. We have been working diligently to get our simply Term Life product onto the platform. We are ahead of schedule on those plans and we will get that product on the platform in the second quarter of this year. And we're very encouraged with our brand name and the quality of our products that that will give both Assurance and obviously, Mother Prudential some lift. Suneet Kamath : Okay, thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Next, we'll go to the line of John Barnidge from Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead. John Barnidge : Thank you. Have you seen any meaningful acceleration in PGIM\u2019s UK business post election or demand for products from that market in continental Europe? Andy Sullivan : So, John, this is Andy, I'll take that question. So what I would tell you is in the short term, with all the flux that's been going on, we haven't seen any meaningful change or lift. I would kind of frame it as, in many ways the marketplace is a bit hunkered down. So as an example, on the real estate side, we haven't seen a whole lot of capital fundraising and deployment. We are absolutely ready. No matter how that plays out we have licenses in all the right places and people in all the right places to continue not only serving our current clients, but to capitalize on potential opportunities if and when the dust settles. John Barnidge : Okay, and then my followup, as we look back to SARS over 15 years ago in light of the coronavirus, do you see any increased demand for your products on the benefit side to note? Scott Sleyster : Hi, this is Scott again. On the specific question, I would say history would show that any time there is a widespread illness, it creates a greater sensitivity among the customer base about the kinds of products that we sell. In particular, as you know on the international side, especially, we're very focused on death protection products. And so, anytime you have something like this that goes on, you're very concerned about your employees and your customers and you're taking lots of actions there. But I do think there is a follow on effect of greater sensitivity to the products that we offer. John Barnidge : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead. Humphrey Lee : Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. A question related to PGIM, so looking at your retail flows it looks very strong from an inflows perspective. I think it maybe even a record number. But then at the same time it seems like you have record withdrawals as well. I was just wondering if you can provide some color in terms of where you see the inflows and what happened in the outflows and how do you think about in 2020? Andy Sullivan : So yes, this is Andy, Humphrey. So, we are very pleased and proud of the retail flows that we saw as I think Rob mentioned in his opening. We moved up to number seven in the quarter. The retail flows are really coming from an expansion of our product portfolio on that platform, as well as the work that we've done around usage. From an outflow perspective, what I would say is that will tend to be episodic. And I think over the long term, we feel very, very good that due to our investment performance and our range of strategies that we will see a continued upward trend over time. Charles Lowrey : And I'm pretty, I would just add on the institutional side that, those flows can be a little bit lumpy. And we saw a couple of clients who wanted to consolidate this year, and sometimes we're the beneficiary of consolidation, sometimes we're not and a couple of dominoes, tilted against us this year. But that doesn't affect how we think about our institutional capability or the quality of flows that we can have going forward. Humphrey Lee : That makes sense. And then just a clarification regarding Assurance IQ. So I think Ken was talking about the - given the growth that you\u2019re expecting and then you're not necessarily expecting any earnings from Assurance IQ in 2020. I just want to make sure that I heard that correctly because I think originally at the time of the announcement, you were expecting maybe $0.10 EPS accretion for 2020. So I just wanted to kind of bridge the indifferences. Ken Tanji : Yes, no, I didn't mean to say no earnings. I said not meaningful earnings, again, because of the high growth nature of the phase that they're going through. Humphrey Lee : So the $0.10 is still kind of, I understand you're not going to update guidance or anything like that, but is the $0.10 still a reasonable expectation? Ken Tanji : Again, we don't want to get in the practice of having to update this every quarter. Humphrey Lee : Okay. All right, fair enough. Thank you. Operator : And I'd now like to turn the call back to Charlie Lowrey for any closing comments. Charles Lowrey : Okay, thank you very much. So in closing, I hope you all walk away from this call with a clear picture of our progress and priorities, our continued sense of conviction and urgency and our path forward to deliver meaningful outcomes for all of our stakeholders including investors. So thanks again for joining us today and have a nice day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconferencing. You may now disconnect.",

Representing Prudential on today\u2019s call are Charlie Lowrey, Chairman and CEO; Rob Falzon, Vice Chairman; Andy Sullivan, Head of U.S. Businesses; Scott Sleyster, Head of International Businesses; Ken Tanji, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by Charlie, Rob and Ken, and then we will take your questions. Today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of such measures to the comparable GAAP measures and the discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, please see the slide titled Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures in the appendix to today\u2019s presentation, which can be found on our website at investor.prudential.com. Also, due to circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have decided to cancel our Tokyo Investor Day that was scheduled for September. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Charlie. Charlie Lowrey : Thank you, Darin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I would like to start this morning by recognizing the extraordinary circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic and by expressing our gratitude to all of those on the front lines who are fighting this crisis around the world. For those individuals and their families directly affected by the pandemic and particularly those who have lost loved ones, we extend our deepest sympathies. At Prudential, we're guided by our purpose : to make lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world and that includes being there for our employees, our customers and our communities, especially in times like these. We are completely focused on ensuring that we take the right course of action for the business, mitigating the impact of COVID-19, while investing for the future in order to emerge from this crisis stronger from this crisis stronger than before. The strength of our balance sheet enables us to manage our business for the long-term growth, while dealing with short-term business realities. Before we get into the first quarter performance, I'll cover some of the key steps we have taken as a company to support our employees, customers and communities in response to COVID-19. First, turning to slide 3. Ensuring the health and well-being of our employees and their families is our top priority. As the pandemic emerged, we initiated new policies and actions to ensure their safety and security, including additional family care support. This included implementing a wide-scale remote work environment, with approximately 98% of our employees and most of our international employees not working remotely. I\u2019m pleased to report that all our businesses and operational functions continue to run smoothly. Prioritizing the well-being of our employees enables us to address the evolving health and financial needs of our customers as the pandemic and its economic impact reverberate more broadly. We've also provided customers with assistance, such as premium deferrals and fee waivers as well as enhanced digital tools. I'm also incredibly proud of the work our employees have done to support our local communities, including in Newark, El Paso, Hartford and multiple international locations. These efforts include the donation of more than 150,000 face masks, including 75,000 N95 respirators for health care workers in New Jersey. In addition, the American Nurses Association and Prudential recently entered into an agreement for Prudential to sponsor ANA events and outreach initiatives in 2020. This agreement will include offering Prudential's financial wellness services and solutions to ANA members and the broader nursing community. We're pleased to be of assistance to those serving on the front lines of this pandemic. Turning to our financial strength. On Slide 4, our rock-solid balance sheet provides the foundation for our employees to serve our customers and our communities. We're confident in our ability to successfully manage in this environment in large part due to the robust, operational and financial risk framework that we put into place after the Great Recession of 2008. This framework prepared us with a playbook to address multiple stress scenarios, including pandemics and economic conditions that are more severe than what we are currently experiencing. In addition, we benefit from our recurring revenue model and mix of complementary businesses, which offset risk and produce capital benefits, giving us confidence about Prudential to navigate the current environment. We began 2020 with a strong capital and liquidity position, and our capital ended the quarter exceeding AA financial strength levels. As the pandemic unfolded and in light of uncertainty in the in the global markets, we executed our playbook. We successfully issued $1.5 billion of senior debt in early March, while spreads were still attractive. This included a $500 million green bond issuance, the first of its kind for a U.S. company in our sector. These actions pre-funded our opportunities through the end of 2021 and enhance the liquidity of our businesses. As part of the playbook, we further enhanced liquidity of our businesses and also paused share repurchases at the end of the first quarter to see how the economic environment develops. During the quarter, our variable annuity hedging performed extremely well with a 99% effective rate. Our approach to hedging the economic risk resulted in significant gains on our equity market and interest rate hedges to offset the increased liability. We feel comfortable about our ability to manage equity market fluctuations and continued low interest rates over time. We're also highly confident about the quality of our investment portfolio, which Rob will cover in more detail shortly. The strength of our financial position means our dividends to shareholders remain well covered by our income and free cash flow. Turning to Slide 5. We are on track to accomplish our strategic initiatives for the year and, in fact, are accelerating their execution in some cases. First, we are repricing our products more quickly and pivoting towards lower risk and less capital-intensive products. Second, with respect to rotating our international earnings mix to higher-growth markets, in April, we reached an agreement to sell our Prudential of Korea business. We also continue to pursue strategic alternatives for our Taiwan business. Finally, we continue to make progress on achieving our goal of $500 million in cost savings, $140 million of which should be achieved this year. We realized $30 million in the first quarter through actions we completed before the start of 2020. Turning to slide 6. While it seems like a light time ago, I'd like to spend a moment on our first quarter performance. We reported pre-tax adjusted operating income of $1.2 billion or $2.32 per share. The GAAP net loss was $0.70 per share, driven largely by non-economic factors. Our U.S. and international business earned lower variable investment income in the quarter. We also generated lower underwriting income in our U.S. businesses. Higher asset management fees at PGIM were offset by lower other related revenues. While the severity and duration of the pandemic and related economic impact remains unknown, we are confident about the strength of our company. Prudential has survived pandemics, wars, recessions and the depression, among other events in its 145-year history. We are resilient, we are strong and we will continue to move forward to deliver sustainable value for all our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a detailed look at our business performance for the quarter. Rob Falzon : Thank you, Charlie. As Charlie indicated, the results from our businesses in the first quarter were negatively impacted by two significant factors that we had not anticipated : adverse mortality and the impact of the pandemic, particularly on equity markets, interest rates and credit spreads. Adverse market conditions resulted in $150 million of lower variable investment income in our U.S. and international businesses and also reduced other related revenues in PGIM by $55 million, and the Chilean and Kaha earnings in our international business by $30 million. Overall mortality was $60 million above our seasonal expectation. We are continuing to work toward improving the profitability of our individual life business. We have strong life insurance, marketing and distribution capabilities, which we've expanded with the acquisition of Assurance IQ. In aggregate, these factors reduced first quarter's adjusted operating income by about $295 million or $0.58 a share. Lower interest rates and equity markets also challenged fundamentals across our businesses, and we are actively executing pricing and product actions to shift our business mix to less market-sensitive customer solutions. With that in mind, I'll turn now to providing more color on how we are executing on our strategy within our U.S., PGIM and international businesses as well as on the outlook for these businesses considering current market conditions. I will also provide an overview of our investment portfolio, given the increased focus on the risks associated with the potential near-term credit cycle. Turning to slide 7. Our U.S. businesses consist of the workplace solutions, individual solutions and Assurance IQ division that produce a diversified source of earnings from fees, investment spread and underwriting income. Our U.S. businesses continue to execute on three key priorities. First and foremost, the financial strength of these businesses, which continues to be solid despite the impacts of COVID-19 and the broader economic conditions. Continue to take product actions, including steps to diversify our mix of business and maintain profitability. Second, as the needs of our customers rapidly evolve, including in response to COVID-19 and its economic impact, we are leveraging our ongoing technology transformation and digital capabilities to enhance customer engagement. For example, within a matter of days in March, we introduced our fast track automated underwriting process for COVID-19 related claims with expanded e-capabilities for proof of death. Just weekend, we introduced new mobile apps and chat bots to help manage a surge in customer calls and inquiries. And we have expanded the use of electronic signatures across our businesses. We will continue to invest in transforming our capabilities by accelerating use of technology to deliver a better customer experience and enhance the speed at which we operate. And third, we remain committed to expanding our addressable market. The pandemic has amplified the financial wellness challenges that many US households face. To support our clients in these challenging times, we continue to invest in and expand our range of capabilities to meet their needs. For example, we completely transformed our flagship financial wellness offering pathways from an on-site to a virtual offering. In a matter of just weeks, we scheduled over 150 live web-based financial education seminars for our clients. And we introduced a new solution to help customers managed debt in partnership with GreenPath. We're also shifting our focus to serving an expanded addressable market with lower risk and less market sensitive solutions to address the changing market conditions. For example, in our individual annuities business, we're pivoting to less interest rate sensitive products, including accelerating to May of this year for launch of our FlexGuard indexed annuity. In our individual life business, we're also making product and pricing changes that will result in the continued pivot to variable life and other less interest rate-sensitive products. As a result of pricing actions, product pivots and the disruptions from COVID-19, we expect sales to continue to decline for individual annuities in the near term, and we also expect reduced sales for individual life. In our retirement business, while the longevity reinsurance market remains active, we expect that current market conditions will impact the funding levels of pension plans and, therefore, result in lower pension risk transfer transactions. Now turning to slide 8. PGIM is a top 10 global investment manager with $1.3 trillion of assets under management and continues to leverage its diversified multi-manager model to serve investors. Our robust infrastructure and investments in technology have allowed employees to seamlessly transition to working from home. This operational flexibility has allowed us to support clients with portfolio information and insights and address their questions even as we work in a virtual environment. While significant market fluctuations in the month of March affected our three-year performance, PGIM's long-term track record remains strong. 79% of assets under management have outperformed their benchmarks over the last five years and 94% over the last 10 years, and we have seen some recovery of performance and our short-term track record in April. Despite clients temporarily rebalancing into cash, we generated $2.9 billion of net third party flows during the first quarter. This reflects the resiliency of PGIM's diversified platform across asset classes, regions and client segments. Net flows included $4.2 billion of institutional inflows, partially offset by $1.3 billion of retail outflows. Fixed income experienced both retail and institutional inflows, and of note PGIM was the highest ranking US mutual fund franchise across active and passive asset managers based on net sales in the quarter. PGIM's asset management fees were up 8% compared to the year ago quarter driven by growth in average assets under management and a stable fee rate. Other related revenues decline primarily due to the effect of mark-to-market losses from credit spread widening in the first quarter. We expect near-term sales across the industry to be impacted by volatile public market conditions, reduced transaction volume in private asset classes and a slowdown in client activity. Despite this, we expect PGIM to emerge well-positioned vis-\u00e0-vis our competitors, driven by its diversified global platform. Turning to slide 9. Our international businesses include our Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other operations focused on high-growth markets. Life planner sales decreased 5% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by lower corporate product sales following the Japan tax law change, partially offset by replacement U.S. dollar protection products. Life planner headcount, however, reached a record level, increasing 5% compared to a year ago. Sales for Gibraltar were also 5% lower, primarily reflecting the continued trend of lower single-pay U.S. dollar fixed annuity sales in our life consultant and independent agency channels. In addition, as we continue to focus on quality distribution, the number of life consultants has declined. In Chile, we are the leading pension provider via our joint venture with Habitat. We earn fees on assets and realized mark-to-market gains or losses on the capital that we are required to invest in the funds. Our investment performance has outperformed over time as well as in the fourth quarter -- in the first quarter. Returns in the quarter, however, were down across the industry, and that contributed to approximately $30 million of lower than expected operating income.  As we look to the second quarter, we expect international sales to decrease significantly, reflecting the effect of social distancing protocols that limit in-person engagement with customers across our distribution channels. This will also affect recruiting of new life planners and life consultants. We're actively taking measures, including appropriate sales support to protect and care for our captive distribution during this difficult time. Over the longer term, we believe COVID-19 may result in heightened interest in Protection products, particularly the death protection products throughout the core of our needs-based selling approach. With respect to the current interest rate environment, we have successfully managed through decades of low interest rates and other market challenges in Japan. As you've seen in the past, we adjust to meet the needs and preferences of our customers while also achieving our return expectation. We have already taken actions and will continue to do so as needed as we moved forward. Also, as Charlie stated, in April, we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement to sell Prudential of Korea. This business represented less than 10% of international business sales. Now turning to our investment portfolio on slide 10. We have a conservative, quality focused approach to our investment portfolio, construction and management reflects our robust asset liability management practices, commitment to broad diversification and a disciplined interest rate risk management framework. We also leverage PGIM's expertise across multiple asset classes, including its deep and long-standing experience in private placements and real estate. With respect to our investment portfolio, here are a few key points. We have a high allocation to government securities, which is primarily comprised of U.S. treasuries and Japanese government bonds. About half of our BBB and below rated corporate securities are private placements with financial covenants and structural protections that have consistently resulted in lower losses than comparable public securities. In past cycles, the loss experience of our BBB private placements has been comparable to A public credits or about half the losses of similarly rated BBB public credits. Our commercial mortgage loans are well-protected with a loan-to-value on the entire portfolio of 56% and debt service coverages in excess of 2.4 times. We are overweight in more defensive sectors, such as industrial and multifamily and underweight in both office and retail. We also have a low exposure in our investment portfolio to currently more vulnerable sectors like energy, retail and other at-risk corporates. Quality of our portfolio as demonstrated by its performance during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, where our credit loss experience compared favorably to peers. Since then, we have decreased our exposure to structured securities and BBB corporates and increased our holdings of government bonds and single A and above rated corporates. From 2008 through the first quarter of 2020, we our annual fixed maturity credit losses averaged just 13 basis points of our portfolio. Slide 23 in the appendix provides more detail on our investment portfolio to exposures currently in focus. While we expect credit losses to emerge, the main takeaway is that we feel comfortable that our exposure is quite manageable and that we are well capitalized to absorb such losses. Turning to slide 11, to help you assess potential credit losses on our investment portfolio over a three- year recession cycle, we provide a framework using publicly available rating agency and other third-party data for the underlying assumptions. This framework provides potential impairments defaults and ratings migration. The output suggests impact to PICA's RBC ratio and the solvency margin ratios in Japan would be very manageable and consistent with our expectations. Credit losses on an after-tax basis would total approximately $2.4 billion over a 3- year period. To put that into perspective, that will be less than 1 year of our free cash flow. Also, if we used experiences from the prior recession in 2008 as the underlying assumptions for this framework, the after-tax credit losses will be much smaller at about $1.6 billion. And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken. Ken Tanji : Thanks, Rob. I will begin on slide 12, which provides insight into earnings for the second quarter of 2020 relative to our first quarter results. We began with pretax adjusted operating income in the first quarter, which was $1.2 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.32 on an after-tax basis. Then we adjust for the following items : First, we expect variable investment income in the second quarter to be $150 million lower than in the first quarter. This is primarily driven by lower returns from private equity investments resulting from the decline in values in the first quarter, reported on a one quarter lag in the second quarter. Second, next, in the second quarter, we will have lower seasonal expenses, partially offset by higher implementation costs, which will result in a net benefit of $50 million. Third, there are other items that combined may be $45 million more favorable in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. This includes the normalization of PGIM's other related revenues in our Chilean joint venture income, which were lower in the first quarter due to the mark-to-market of assets for equity markets and credit spreads. This normalization is partially offset by classifying our Prudential Korea business as a divested business. Fourth, we expect fees to be lower on a run rate basis in the second quarter. This reflects account values starting the second quarter at a lower point than the average level in the first quarter. Next, we included a placeholder for potential COVID-19 related claims and expenses totaling $250 million. I will provide additional details of these items on the next slide. And last, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by $15 million, reflecting the difference between new money rates and disposition yields on our investment portfolio. These items combined get us to a baseline of $792 million of operating earnings and $1.53 per share for the second quarter. Please note that this baseline includes items specific to the second quarter that reduced EPS by approximately $1.22 per share. While we have provided these items to consider, there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the second quarter of 2020. Given the extraordinary circumstances created by COVID-19, on slide 13, we provide estimates for the potential operating earnings impact directly associated with the pandemic in 2020. As part of our risk management process, we model many potential stress scenarios, including a pandemic scenario. We have substantial reserves and highly liquid assets to ensure we are well positioned to readily satisfy all policyholder claims and continue to be well capitalized. We also benefit from the diversification of our businesses, and specifically, the complementary nature of our retirement longevity business in our mortality businesses. Although, the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain, we thought it would be helpful to provide estimates for the potential impact on net mortality and costs in 2020. The estimate for the impact on net mortality assumes 100,000 deaths across the total U.S. population and 40,000 deaths across the total population in Japan. After considering the profile of our insured policyholders, we estimate the impact on earnings from net mortality may be approximately $200 million in 2020. Also, assuming the spread of COVID-19 is substantially contained in the second quarter, we estimate approximately $135 million of earnings impact may occur in the second quarter with possibly lower impact in the second half of the year. Also, as we continue to support our employees and families during this difficult time, we expect to incur additional costs, primarily related to sales support, employee health protection, technology and other expenses. In 2020, we estimate these costs will be approximately $230 million with $115 million of these costs in the second quarter. Turning to slide 14. We continue to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position exceeds our AA financial strength target and we maintain liquid assets at the parent company that are greater than three times annual fixed charges. Our financial leverage ratio is at our target and our regulatory capital levels at our insurance companies remain higher than the targets. In addition, we have substantial sources of funding, our cash and liquid assets at the parent company were $5.3 billion at the end of the quarter. As previously highlighted, we expect to receive net proceeds from -- of approximately $1.7 billion from the sale of Prudential of Korea business following the close of the transaction, which is expected in the second half of 2020. And another source of funding is free cash flow from our businesses, which represents approximately 65% of earnings over time. In addition, we have readily available off-balance sheet resources. This includes a $4 billion credit facility with 23 banks and a syndicate structure across the U.S., Europe and Asia. We also have access to $1.5 billion of funding from a contingent capital facility with the right to issue debt in exchange for U.S. treasury securities held by a trust. And we have a bank -- Japan Bank facility with \u00a5100 billion available to Prudential Holdings of Japan. Turning to slide 15, and in summary, we are committed to fulfilling our purpose to make lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world. We maintain a rock-solid balance sheet with a robust capital and liquidity position, and we remain on track with our objectives for the year as we accelerate the execution of our initiatives. Now I'll turn it over to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Looks like our first question comes from the line of Erik Bass of Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Erik Bass : Hi. Thank you. First, can you provide a bit more color on how you're coming up with your estimated COVID impacts and how you're thinking about the interplay between mortality and longevity exposures. And then also just to clarify on the expenses. Is that just related to COVID, or is that a net impact factoring in other things such as lower T&E expense? Ken Tanji : Yes, hi, Eric, it's Ken. I'll take your questions. On the COVID estimates. First, I want like to recognize that these are placeholders. These are based on an estimate of 100,000 deaths in the U.S. and 40,000 deaths in Japan. Now we'll have to see how things play out. And there's likely a range of outcomes around that for the U.S. and Japan. So I just want to recognize that we've done our best to give a placeholder, but it's predicated on a number of assumptions. What we do then is we then make considerations for lower fatality rates for the insured populations versus a general population. We certainly have taken certainly have taken in consideration higher fatality rates for the older population and then we took into consideration the geography of our insured population with \u2013tend to have a little bit higher concentration in New Jersey and New York, California and Washington. So when we put that all together, we've applied those to our average profile and provided those estimates. And again, we'll likely have a good range around some of those assumptions. In terms of our retirement business, it does provide an offset to some of our life insurance as we've expected and designed. It offsets about 30% of our exposure, and that's just kind of how the modeling plays out. And then your second question was around the expenses. We've \u2013 we looked at the steps that we need to take in order to care for our employees for crisis care as well as compensation for sales professionals, particularly in international locations, if our sales were to decline. And we've estimated that is the appropriate thing to do given the situation. We will \u2013 we haven't included in that estimate, potential offsets for the fact that travel and conferences and entertainment will be lower. We would expect if things return at some point to normal that some of that might come back you know sort of rebound. But I would estimate that we are going to have savings here in the next quarter or so that you can think of that in the tens of millions, but that's not included in the estimate. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Next, we have the line of Suneet Kamath of Citi. Your line is open. Suneet Kamath : Thanks. I wanted to go to long-term care. Earlier this week, one of your competitors announced a regulatory review of long-term care reserves resulted in a pretty sizable increase to stat reserves. So just curious if any of your regulators are contemplating or conducting similar reviews and maybe over what time frame would we expect any resolution, if there are such reviews in place? Thanks. Ken Tanji : Yeah. Hi, this is Ken, Suneet. Just an ordinary course, we review our reserves with our regulators. And they have not indicated any concern about our level of reserves related to long-term care, and there's no special review underway. Operator : Next in queue, we have the line of Tom Gallagher of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Tom Gallagher : Good morning. The $2 billion of debt that PRU issued in 1Q is, I think being counted as operating debt. So just curious why that's counted as operating debt, I think which is excluded from the leverage calculation and what your plan is with those proceeds? And then let's see the other question I had is just on the GAAP breakage you had on the variable annuity side this quarter? Was there also a similar statutory level of breakage. I realize it's uneconomic based on the accounting differences between the assets and the liabilities. But just curious, if you had a similar impact on statutory? Thanks. Charlie Lowrey : Yes. Hey, Tom, it's -- I'll take those. On the $2 billion of debt included the $1.5 billion that we issued at the holdco. You can think of that as we would ordinarily have issued, say, $500 million earlier in the year and $500 million towards the end of the year. But we decided to do $1.5 billion in March. We were worried about how the conditions were developing and thought it would be prudent to do $1.5 billion, which essentially will take care of any maturities in 2020 and 2021. So it's about $1 billion more than we would ordinarily have done perhaps, but we thought it was an appropriate thing to do. In terms of why we call it operating debt, right now, those proceeds sit at the holding company in cash. And we follow sort of the way that our rating agencies think about classifications of debt. So -- and the planned proceeds, again, we have it available at the holding company. And it would -- it's used -- it's available for paying off the debt again for this year and next year. In terms of the non-AOI item for the quarter, our variable annuity business is very well hedged. And we like to align our outcomes for GAAP us in stat economics. And as Charlie mentioned in his comments, it was highly effective at 99%. The way we hedge interest risk, again, which was highly effective in the quarter, is with both derivatives that mark-to-market and recorded in the P&L, but also by holding a 30-year U.S. treasuries, which had a $1.7 billion gain and would have offset the non-AOI item in the quarter. But the gain on the U.S. treasuries is recorded to OCI and not to the income statement. So economically, and from a stat standpoint, we were very well aligned just with a little bit of difference between where our gain is recorded for GAAP. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Ryan Krueger of KBW. Your line is open. Ryan Krueger : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Can you help us think about \u2013 I guess interest rate sensitivity within the balance sheet, both GAAP and stat? I think previously, you provided sensitivity for 10-year rates in the 2% to 2.5% range. But given where they are today was hoping for some additional sensitivity. Charles Lowrey : Sure. Yeah. Maybe I'll start with stat, Ryan. And the \u2013 we have had sensitivity to our stat financials, primarily around asset adequate testing. Last year, given the decline in rates, we increased our asset adequacy testing reserve by about $0.5 billion. Now we had derivatives that offset that, so we were with a gain. So we were \u2013 had a stable RBC outcome. But it's also important to know that sort of at this level of very low interest rates, that the way the testing works is the \u2013 when rates are so low, the shock is much lower. So we'll have less sensitivity to lower rates from this point forward. From a GAAP standpoint, our sensitivity really hasn't changed. And as you know, we have a process \u2013 I'll remind people that we have a process where we look at our long-term rate assumption and that includes doing a survey of economist banks and other managers. And we also look at the implied forward curve, and we look to be at the median of all that. And that's the process that we're going through. I'd also note that, the way our interest rate assumptions work for GAAP is we start at current rates and we grade to a long-term assumption over 10 years. So as a result, our \u2013 the 10-year treasury under the next seven years is less than 3%. So we're going through our process as we typically would and that will be finalized by our risk management committees in late June. So no change in our \u2013 significant change in our GAAP sensitivity, and we'll be doing our usual process in the second quarter. Ryan Krueger : Thank you. Operator : And next in queue, we have the line of Alex Scott of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alex Scott : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. First one, I have is just a follow-up on the stat rate sensitivity comments that you made. I just want to make sure I interpreted it correctly. I guess, as you go through your actuarial review and if the ultimate rate is set lower, does that reduce sensitivity sort of apply now? Like would we -- if it is sort of the 3% to 4% book value type impact on GAAP, would that not necessarily all translate to statutory? Charlie Lowrey : Again, the way asset adequacy testing works is we don't set a long-term rate. Those are prescribed by GAAP. And we're going through our -- and so it's a little bit of a different framework. And we'll also -- so we're working through that. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Next in queue, we have the line of Nigel Dally of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Nigel Dally : Great. Thank you. So, I had a question on the -- on buybacks. You spend a fair bit of time running through the strength of your current capital position? And also what appears to be quite a manageable stress scenario. Clearly a number of moving factors, but what are you looking for? What are sort of like some of the things that you're looking for to be comfortable in resuming buybacks? Should we assume that buybacks suspended through the end of the year, or potentially, could it be somewhat sooner than that? Any color there as to kind of how you're looking at that? Charlie Lowrey : Yes. The -- I think the primary thing we're looking at is the economic cycle. And we're seeing substantial impact given the situation that we're in. We like the quality of our investment portfolio, and we think it's manageable, but we want to see how this credit cycle emerges. So, I don't know if I can put a timeframe on that. I think time will tell. Operator : Next in queue, we have the line of Humphrey Lee of Dowling & Partners. Your line is open. Humphrey Lee : Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. My first question is related to Assurance IQ. The losses for the quarter looks a little bit larger than expected, like how should we think about those losses would trend? Should we expect for the next couple of quarters will be kind of in that $30 million range before seeing a recovery in the fourth quarter when activity started to pick up due to enrollment period? Andy Sullivan : Yes, Humphrey, good morning it's Andy. And thanks for your question, and I'll give kind of a little bit of a break here. So, on Assurance IQ, I would characterize the results for quarter one as modestly worse than what we expected. We have started to lean in from an investment perspective to building out the platform more broadly. And to bringing new product solutions onto the platform as we think the first-mover advantage is very, very important. As we talked about last quarter as well, we learned some lessons from a Medicare Advantage perspective and we are investing ahead of Q4 to make sure that we have the right number of agents and that they are fully and properly trained and we're ready to ready to go in the fourth quarter. So, I think you could think about performance similar in the next couple of quarters. And obviously, the large opportunity is in Medicare Advantage in Q4. Humphrey Lee : Got it. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Next, we have the line of John Barnidge of Piper Sandler. Your line is open. John Barnidge : Great. Thanks. If we were to assume the disease, a seasonal nature and returns at the very lease in 1Q 2021, could you help me dimension how many of these non-mortality and morbidity CV-19 cost would remain on a go-forward basis? Charlie Lowrey : Yeah. I don't think we want to try to forecast that far, which -- given the situation. Eventually, I think we will operate differently given the changes in environment and the way we're going to have to conduct business, but that's a bit out there. So I don\u2019t think we want to start to look through that far at the moment. John Barnidge : Okay. And then could you maybe provide average age on the products where you have some CV-19 exposure, please? Andy Sullivan : Yeah. So -- this is Andy. So, obviously, two predominant areas there are, really are individual life business and our group life business, and then obviously offsets in the longevity business that we have in retirement. So actually, an individual life and in group insurance, average age across the whole book is relatively similar in the -- about 55. And in group insurance, in particular, though, 95% of that business is under the age of 65. As far as of the longevity risk transfer business and the pension risk transfer business our average age is in 74 to 75 range. John Barnidge : Thank you. Operator : And next in queue is Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. My first question is on the group business. Can you just discuss your outlook for the margins within that business for the rest of the year, just given that I think COVID-19 could impact some of those businesses, or do you think that we might not see an impact there maybe until 2021? Andy Sullivan : Yeah. Elyse, this is Andy. So I'll take that question, and there are a number of impacts. So maybe I'll start more on the claim side of things. And we do expect, and it was in the estimates that Ken walked through. That we will see increased mortality in the book of business. Obviously, in the group business, as I just referenced, that's somewhat mitigated by the average age. But we do think that, that will go up. We also believe and have seen evidence that we'll see an uptick in short-term disability incidents. So that will serve to compress margins throughout this year. We see a couple of other impacts I just mentioned from a sales and flows perspective. Most of our book of business is medium and large size employers. So actually, most of our sales for 2020 are already baked in that business. And any slowdown we're seeing is more of a 2021 impact. I guess, the last thing I\u2019d mention is a lot of the impacts that group insurance will feel, we actually are mitigated against from the perspective that we're not in the under 100 live segment business. So we don't have exposure to the small segment employers. And, obviously, here, early days, that's where a number of the impacts have been. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, great. And then my second question, you guys, in your prepared remarks, went through shifting the business to less interest rate-sensitive products. How do we think about the capital that you have to put forth to write some of the new business where there\u2019s less interest rate-sensitive versus some products that maybe required more capital, is there kind of capital arbitrage there some products that may be required more capital. Is there kind of a capital arbitrage there as you kind of shift your writings in this low interest rate environment? Ken Tanji : Yes. I'll take that. The products that we are shifting towards do have less interest rate sensitivity, things like variable life things like we\u2019re looking to release a structured variable annuity. And so, they will be less capital-intensive and less interest rate sensitive. I don't think there's anything more to the dynamic than that. Andy Sullivan : And this is Andy. Maybe I'll just add some color commentary. So, in the individual life business, as Ken referenced, we've been shifting towards variable life. We're very pleased in Q1 that our sales were $187 million which was up 15% -- Q1 of last year and 50% of those sales were variable life. We've also in April launched a product that is much less sensitive to interest rates and equity markets tuned to the RIA channel. And our buffered annuity, we're very excited about that launch. That has become a robust market. And 60% of the volumes in that marketplace are going through independent broker-dealers, and we have very, very strong relationships there. So, we think to be very promising for us. Operator : Next in queue, we have a follow-up from the line of Suneet Kamath of Citi. Your line is open. Suneet Kamath : Yes, thanks for the follow-up. On the Individual Life business, in the past, you guys have talked about using reinsurance to either dampen down the earnings volatility or actually free capital. So, I want to get an update on that? And is that strategy still effective or still possible given all the uncertainty around COVID-19? Andy Sullivan : Yes Suneet, its Andy. And maybe I'll take that question up a level first. As we talked about last quarter, we are leaned into performing the overall -- to improving the overall performance of that book of business in that business. We\u2019ve three levers. First, we are very much leaned into improving the expense profile of the business. A lot of our future of work, energy and effort is aimed in that regard. And we actually saw a reduction year-over-year in our expenses on business. So, we like the progress we're seeing there. The second lever is leaning into and growing the business with profitable business that we're putting on the books. And as I mentioned, our sales are up year-over-year. And we are comfortable with the pricing and the profitability of the business that we\u2019re selling. As far as the third lever and it\u2019s the lever that you referenced, it really is looking at the ability to reinsure the block of business. We continue to explore solutions. Obviously, we\u2019re looking very carefully about what is the right economic favorability for us and if and when we take action on that, we will report out on it, but nothing to report as we sit here today. Suneet Kamath : I just have one quick follow-up for Ken, I guess, a follow-up to Elyse's question on capital. You cited in your prepared remarks pretty significant declines in sales, both in the U.S. as well as Japan. So, any sense of how much capital or lower strain could you guys experience relative to a normal year based on that sales decline? Ken Tanji : Yes. So all things being equal, we would have less -- if we're selling -- when we sell business, we capitalize it well. And if we're selling less that means it's requiring less capital to support it. And so, we would expect all other things being equal that would be the case. I think it's too hard to quantify that right now Ken Tanji>: We'll see how our sales plays out. If we have if we have opportunities to make sales in attractive business, we'll do that. If the conditions are such that either the returns aren't attractive or it's too difficult to conduct business that would lower sales and we would see some capital offset for that. So I just don't -- I think it's a little tricky to put a number on that right now. Suneet Kamath : Got it. Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We do have a follow-up from the line of Alex Scott of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alex Scott : Hi. Thanks for taking the call. I just wanted to see if you could provide an update on the mortgage loan book. And I guess, specifically the commercial mortgage loans, would be interested if you can operate anything up around like how much of it you've got forbearance requests on and what you'd expect there? Rob Falzon : Alex, it's Rob. Let me handle that one. We haven't received forbearance request. The vast majority of that, as you would expect is coming from the hotel and mall tenants having said that to date through April in any event, we've actually granted forbearance on a little less than 3% of the portfolio. And that by and large almost entirely has been just with respect to principal amortization, the loans continue to remain current with regard to interest payments. We do expect that that will build over time to some greater amount, but having said that, we're actually quite comfortable. If you look at the loan-to-value that we have across the mortgage portfolio, it's at 56% and based on our internal appraisals. What we find is if we actually use external appraisals that drops to around 46%. So being in a position to be able to provide forbearance on principle, we don't think actually puts at risk our ability to be repaid on those loans given the relatively low amount of leverage that we have on our property, and combined with the fact that our mortgage portfolio is very concentrated in higher quality well located properties. So we're feeling quite good about the status of the mortgage portfolio, and we expect it to be resilient through this crisis as it has been in fact through all prior of our recessions. If you look at the 2008 recession and you sort of take that and you roll that forward, we've had sort of a 1 basis point loss ratio on our mortgages from that period until now. So we actually feel pretty good about the way in which we've underwritten it, and we feel very good about the way we're positioned going forward. A \u2013 Andy Sullivan : Alex, it's Andy. I was just going to add a point from our third-party managed fund business, very similar trends. We've to date seen low single-digit levels of forbearance. And clearly, that will rise over time, but very similar trends to what Rob covered. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Next, we do have a follow-up from Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Your line is open. Humphrey Lee : Thank you for taking my follow-up. Looking at PGIM, so other related revenue has always been a source of variability for that segment. I think this quarter, you had some spread related kind of issue hurting some of the private credit. But looking forward, like some of the strategies that you have in PGIM, whether it's real estate or private credit or some of the specialty products, they're likely to see lower activities, so how should we think about the other related revenue will trend for the balance of the year? A \u2013 Andy Sullivan : Yes. So Humphrey, it's Andy. So you're correct. In first quarter, the predominant impact in other related revenue was from our strategic investing portfolio. That's where we have our seed strategies as well as where we co-invest alongside of our clients. The predominant impact was in -- from credit spread widening on the fixed income portion of that portfolio. In general, if you look back, we tend to have somewhere in the neighborhood of $50 million to $60 million coming from our ORR. We do think it is reasonable as you kind of look forward over the next couple of quarters Obviously, we think flows will be lumpier in general, and we do believe that there will be some slowdown in client activity and then transactions. So there may be some near-term pressure on that. But over the long run, you could think of that in the $50 million to $60 million range. Operator : With no further questions here in queue, I'll be happy to turn it back to Charlie Lowrey for any closing remarks. Charlie Lowrey : Great. Thank you very much. We'd just like to say in closing that we'd like to take a moment to thank all our employees for the extraordinary steps they've taken to support our businesses, our customers and our communities. Together, we remain financially strong. We remain resilient, and we remain committed to fulfilling our purpose of solving financial challenges of our changing world, including doing our part to contribute to an inclusive global recovery. Thank you all for joining the call. Please stay safe, and we look forward to talking to you soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call.

At this point, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I'll turn the call now to Mr. Darin Arita. Please go ahead, sir. Darin Arita : , : Today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of such measures to the comparable GAAP measures and the discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, please see the slide titled Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures in the appendix to today\u2019s presentation, which can be found on our website at investor.prudential.com. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Charlie. Charlie Lowrey : Thank you, Darin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I\u2019ll start by saying we hope that you, your families and colleagues remain safe and healthy during these extraordinary times. The events of the past several months have created unforeseen new difficulties for people around the world, while further exposing the deep-seated problem of an equity in our society. It's in times like these that we believe our company's purpose of solving the financial challenges of our changing world and standing by our employees, customers and communities is most important. After transitioning over 95% of our US employees and most of our international employees to remote work in March, we continue to seamlessly serve customers, while the vast majority of our employees around the world continue to work in that fashion. This allows us to exercise utmost caution as we evaluate how and when to return to the workplace. In the meantime, I am so proud of our people and how they've continued to focus on meeting the evolving needs of our customers, many of whom face new challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact. We\u2019ll continue to innovate the ways we serve our customers during and after the pandemic. During the second quarter, we maintained a clear focus on executing against our 2020 initiative, despite the challenging macroeconomic backdrop. By delivering on progress on our cost savings targets, aggressively repricing and pivoting products to mitigate the impact of low rates on our performance and rotating our international earnings mix. We\u2019re also focused on identifying opportunities for further action, particularly as we look to continue to reduce our sensitivity to market. And we\u2019re exploring the potential to generate additional cost savings on top our existing 2020 targets. Throughout this period, we benefited from the strength of our rock-solid balance sheet, which gives us the confidence and the flexibility to navigate changes to the economic environment. I\u2019ll touch on each of these points in greater detail before turning it over to Rob and Ken for a look at our second quarter results. Turning now to our 2020 priorities on slide three. We remain on track to achieve our $143 million cost savings target for the whole years, and have achieved $75 million in savings year-to-date, with $45 million in the second quarter. We also continued to make progress in shifting our international earnings mix to higher growth markets. We remained on track to close on the sale of Prudential of Korea in the second half of 2020, and are advancing our review of strategic options for Prudential of Taiwan, which may include a sale. As I mentioned earlier, we are aggressively modifying our product mix, while exercising a highly disciplined approach to pricing in this low interest rate environment. Turning to slide four. While we are encouraged by the progress we\u2019re making to position our businesses and operations for the future, we continue to look at ways to work smarter and more efficiently in order to achieve cost savings on top of our target of $500 million by 2022. This includes using technology and automation, and leveraging the learnings from operating in a remote work environment to optimize how and where we work. In addition, we are looking at other ways to build upon our repricing and product shift to further mitigate the impact of market sensitivity. On slide five, we note how we're embarking on these initiatives, with the foundational strength provided by our balance sheet and robust capital position, including highly liquid assets of $4.5 billion at the end of the second quarter. Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries continue to exceed AA financial strength rating. Our second quarter assumption update had a modest effect on our financial results, even as we reduced our US long term interest rate by 50 basis points to 3.4%. Lastly, we anticipate receiving the US$1.7 billion of proceeds from sales Korea, our Korea business by the end of the year. In terms of capital deployment plans, we\u2019ll continue to monitor developments in the credit markets and the economy to determine our strategy. Slide six shows our second quarter financial results. This quarter exemplified the benefits of our thoughtful approach to risk management and our complementary business mix. We aim to balance mortality and longevity risk, so we don\u2019t have a one-sided exposure. In the quarter, we had net favorable underwriting experience. Our adjusted operating income was $931 million in the quarter. While we recorded a net GAAP loss, driven primarily by the non-cash effect of non-economic market impacts, which have no effect on our regulatory capital position. Our US businesses reported adjusted operating income of $455 million, due to more favorable underwriting, offset by the unfavorable impact of the assumption update and lower fee and spread income. PGIM reported record adjusted operating income of $324 million, as well as record assets under management of $1.4 trillion, a 9% increase from the year earlier period. This growth reflected strong flows into fixed income, as well as market appreciation. Our International businesses reported adjusted operating income of $693 million, as more favorable underwriting, higher earnings from joint ventures and business growth were offset by the unfavorable impact of the assumption update and lower spread income and higher expenses. Before turning it over to Rob, I\u2019d like to address the recent disturbing incidence of racial injustice and how we as an organization, are responding to the deep-seated and persistent problem of racism and inequity in society. Last month, we announced commitments to advance racial equity, as highlighted on slide seven. These commitments were borne out of the courageous candor of our employees, who have shared their experiences and their expectations, and the listening that is taking place all across Prudential. Taking a bottom-up approach, we developed concrete and measurable actions spanning our talent practices to how we design and deliver products, to the investments we make and how we foster social and racial equity in the communities where we work and do business. We already had a substantive set of programs underway and a body of work that reflects our long-standing commitment to racial equity, including investing over $1 billion in our hometown of Newark. We recognized that this moment calls for us to amplify what Prudential has already been doing to drive change within our company and within society. It is a moral and it is a business imperative that aligns directly with our company's purpose to solve the financial challenges of our changing world, as well as our multi-stakeholder commitments to employees, customers, shareholders and society. We stand by the promises we make, and we are prepared to be judged for our actions to support our colleagues, customers and communities today and over the long term. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Rob. Rob Falzon : Thank you, Charlie. And I want to reemphasize your comment about our commitment as a management team to supporting racial equity. This is an issue that is aligned to our purpose, it's part of the fabric of our culture and critical to our success as an organization. I'll now provide an update on how we are executing on our strategy within our US, PGIM and International businesses, as well as on the outlook for these businesses, and we\u2019ll also provide an update on our investment portfolio. Turning to slide eight. Our US businesses produced a diversified source of earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income. We continue to execute on three key priorities. First, we\u2019ve implemented pricing and product actions to simplify and derisk our business mix, while protecting profitability. For example, we took aggressive pricing actions aligned with intention to significantly reduce sales of HDI, our legacy flagship VA product and launched FlexGuard, our buffered annuity product, which has been well received by the market, supporting our product mix shift to less sensitive, less interest sensitive solutions. And in our Individual Life business, we suspended sales of our single life guaranteed universal life product in July. This will result in the continued shift to variable life and other less interest rate-sensitive products. We will continue to take product and pricing actions, including steps to diversify our mix of business, to maintain profitability in this interest rate environment. As a result, we expect individual annuities and individual life sales to continue to move lower in the near term. Second, as the needs of our customers rapidly evolve, including in response to COVID-19 and its economic impact, we are increasingly leveraging technology to enhance customer engagement and efficiency. For example, we've expanded our process to electronically deliver policies from application submission to policy issuance, and have increased the use of our fast-track automated underwriting process. And we have expanded the use of electronic signatures and self-service customer capabilities across our businesses. And third, we remain committed to expanding our addressable market. The pandemic has amplified the financial wellness challenges that many US households face, and has highlighted the importance of our financial wellness platform and our life insurance, retirement, and financial planning solutions. We also continue to see increasing interest in our Assurance IQ platform from customers in the healthcare, life and P&C lines of business. In preparation for the Medicare annual enrollment period in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ve been progressing well with our agent onboarding and training process. Now turning to slide nine. PGIM is a top 10 global investment manager that continues to demonstrate the strength and resilience of its multi-manager business model. Our assets under management reached a record level of $1.4 trillion, up 9% from the year ago quarter, driven by net flows, as well as the positive impact from equity and credit markets. PGIM's long-term investment performance remains strong and has rebounded from the temporary downturn in the first quarter, more than 85% of assets under management have outperformed their benchmarks over the last three, five- and 10-year periods. This strong investment performance, coupled with diversified investment capabilities across asset classes, regions, and client segments, has led to continued growth. We generated nearly $4 billion of net third-party flows during the second quarter, driven by record retail flows of $9 billion. Institutional outflows were driven by a single passive equity client redemption. Our public fixed income platform generated flows of $10 billion, as it continues to benefit from our broad suite of strategies and the leading position of our franchise. And PGIM investments was the number one ranked US mutual fund franchise across active and passive asset managers based on net year-to-date sales. PGIM's asset management fees were up 3% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by the growth in average assets under management. In addition, other related revenues increased primarily due to higher strategic investment earnings as a result of strong investment performance and the effect of credit spreads tightening, reversing the widening that had occurred in the first quarter. We also continue to focus on cost discipline to fund growth and further increase our operating leverage. Turning to slide 10. Our international businesses, including our Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model, as well as other operations focused on high growth markets. As expected, Life planner sales decreased 30% compared to the year ago quarter, primarily reflecting lower sales in Japan due to COVID-19-related restrictions on sales activities. Life planner headcount, however, increased 5% compared to a year ago. Similar to Life planner, sales for Gibraltar were 34% lower, but the number of life consultants has declined as we continue to focus on quality distribution. In Chile, market returns in the quarter were higher than average and that contributed to an operating income benefit of approximately $25 million, reversing the impact we experienced in the first quarter. With respect to expenses across international, we provided appropriate sales support to protect and care for our captive distribution, as we noted last quarter. This contributed $55 million to expenses, which we expect to trend lower in the second half of the year. We have seen some recovery in Japan sales beginning in June as the state of emergency was lifted, and over time, we expect sales to normalize. In addition, to mitigate the impacts of reduced face-to-face sales, our agents have adapted to increased usage of virtual tools to connect with customers, and we have seen early signs of success. We believe that our needs-based selling approach and death protection product focus continue to provide important value to our customers. With respect to interest rates, we\u2019ve successfully managed through decades of low interest rates and other market challenges in Japan. As you have seen us do in the past, we adjust our product offering quickly to meet the needs and preferences of our customers, while also achieving our return expectations. We have already taken actions and will continue to do so as needed as we move forward. Now turning to slide 11. We have a conservative, quality-focused investment portfolio that reflects our robust asset liability management practices, commitment to broad diversification and a disciplined interest rate risk management framework. We also leveraged PGIM's expertise across multiple asset classes, including its deep and long-standing experience in private placements and real estate. Year-to-date credit migration and losses have trended below our expectations. For the second quarter credit losses were $139 million, driven by energy and consumer cyclical sectors. While we expect credit losses to be a multiple quarter story, we feel comfortable that our exposure is manageable and that we are well capitalized to weather whatever emerges. And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken. Ken Tanji : Thanks, Rob. I will begin on slide 12, which provides insight into earnings for the third quarter relative to our second quarter results. The key point is that our underlying earnings power increased slightly from last quarter, primarily reflecting higher equity markets. To help you see this, I\u2019ll start with pretax adjusted operating income in the second quarter, which was $931 million and resulted in earnings per share of $1.85 on an after-tax basis. Then, we adjust for the following items. First, the annual review of assumptions and other refinements resulted in a net charge of $334 million in the second quarter, primarily driven by a reduction of our long-term interest rate assumption by 50 basis points in the US. Next, we adjusted variable income to a normalized level, which is worth $130 million. Please note that while we have not included an adjustment for variable investment income for the third quarter, the potential exists for continued revaluation of private equity and real estate investments due to the current adverse economic conditions. While returns of our alternative investment portfolio are currently lower than our target returns, and will vary period-to-period, over time, this portfolio has generated income above our target returns. Third, we adjusted underwriting experience by $155 million. This reflects $100 million of favorable experience in the second quarter, primarily driven by reserve gains in retirement. We estimate claims experience in the third quarter will include $55 million for COVID-19. Next, there are other items that combined may be $75 million more favorable in the third quarter, primarily related to expenses and markets. We expect expenses, including implementation costs to be $130 million lower in the third quarter, this is primarily due to legal expenses in the second quarter. In addition, due to favorable markets in the second quarter, other related revenues in PGIM benefited by $45 million. And in [indiscernible] income in our Gibraltar segment also benefited by $25 million. We expect operating cost due to COVID-19 to be $25 million in the third quarter. And last, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by $15 million, reflecting the difference between new money rates and disposition yields of our investment portfolio. These items combined get us to a baseline of $2.63 per share for the third quarter. Please note that this baseline includes items specific to the third quarter that reduced EPS by approximately $0.19 per share. While we have provided these items to consider, to meet [ph] the other factors that affect earnings per share in the third quarter. On Slide 13, we provided an update on the potential impact of the pandemic. We have included a sensitivity for operating income based on the US population experiencing 100,000 of incremental deaths due to the pandemic. We estimate that this may lower operating income by $70 million. And this is less than the sensitivity we provided on our last earnings call, as we have seen a lower fatality rate due to COVID-19 in our US insurance businesses than previously estimated. Our third quarter baseline includes a net impact for mortality due to COVID-19 of approximately $55 million. The actual impact will depend on a variety of factors, such as infection and fatality rates, geographic considerations and progress in testing and medical treatments. We have also reduced our estimate for incremental operating costs due to COVID-19 and have estimated the potential reduction in other operating costs, such as for travel and entertainment. In the second half of 2020, we expect to incur incremental operating costs of $60 million due to COVID-19, with $40 million in the third quarter and $20 million in the fourth quarter. The estimate of these costs is lower than what we provided on our last call, primarily due to lower health benefit costs of our US employees and lower cost to support our sales professionals in Japan, as their productivity is improving faster than previously estimated. We also expect to have $30 million of lower travel and entertainment expenses in the second half of 2020. Turning to Slide 14, we continue to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position exceeds our AA financial strength targets, and we maintain liquid assets at the parent company that are greater than 3 times annual fixed charges. We have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company were $4.5 billion at the end of the quarter. We expect to receive net proceeds of $1.7 billion from the sale of our Prudential of Korea business following the close of the transaction, which is expected in the second half of this year. And another source of funding is free cash flow from our businesses. In May, we added a new $1.5 billion contingent capital facility that combined with our previous facility, brings our total available contingent capital funding resources to $3 billion. Turning to Slide 15. And in summary, we remained on-track with our objectives for the year, as we accelerate the execution of our initiatives. We\u2019re exploring the potential to increase our cost savings initiative and looking at additional ways to build upon our repricing and product shift to further mitigate market impacts. And we maintain a rock bound \u2013 rock-solid balance sheet with a robust capital liquidity position. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] First, with the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question was just on the mortality assumption you laid out for the third quarter. So if I look at your disclosures, longevity did benefit your results in both the Q1 and the Q2 this year. So I\u2019m just trying to understand why that would at least continue to some degree in the third quarter? Ken Tanji : Hi, Elyse. This is Ken. I\u2019ll take your question about the COVID mortality into the third quarter. So we - in our second quarter, we benefited from our longevity business in the UK. Mortality in the UK came in a little bit higher than we had previously estimated, and that resulted in a gain from our UK longevity reinsurance business. While there was fatalities in the UK in the second, right now that seems to be more contained and we wouldn't expect that to continue given the current fatality rates. So we also, in our new estimate, have incorporated into to that sensitivity, what we learned from the second quarter, which is in our - also in our life insurance and group insurance businesses, the fatality rates were lower than we previously estimated. So we've incorporated that into our new estimate. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thanks. And then second, on the capital side, you guys said in your prepared remarks that you would continue to monitor credit markets and the economy in determining your strategy. I guess, as we have one additional quarter under your belt, how are you thinking about capital return? Is it dependent upon getting the capital, you know, the $1.7 billion from the Korea sales towards the end of this year? Or is it more just dependent upon kind of more time going on and seeing how credit loss [ph] developed? Charlie Lowrey : Elyse, it's Charlie. I\u2019ll take that one. So as you know, we paused our share repurchases in the second quarter, in line with the risk framework that we had in place. And as you said, until we get better visibility into the depth and the duration of the pandemic, the possible recession and the credit cycle, we will maintain our financial flexibility and resiliency. When we get the clarity into those issues I just mentioned, we\u2019ll then share the timing of our plan to resume share buybacks and by how much, and that would also include the proceeds from the sale or potential sale of the Korean business. So we're going to focus on maintaining our financial strength. But when we get clarity into the issues going forward, we will certainly let you know, and we\u2019ll be transparent about it. Elyse Greenspan : Thank you. I appreciate the color. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead. Ryan Krueger : Hi, good morning. Could you elaborate on, I guess, the things you're considering that would cause a reduction in your market in interest rate sensitivity? And I guess, in particular, I guess, I would assume to meaningfully change that you - that would require some sort of in-force reinsurance transaction. But if you could elaborate some on what you're thinking about? Rob Falzon : Ryan, it's Rob. I'll take a shot at that. First, let me just bring it up a level and say, as we sort of think about our strategy on a go-forward basis, we think about the elements of that is, in the first instance, simplifying and derisking the business as we articulated in our opening remarks, The other components of that are about improving near-term earnings through the efficiency initiatives that we've talked about and which we think has some expansion opportunity associated with them And then obviously, continue to expand our addressable market in order to support longer-term growth. Specifically with regard to the derisking, I would characterize the repricing and product shifts that we've done as sort of the first steps transitioning to lower volatility, less interest rate and general market sensitivity across our businesses. For those products that we've either stepped back from or actually explicitly discontinued. So think about that as being HDI in the variable annuities business and guaranteed universal life in the life business. We'll look actively at opportunities to optimize the economics of the legacy blocks that are associated with those products. And those options range anywhere from simply sort of just running off the blocks to reinsuring indoor \u2013 looking at selling the blocks. A couple of other things outside of that across our products, we're actually looking actively at product design, as well as individual and aggregate limits that could reduce the amount of potential volatility that we get from any individual products or grouping of products. So you saw us significantly reduced the retention limits that we have within our individual life business, by way of example. Charlie hit on financial flexibility and resiliency, so we're going to retain our capital in order to make sure that we that in place. And we think that, that's an element of the derisking, at least in the near term. We're also looking at the investment portfolio, and looking at strategic asset allocation, re-optimizing sort of the risk return and volatility trade-offs that are associated with our equity, our credit and our interest rate exposures, in light of where we are in the cycle and the opportunities that are in front of us. And I guess the last thing I'd mention is that as we look at the growth of the business, on a go-forward basis, our strategic emphasis is really on growing the elements of our business that are less rate-sensitive and more predictable and more capital like, for instance, peach of our asset management business. So those would be the primary things that we're thinking about from a derisking standpoint. Charlie, I don't know if there's any further color you'd want to add on to that? Charlie Lowrey : Yes. Thanks, Rob. So, Ryan let me just try and connect some dots. Because over the past 18 months, as Rob said, we\u2019ve taken actions to begin to accomplish many of the objectives that Rob articulated, namely, lower market sensitivity, lower capital intensity of our business mix becoming more competitive in terms of serving our customers with processes, better processes and lower costs. And then finally, as Rob said, increasing growth, right? And so let me just tick through a number of things that we've done in order to achieve those objectives. We're sold or selling out of lower growth businesses, Italy, Poland, Korea and exploring options for Taiwan. We acquired assurance around which we have high conviction about growth in a business that isn't as market sensitive, so lower risk. We've significantly reduced or stopped selling certainly highly interest rate-sensitive products and annuities and IOI [ph]. We introduced less market-sensitive products such as the buffered annuity. We repriced almost our entire product line. We announced and are executing on our future work initiative, which will produce $500 million in cost savings with the potential to do more. And as Rob said, we're currently exploring other options on book to business that are market sensitive. So we're executing on a series of incremental changes that we believe will lead to fundamental change in our business mix and ultimately, the trajectory of the firm as we go forward. So that's a foundation off of which we are going to grow going forward. Ryan Krueger : Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And next from the line of Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead. Humphrey Lee : Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Regarding the kind of potential \u2013 hello? Charlie Lowrey : Yes, Humphrey we can hear you. Humphrey Lee : I know it's still probably in the early stage of planning. But is there any way to help us think line of about the potential size and scope of that impact? Should it be kind of comparable to what you've been targeting so far? Or just more of an incremental to what you \u2013 just a modest incremental to what you've been targeting? Rob Falzon : Humphrey, it's Rob. I'll take a shot at that. You cut out a little bit, but I think I understood your question. So as we have been in the course of executing on the efficiency initiatives that we had articulated earlier in the year - earlier last year. We've actually accelerated those actions. And in the course of doing so, we've actually institutionalized continuous transformation capability. And as a result of that, we're generating new ideas and strategies for further efficiencies that enhance customer experiences. Remember, that's sort of the first priority of that is they enable our businesses, putting us in more competitive positions, and it increases our operating profits, particularly in light of the \u2013 which is needed in particular in light of the impact of earnings of a low rate environment. The levers we're using Humphrey are pretty much the things that we've done to date. So increased use of technology and automation, process improvements, sourcing, org design, all the things that are classic. We just think there's - as a result of this continuous process, much further that we can go from \u2013 than what we've articulated to date. We're also contemplating learnings from the crisis and some of the implications of the pandemic and our experience in that on things like remote work, changes in communications and travel and use of technology on a go-forward basis. So all of that leads us to be optimistic that we can expand materially from where we are today. But we're not ready to quantify that. We'll provide more guidance on that when we get further into year. And once we finished our work, we'll \u2013 as Charlie indicated, will be transparent. Humphrey Lee : Appreciate the color. Shifting gear, looking at PGIM, as you mentioned, flows were very good in the quarter, especially on the retail side. But on the institutional side, even after that $4.5 billion of passive equity mandate redemption, flows were still connective [ph] So I was just wondering, can you comment on what you saw in the quarter? And then also, how is your pipeline looking out for - especially on the institutional side? Andy Sullivan : Sure, Humphrey. It's Andy. I'll take your question. And you were cutting in a little bit. I'm not sure if it was you or me. So retail flows are really a result of three things, very strong investment management performance, a broad and wide product portfolio and strong distribution. And we're performing well on all of those fronts. Our investment performance in the second quarter was very strong. All of our PGIM fixed income strategies outperformed benchmark. 96% of our equity - Genesis equities outperformed benchmark, so very, very strong fundamental performance. As you know, we've been building out our global distribution over time. So we were actually quite pleased with our flows in the quarter. We were the number one mutual fund family year-to-date, and had $9.5 billion in positive retail flows. We did have the $4.5 billion index passive flow related to QMA. That was a very low mandate. So think in the neighborhood of 1 to 2 bps. So literally, it was less than $1 million in fees. It also was the last of our - what I would call [Technical Difficulty] As you look forward, quarter-to-quarter, there will be variability. But over the long run, our fundamental investment performance, the strength of our distribution, we have had strong organic flows over the last five years, and we expect that to continue as we look forward over the next several years. Charlie Lowrey : Andy, you cut out for one sec. Do you want to repeat the point you were making about? I don't know that it was well heard on the number of passive large mandate passive funds. Andy Sullivan : Sorry about that. All I mentioned was the $4.5 billion outflow was the last large passive mandate that we have in our portfolio. Humphrey Lee : Got it. Appreciate the color. Operator : And next we\u2019ll go to the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore. Please go ahead. Tom Gallagher : Good morning. Charlie, just a follow up on Ryan's question on the - I guess, the range of things you're considering with risk transfer. I hear what you guys are saying on limiting new sales considering some reinsurance back books, it sounds like maybe on life insurance. Have you considered anything more transformational? And the reason I ask that is kind of a more moderate, we'll say, limited approach to the strategy probably from a shareholder standpoint is going to result in very limited growth as you have some of these businesses that you still own that are shrinking every year. So it becomes kind of a challenge from an annual earnings growth standpoint. Have you considered that? And would you consider something more extreme like an IPO of some of your capital market-sensitive businesses or a bigger reinsurance transaction? Or are you thinking in a more limited scale? Charlie Lowrey : So Tom, thanks for the question. I appreciate it. Let me just take a step back and then I'll answer your question directly, but - and make a comment about how we think about capital allocation and particular optimization. Because when we look across our businesses, what we\u2019re trying to both domestically and internationally is ensure we're optimizing that capital deployment. So we've mentioned in the past that we're looking at or continue to look at businesses such as IOI [ph] annuities and some of our international operations as well as LTC. You've seen us take some bold action in terms of Italy, Poland, Korea, potentially, Taiwan, et cetera. So what we're going to do is - and what we can assure you is that we will continue to look to ways to optimize capital and capital deployment to maximize outcomes for shareholders, right? Be that through significant dispositions, whatever flavor that may take, through potential share repurchases or through acquisitions. And right now, we have acknowledged - we'll continue to acknowledge that there's a high hurdle for any major acquisition given where our stock price is trading. We get that. But we're looking, as you've seen in the actions we've taken to date over the last 18 months. And I think what you'll see us do going forward is look at all our businesses in order to optimize the capital we deploy and how we do that. And that's our commitment to shareholders, and that's what we're doing. Tom Gallagher : Got you. Appreciate it. I guess, my follow-up is just, it looks like you've reduced pretty substantially the expense drag for the subsidies you were planning on or you've been paying to the Life Planners in Japan. Is that because you see greater visibility on a sales recovery emerging? Or have you guys lowered the level of subsidy? Scott Sleyster : Why don't I go ahead and take that, Tom? This is Scott. I think the answer is multifaceted, but maybe I'll speak first to the question on have we seen a sales recovery. We actually started to see a pretty good bounce back June, to the point where we were starting to get close to even to 2019 sales in both Japan and in Brazil. And that has continued and actually modestly strengthened in the month of July. So we are seeing a pretty good sales recovery, and we're encouraged. But of course, that is -- that has to be that has to be tempered by any kind of resurgence that could occur. In the case of the Life Planner, we were actually able to take what was an initial subsidy that was sort of an uncharacteristic payment that we have, and we were able to roll it into their bonusable plan. So a portion of the amount that we have for POJ is actually being deferred into their sales comp. So you're not seeing it as directly, but it's still there. Tom Gallagher : Okay. Thanks. Operator : And next we'll go to Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jimmy Bhullar : Hi. Good morning. First, just on your annual assumption review and the interest rate assumption. Obviously, it's more conservative than it was before. But still fairly optimistic versus market levels. So just if you could talk about what went into your thoughts on how much to reduce the rate assumption by? And why did you not like make a bigger adjustment given where market rates are? Ken Tanji : Jimmy, it's Ken. In terms of our long-term rate assumption, we followed a very established process that we've had for a number of years, and it considers multiple perspectives. So we look at, again, long-term interest rate forecast of economists, banks and managers. And we look to be at the median of all those. And for this year, when we looked at that, that meant a 10-year U.S. treasury rate in the long-term of 3.25% and 1% for the JGB in Japan. So we followed the same process we've had for a number of years. It's also important to know how we grade into that long-term assumption. We do that over 10 years, and the first two years follows the forward curve. And as a result, it's not just the long-term assumption, but the path of which we get there. And so over the next five years, our average rate would be 1.25%. In 10 years, it's about 1.9%. And so again, we have a pretty established process. We look at third-party inputs, and look to be at the median, and that was and that was the result for this year. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. And then any color on how your long-term care block has held up recently? And whether you've seen any benefit on your claims or reserves from the pandemic? Ken Tanji : We saw a little bit elevated mortality in our policies that are already on claim, policies that are already on claim, but it was but it was fairly modest, and I wouldn't call significant. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay, thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And next, we'll go to John Barnidge with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. John Barnidge : Great. Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered. But can you talk about commercial mortgage loan forbearance in the quarter, directionality of that as well? Thank you. Rob Falzon : John, it's Rob. Yes, to date, our - we've received forbearance requests that are about 8% or so of the portfolio. We provided forbearance and 6% of those instances and the remaining 2% are under review, and that excludes a little bit that we've gotten requests on that were declined. but in that, only about 1% of the requests resulted in a deferral of interest. In all other instances, we remain current on interest and they've been deferrals of principal. Recall that across our portfolio, our loan to values are actually quite low. And so as a result of that, when we defer principal, we're actually not particularly concerned about that because we know that the principal amount is actually quite safe. The average loan-to-value across our entire portfolio, based on our internal appraisals is 56-ish percent, using external appraisals, it will be about 10 points lower than that, so less than 50%. And so given that low LTV, accommodations on amortization of principal or repayment or principal, we believe there's a prudent thing to be doing, and if we can remain card on interest, that keeps the loans performing, and that's been sort of our experience to date. John Barnidge : Great. Thanks for the answer. Operator : And next we'll go to Suneet Kamath with Citi. Please go ahead. Suneet Kamath : Thanks. Just a question, first off, on variable annuities. One of the things that folks are talking about now is that the AIC is reviewing the mean to reversion assumption that they include in VA capital reform. So just curious if that \u2013 what if that was changed would you expect to see either a big impact on your hedging program or your capital requirements for VA? Ken Tanji : Hi. This is Ken. We've - I just a little bit of backdrop on this for us. We've managed our VA business with a very robust economic view and active hedging for many years. We're very supportive of a statutory framework that also is based on robust economic scenarios, both in terms of the long-term assumptions, but also the dispersion around those assumptions. Our internal scenarios that we use to manage the business are actually more conservative than those being considered by the NAIC. So we continue to advocate for appropriate economic scenarios within the VM-21 framework and we believe that it will be well positioned due to our - the internal framework that we've used to manage the business for many years. Suneet Kamath : Got it. Okay. And then just to shift over to international, if I could. Obviously, a lot of moving parts in terms of COVID, face-to-face sales, low interest rates, expenses. But as you think about the longer-term outlook for the Japan businesses, when do you see those businesses sort of back to earnings growth, as opposed to earnings declines or flattish earnings, again, just conceptually, how are you thinking about the outlook for that business? Scott Sleyster : Hi, Suneet. This is Scott again, I'll go ahead and take that. I guess I\u2019d talk a little bit about capital rotation mixed in with that question. We were seeing low growth in the developed markets in Korea, Taiwan and Japan. And you saw that we took out actions in Korea and we're considering those in Taiwan. And the reason that you see a difference between those businesses in Japan is that we have really strong market share in Japan, and we have a really high-performing LP model there. The business generates attractive returns over our cost of capital and it generates a lot of free cash flow to the parent. So we really like our Japan operation, and we continue to invest in it. That being said, overall premium growth in Japan is been negative for the last several years and the country continues to face demographic challenges. So the fact that we've been able to continue to grow in POJ has been a significant outperformance in the country. So I guess what I would say is, we expect kind of low single-digit growth in Japan. And if we're achieving that, that's actually very strong relative performance. And then in the context of a business system that's creating a lot of value and cash to the parent. In the meantime, we'll look for redeployment in higher-growth markets, but those are going to have to be opportunistic. Suneet Kamath : Okay. Thanks, Scott. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And seeing no further questions coming in, Mr. Lowrey, I'll turn it over to you. Charlie Lowrey : Okay. Thanks very much. So as we come to the end of the call today, I'd just like to thank you for listening and for your continued interest in Prudential. I also want to take a moment to thank all our employees for the steps they continue to take to support our business, our customers and our community, including our collective efforts to address racial equity at Prudential and in society at large. We continue to make progress on executing our initiatives for the year, and frankly, are working to do more even as the global health pandemic continues. Backed by our financial strength and guided by our purpose, we'll continue to focus on delivering meaningful outcomes and value to all our stakeholders. Thanks again for joining us today. We appreciate it. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Darin Arita. Please go ahead. Darin Arita : Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today\u2019s call are Charlie Lowrey, Chairman and CEO; Bob Falzon, Vice Chairman; Andy Sullivan, Head of U.S. Businesses; Scott Sleyster, Head of International Businesses; Ken Tanji, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by Charlie, Rob and Ken, and then we will take your questions. Today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of such measures to the comparable GAAP measures and the discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, please see the slide titled Forward-looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures in the appendix to today\u2019s presentation, which can be found on our website at investor.prudential.com. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Charlie. Charlie Lowrey : Thank you, Darin. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. To begin, I hope that you, your families and colleagues remain safe and healthy. As the global health pandemic continues, we remain intently focused as a company on caring for our employees and the communities in which we live and work, as well as serving the evolving needs of our customers and other stakeholders in the current environment. We are also incredibly proud and grateful for the continued dedication and commitment that our employees have shown in fulfilling our company purpose of making lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world. I\u2019d like to highlight a few of the ways in which we\u2019re serving the unique and evolving needs of our customers, who now more than ever are relying on Prudential to address their financial challenges. Since the beginning of the pandemic, PGIM has focused on providing clients with timely portfolio updates and asset allocation ideas. Our operational resilience, diversified global business model and strong performance has allowed us to support our clients. One example of the success is the growth of our U.S. mutual funds, where we are one of the top ranked companies based on net flows this year. In our U.S. businesses, we continue to pivot within annuities to our FlexGuard buffered annuity product, which offers downside protection and upside opportunity, at a time when customers face new challenges in protecting and growing their retirement assets. Following its accelerated launch to market in the second quarter, FlexGuard continues to gain momentum, accounting for 38% of our annuity sales this quarter. And in Japan, our Life Planner model with its highly personalized and customized approach to engaging customers continues to be resilient as demonstrated by our strong sales this quarter. During the third quarter, we continue to successfully execute on our strategic priorities for 2020, despite the challenging macroeconomic backdrop, including taking additional steps to expand our cost savings program. We also continue to benefit from the strength of our rock solid balance sheet, which places us on sound financial footing to navigate changes in the current environment. Turning now to 2020 priorities on Slide 3. On last quarter\u2019s call, we mentioned that we were exploring the potential to generate additional cost savings on top of our 2022 plan. Through the third quarter of this year, we realized approximately $135 million of our $500 million cost savings program. Based on our progress of accelerating the savings realized and creating new ways of working, we now expect to generate an incremental $250 million in efficiencies by the end of 2023, bringing our total cost savings program to $750 million. With respect to rotating the international earnings mix, during the quarter we announced an agreement to sell Prudential of Taiwan to Taishin Financial Holding, and expect the transaction to close in 2021 subject to all regulatory approvals. And we also closed on our transaction to divest Prudential of Korea and received proceeds of $1.6 billion. And finally, we continue to take additional steps across the company to reduce our exposure to changes in markets and rates by shifting sales momentum to less interest rate sensitive solutions, while aggressively repricing certain existing products. As an example in annuities, we are focusing on our efforts on delivering protected outcome solutions, like our FlexGuard product, and we\u2019re discontinuing all sales of our traditional variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits. We will also explore strategic opportunities for blocks of business, including reinsurance and other transactions. Turning to Slide 4. As we continue to execute against our strategic priorities, we remain grounded by our rock solid balance sheet, including highly liquid assets of $6.1 billion at the end of the third quarter. Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries continue to hold capital that exceeds the AA financial strength level. The financial strength gives us the confidence and the flexibility to manage our business for long-term growth, while navigating the current and future market environment. We also continue to closely monitor conditions in the credit markets, while they have been developing better than previously expected, we don\u2019t intend to restate buybacks this year. We believe this is prudent as the duration and severity of the pandemic and its effect on the economy remain highly uncertain. We\u2019ll provide more details on our 2021 capital deployment plans once they have been finalized and approved by the Board. Turning to Slide 5. I\u2019ll now take a moment to highlight our financial results for the third quarter. Pre-tax adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion in the quarter and after-tax adjusted earnings per share was $3.21, which benefited in part from strong variable investment income across our businesses. Our U.S. businesses reported adjusted operating income of $873 million due to higher net investment spread offset by lower net fee income in our individual annuities business, and less favorable underwriting driven by COVID-19 related net mortality experience. PGIM reported record adjusted operating income of $370 million, driven by record assets under management of $1.4 trillion and higher other related revenues. The 11% growth in assets under management reflects strong flows, robust investment performance and market appreciation. Our international businesses reported adjusted operating income of $775 million, as business growth, lower expenses and more favorable underwriting results were partially offset by lower earnings from joint venture investments and lower net investment spread. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Rob for more specific details on our business performance during the third quarter. Thank you all for your time this morning. Rob Axel : Thank you, Charlie. I\u2019ll provide an update on how we are executing on our strategy within our U.S. PGIM and international businesses, the outlook for these businesses and a brief update on our investment portfolio. Turning to Slide 6. Our U.S. businesses produce a diversified source of earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income. We made progress in the quarter executing on three key priorities. First, we continue to implement pricing and product actions to simplify and de-risk our business mix, while protecting profitability. For example, we were further pivoting to less interest rate sensitive solutions in individual annuities by discontinuing sales of traditional variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits, including both our Highest Daily Income and Prudential Defined Income products. In our Individual Life business, we are repricing products to mitigate the impact of low rates. In addition to suspending sales of our single life guaranteed universal life product in July. As a result of these actions, we expect individual annuities and individual life sales to continue to move lower in the near-term. In addition, we continue to adjust crediting rates in our retirement business. Second, as the needs of our customers change, including in response to COVID and its economic impact, we\u2019re evolving the way we work. We continue to adapt to develop new ways of working effectively in remote locations and expect to recognize additional cost savings as we expand the use of technology, optimize our real estate footprint and benefit from a more efficient workforce. As Charlie mentioned, these and another opportunities to further efficiencies and improve our customer experience have resulted in a 50% increase in our originally planned $500 million earnings improvement target. And third, we remain committed to expanding our addressable market. For example, we continue to see strong interest in our Assurance IQ platform from customers in the health care, life and P&C lines of business. And preparation for the Medicare annual enrollment period in the fourth quarter, we accelerate our agent onboarding and training processes. While we were only three weeks into the annual enrollment period, we were pleased with the customer demand that we\u2019re seeing, which is driving considerable sales growth. Now turning to Slide 7, PGIM is a top 10 global investment manager that continues to demonstrate the strength and resilience of its multi-manager business model. PGIM\u2019s strong investment performance and diversified global investment capabilities across public and private asset classes, especially higher returning and income generating strategies across fixed income, alternatives, real estate and equities, position us favorably to continue to capture flows amidst industry-wide dislocation. Our assets under management reached a record level of over $1.4 trillion up 11% from the year ago quarter, driven by strong flows, robust investment performance, as well as market appreciation. PGIM\u2019s long-term investment performance remained strong with more than 90% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks. This strong investment performance coupled with diversified investment capabilities across asset classes, regions and client segments has led to continued growth. We generated over $7 billion of third-party net flows during the quarter, including $5.3 billion of retail flows and $2 billion of institutional flows driven by a continued appetite for fixed income strategies, partially offset by moderating equity outflows. Our public fixed income platform generated flows of $11.6 billion, as it continues to benefit from our broad suite of strategies and the leading position of our franchise. And the combination of customer demand, fund performance and investments in product development and distribution over the past several years has resulted in PGIM\u2019s investments being ranked the second highest U.S. mutual fund franchise based on year-to-date net flows. PGIM\u2019s asset management fees were up 11% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by the growth in average assets under management. In addition, an increase in other-related revenues was driven by an increase in co-investment and seed investment earnings, record high agency loan production and higher incentive fees. PGIM\u2019s operating margin exceeded 37% for the quarter aided by the strong other-related revenues. As we continue to focus on generating efficiencies to fund growth investments and on delivering margin increases from operating leverage. While PGIM\u2019s operating margin will vary with market conditions, we expect margins to remain in the 30% range across the cycle. Turning to Slide 8, our international business includes our Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated multi-channel distribution model, as well as other operations focused on high growth markets. Our sales this quarter demonstrated the strength of our distribution channels and the continuing customer demand for the protection and retirement products we offer. Our distribution channels are also employing more virtual tools for non face-to-face sales and have benefited from the easing of pandemic related restrictions. Life Planner sales increased 57% compared to the year ago quarter, reflecting the resilience of a Life Planner model, easing of COVID restrictions in Japan, and higher sales ahead of U.S. dollar denominated product repricing in August. Life Planner headcount increased 3% compared to a year ago, due to stable recruitment and lower resignations. Similar to Life Planner, sales across Gibraltar\u2019s life consultant, independent agent and bank channels also increased in total by 30%. We believe a degree of sales were pulled forward into the current quarter due to repricing actions. And therefore we expect a lower level of sales in the fourth quarter with sales returning to more normal levels over time beginning in 2021. Current quarter adjusted operating income continued to be impacted by low interest rates. And we anticipate this trend to continue given Gibraltar\u2019s higher exposure to U.S. dollar products. We have taken pricing actions and we\u2019ll continue to identify opportunities to become more efficient. In addition, we had $15 million of COVID response costs primarily to support our life consultants in Gibraltar, which we expect will moderate in future quarters. Now turning to Slide 9, we have a conservative high quality investment portfolio that reflects our robust asset liability management practices, commitment to broad diversification and a disciplined interest rate risk management framework. We also leverage PGIM\u2019s expertise across multiple asset classes, including its deep and longstanding experience in private placements and real estate. There has been a slowdown in the pace of credit migration and impairments since the first quarter of this year, with year-to-date, credit migration and losses below our expectations. For the third quarter, credit losses were just $12 million. We remain confident that we were well capitalized to weather, whatever might emerge in the future. And with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Ken. Ken Tanji : Thanks, Rob. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the fourth quarter, relative to our third quarter results. Pretax adjusted operating income in the third quarter was $1.63 million and resulted in earnings per share of $3.21 cents on an after-tax basis. We then adjust for the following items : first, variable investment income outperformed expectations in the third quarter, which is worth $215 million. Second, we adjust underwriting experience by a net $35 million. This includes seasonally lower reserve gains and retirement, and an estimate of $60 million for COVID-19 claims experience in the fourth quarter. Third, we expect expenses and other items to be $70 million higher in the fourth quarter, primarily due to seasonal expenses and implementation costs. Fourth, we expect the net operating costs due to COVID-19 to be $5 million lower in the fourth quarter. Fifth, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by $15 million reflecting the difference between new money rates and disposition yields of our investment portfolio. And last, we expect the fourth quarter effective tax rate to normalize for third quarter items. These items combined to get us to a baseline of $2.48 per share for the fourth quarter. All note that, if you exclude items specific to the fourth quarter, earnings per share would be $2.93. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power increased slightly from last quarter, including the benefit from higher equity markets as of quarter-end. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that, there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the fourth quarter. In addition, as we look forward, we have increased the expected benefits from our cost savings program by $250 million by the end of 2023. We expect these benefits will be largely self-funded with incremental net savings emerging in 2022 and 2023. We will provide additional details about this program on our earnings call in February. On Slide 11, we provided an update on the potential impact of the pandemic. The estimated sensitivity of operating income for a 100,000 of incremental U.S. deaths due to the pandemic remains unchanged at $70 million. Based on our updated outlook, our fourth quarter baseline includes a net mortality impact of $60 million due to COVID-19. The actual impact will depend on a variety of factors, such as infection and fatality rates, geographic considerations, and progress in testing and medical treatments. Also, we continue to expect incremental operating costs through the COVID-19 to be $5 million in the fourth quarter. This includes additional operating costs of $25 million, partially offset by $20 million of lower travel and entertainment expenses. Turning to Slide 12, we continue to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position exceeds our AA financial strength targets. And we have liquid assets at the parent company that are greater than three times annual fixed charges. And we have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company were $6.1 billion at the end of the quarter, which includes the proceeds from the sale of Prudential of Korea, and other sources of funds include free cash flow from our businesses and other continuing capital facilities. Turning to Slide 13 and in summary, during the third quarter, we continue to successfully execute on our strategic priorities for 2020. We have taken additional steps to expand our cost savings program, and we continue to benefit from the strength of our rock solid balance sheet, which includes \u2013 which gives us the confidence and flexibility to navigate the changes in this economic environment. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Erik Bass of Autonomous Research. And your line is open. Erik Bass : Thank you. Can you provide some more details on where you expect the additional expense savings to come from? And how much of the cuts are efficiency initiatives and how much are sort of reflecting reappraisal of business volumes in the revenue environment? Ken Tanji : Eric, this is Ken. I\u2019ll start. And just by way of background, earlier this year, we put in place a transformation office and it\u2019s led by one of our senior business leaders, Phil Waldeck, and it\u2019s given us the capabilities to identify, prioritize and implement with a continuous improvement mindset. It involves all of our U.S. businesses and all of our functions. And so we\u2019re finding efficiencies through combining client service centers, process engineering, automation, through procurement strategies, and so it\u2019s a culmination of transformation across the company. So that\u2019s generally, what\u2019s driving that. Andy Sullivan : And Eric, it\u2019s Andy. I would just add, it\u2019s really not related to business volumes or revenues. It is core efficiency improvement, where we\u2019re applying process and technology and able to hit a number of costs reduction levers. So it\u2019s becoming more efficient at the business that we have. Erik Bass : Got it. Thank you. And then you\u2019ve talked about sort of all options being on the table for your in-force individual life and annuities blocks. And we\u2019ve started to see an increase in transaction activity across the industry. So hoping you can talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of buyer interest for liabilities like yours, and maybe the current bid-ask spread in the market? Charlie Lowrey : Sure. This is Charlie. Let me take it kind of at a high level and then turn it over to Andy. But you know, Eric, over the past couple of years, we\u2019ve been really active in beginning to change our business mix. So as you know, we\u2019ve sold our operations in Poland, Italy, and Korea, and now have agreement in Taiwan and we continue to focus on rotating our earnings mix to higher growth markets internationally. Now looking at the U.S., in terms of changing the focus within the business, we\u2019re on a path to de-risking and it have made major pivots to less interest rate sensitive and more capital light solutions in our individual annuities and in our life business. And specifically, you\u2019ve seen us pivot away from a VAs with lifetime income guarantees to less market sensitive products. And at the same time, you\u2019ve seen us in our life business pivot to simpler non-guaranteed products. But what we\u2019ve also said is that we want to accelerate the transformation. And I\u2019ve said that we\u2019ll explore reinsurance and potentially the sale of certain blocks. But I\u2019d add the caveat that these types of transactions are complex and they take time and as we explore our options, we want to make sure that we\u2019re making good economic decisions that are in the best interest of shareholders. So we\u2019re going to take all these things into account as we go forward. Andy, I don\u2019t know if you want to add on to that? Andy Sullivan : Yes, maybe I would just add Eric, you also \u2013 I think asked about what\u2019s the marketplace for these types of transactions and we will not quote on any specific deals that are going on. I think there are two important takeaways that we should discuss. One is, I think we\u2019ve generally believe that a number of these blocks of business and our block of business, its value is not fully appreciated in the marketplace. And I think if you look at the recent transactions that certainly has been, I think proven out. The other thing is that there is capital moving towards, these types of deals, and that there\u2019s capacity. So we\u2019ve \u2013 as Charlie said, we\u2019ve begun to work on these alternatives and when we have something more to report we\u2019ll certainly do so. Erik Bass : Great. Thanks for the comments. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Your line is open. Humphrey Lee : Good morning and thank you for taking our questions. I\u2019m just trying to bridge the comments, all just kind of sentiment towards that decision to not reinstate your share repurchase this year, given the credit concern, and your \u2013 at the same time, yours confidence about your balance sheet, I guess, what kind of \u2013 what do you need to see in order to make you feel comfortable to resume buyback? Charlie Lowrey : So Humphrey, it\u2019s Charlie. Let me take a stab at that one. In line with the risk framework that we have in place, we paused share repurchases in the second quarter. But it\u2019s really about this, until we have better visibility into the depth and the duration of the pandemic, a possible recession and the credit cycle, which still may be before us we\u2019re going to maintain our financial flexibility and the resiliency. And when we get clarity into those issues that I just mentioned, we\u2019ll share the timing with you of our plan to resume share buybacks, and by how much. But until then, we\u2019re going to focus on maintaining our financial strength with many of the unknowns still in front of us. Humphrey Lee : I guess just for a quick clarification. So you suggest \u2013 you do not intend to reinstate buyback this year. But does it preclude you from using some of your capital strength for acquisitions? Charlie Lowrey : Not necessarily, but again, we\u2019re going to take \u2013 we\u2019re going to take a very measured approach to that, because we want to maintain our financial flexibility. So we\u2019re not going to comment about any business or specific transaction. But if I can take this step back for a moment again, and just make a more general comment on how we think about capital allocation in particular optimization, as we look across our businesses, both domestically and internationally we want to ensure that we\u2019re optimizing capital employment. And you\u2019ve seen us do that with, some of the sales we\u2019ve done internationally, but we\u2019re going to continue to look for ways optimize capital and capital deployment to maximize outcomes for shareholders. But at the same time, we\u2019re going to take a hard look at the environment in which we\u2019re operating and make sure that again, we maintain our financial strength and our financial flexibility and our resiliency as we go forward. Humphrey Lee : That makes sense. And then my next question is related to Assurance IQ. So I think, in the prepare remarks, you talked about, you\u2019re excited with the activities so far in the quarter, granted, it\u2019s still very early in terms of the customer demand. I think last year that the challenge was, you see \u2013 you saw a similar \u2013 you saw strong demand, but then you were not able to [cutoff] [ph] the processing of those kind of incoming demand. So maybe can you talk about like how \u2013 like, in terms of demand relative to your kind of capacity where you stand so far for the enrollment period? Andy Sullivan : Yes, Humphrey, it\u2019s Andy. So I\u2019ll take your question. And as we discussed sort of from a lessons learned perspective from last year, we\u2019ve done a lot this year to make sure with that we were better prepared for the annual enrollment period. We direct contracted with the health carriers, which gives us a lot more flexibility and agility. We invested much more heavily in agent recruiting, licensing and training. And we began to bring on agents this year in the month of July, which was much earlier than last year. So we\u2019re repeating what Rob said, we\u2019re only about three weeks into the season. But we certainly see evidence that our investments are paying off and that we\u2019re having stronger performance than we had in 2019. Having said that about 50% of industry-wide Medicare advantage transactions occur in the last two weeks of the annual enrollment period and that\u2019s the first two weeks of December. So while we like what we see from a growth perspective in these early days, it certainly, too early to draw definitive conclusions. Humphrey Lee : Do you feel like given the activities that you\u2019re seeing and then some of the preparedness you\u2019re already in place, do you think Assurance IQ could turn positive for the fourth quarter? Andy Sullivan : Yes. I think in our materials we had given a walk to about $25 million for the fourth quarter. Humphrey Lee : Got it. Thank you. Andy Sullivan : Actually I had that number wrong. It was $15 million, Humphrey. Sorry, I was off, looked at the wrong line. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore. Your line is open. Tom Gallagher : Charlie just wanted to circle back on capital deployment as my first question, if we think about 2021 at this point, do you have a preference of buybacks or M&A and I ask in particular, because if you do free up capital from risk transfer deal there also happens to be, we\u2019ll say more activity, more things on the market now than there were recently. So curious, what your view is, if you\u2019re more likely to want to do M&A or buybacks at this point? Charlie Lowrey : Yes, Tom. Thanks for the question. I guess a couple of things. One, again, I would caution the people in thinking we\u2019re going to free up capital immediately. These transactions take a long time, and therefore we have to think through that. Secondly, I think it depends on the deal. What we have said before, is given where our stock price is, there\u2019s a fairly high hurdle, right? On the other hand to your point, there could be some very interesting things on the market. So we\u2019re going to have to balance if you will short-term accretion from stock buybacks, and long-term growth. And we\u2019ll have to weigh those two against the opportunity set that\u2019s out there. And the stock repurchase price at the time. Tom Gallagher : That\u2019s helpful. And what would define contribution be on the wish list of M&A interest from your perspective? Because I know you\u2019ve done more international and then you did it Assurance IQ in recent times. Andy Sullivan : So Tom, it\u2019s Andy. I\u2019ll take your question. We\u2019ve been very focused on strengthening out our value proposition in our full service retirement business. We\u2019ve talked a lot about over the last couple of years, the work that we\u2019ve done in financial wellness we\u2019ve pretty heavily invested in digital and mobile, and that has resulted in very good organic growth on that platform. If you look at our net flows over time, it\u2019s been very positive. We\u2019re completing our third year of record sales. We had our largest corporate client ever in the quarter. So we\u2019ve seen great success, even though, we certainly pay attention to the consolidation of this space. We\u2019ve seen great success organically growing the business, and that maintains our focus. Tom Gallagher : Okay. Thanks. And then just as a quick follow-up, the elevated level of non-blockable expenses at Gibraltar. Is that like, and I guess for the guide for 4Q, is that likely to continue into 2021? Or is there something that\u2019s more, I would say temporary regarding the lower earnings and higher expenses at Gibraltar? Scott Sleyster : Tom, this is Scott. The Gibraltar run rate base has been impacted by really two factors. And one here, this first one is more permanent. We adjusted our compensation structure for life consultants to better balance policy holding \u2013 policyholder servicing things like customer visits, persistency, and so forth. With new business production and then this led to a lower level of deferrable commissions. Overall, the commissions have not actually changed, but our immediate run rate was impacted by roughly $10 million a quarter. And we view this as permanent. Now we recapture that over the life of the products, but that takes a quite a while to pick up. By the way, we do not expect this to have any impact on Gibraltar\u2019s cash flow. Second Gibraltar does have a large block of U.S. dollar business, which is experiencing spread erosion due to declines in U.S. dollar interest rates. So it\u2019s really those two factors combined with the biggest thing the first. Tom Gallagher : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Suneet Kamath with Citi. Your line is open. Suneet Kamath : Thanks. I wanted to circle back to Assurance IQ, if we assume your placeholder of $15 million for the fourth quarters, right. I think it would still put you at a loss for the year versus your original guidance EPS accretion in 2020. So just curious, what\u2019s driving that, and then, should we \u2013 do you think we can get back on track to your \u2013 I think you had got it to $0.30 to $0.35 in 2021. Should we assume that you can kind of get back on track there? Or do you think it\u2019s sort of a more of a challenge to get this back to profitability for the full year or a full-year thing. Andy Sullivan : So Suneet, it\u2019s Andy. I\u2019ll take your question. And let me maybe raise it up a level, so we\u2019re very pleased that we bought this business model and set of capabilities a model that\u2019s not sensitive to interest rates or equity markets. Obviously, with what happened in the March timeframe, we\u2019re even more pleased to have this as part of the fold. We immediately got very focused on building out and expanding the business model. So that we could care for more needs in the mass market and middle market consumer set. So as we\u2019ve really worked on the business internally, success for us is not about near-term AOI. Success for us is very much about continuing to expand the reach and breadth of the platform and is very much measured in how we grow our revenues, is very much measured in the products that we have on the platform. So we began with life, you saw us immediately lean into Medicare advantage. And then more recently, we\u2019ve leaned into property and casualty. And again, I always remind this is from a distribution perspective, not from a manufacturing perspective. And these bring fee-based earnings that are very capitally efficient. So our focus is really expanding this out as rapidly as we can. Suneet Kamath : Okay. And then I guess a bigger picture question on your financial wellness initiative, when you guys talked about this at your latest Investor Day, we spent a lot of time talking about marketing at the work site, reaching the employees of your corporate customers. So if we assume that we\u2019re going to be in this work at home environment for longer, how are you modulating that initiative to make sure that you\u2019re still capturing the growth opportunity that you guys talked about when you can\u2019t do these group meetings that you guys discussed at the Investor Day? Thanks. Andy Sullivan : Yes. Suneet, its Andy. And I guess, right up front, I\u2019ll draw a very sharp distinction in our financial wellness work from what I would call worksite marketing, which I know a number of voluntary products are more worksite marketing with feet on the street in the employer. Ours was very much about building a set of capabilities that could really reach people when, where and how they want it. So there was a real digital focus to what we built. We\u2019ve had accelerating success, if you remember, there were sort of a couple of stages to what we were trying to accomplish. At this point we\u2019ve had a large portion of our employers adopt our capabilities, we\u2019ve 20 million individuals that have access to the platform that\u2019s ahead of our goals for 2020. We\u2019ve \u2013 in my words, permissioned 12 million individuals that they can access \u2013 we get access to market, our retail solutions that is also ahead of our goals. And at this point we\u2019ve put 15,000 retail customers into Prudential through the platform. As COVID came in the base capabilities were such that we were able to pretty quickly even expand upon as an example, our Prudential Pathways program and make it purely digital with webinars capabilities. And at this point, that\u2019s now reaching about 8.5 million folks. So we don\u2019t see the current environment actually hindering us at all. And it\u2019s really about how we built the whole platform. Suneet Kamath : Okay. Thanks, Andy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Your line is open. Ryan Krueger : Good morning. I had a couple annuity questions. One, in recent year you\u2019ve been sending dividends up to the holding company from the annuity and subsidiary, seems like in kind of the roughly $1 billion range give or take. I guess, so first question is to what extent was that negatively impacted by new business associated with writings [indiscernible] I guess, should we see some improvements there? And do you view the roughly $1 billion per year as sustainable in the current interest rate environment? Ken Tanji : Ryan, this is Ken. Our annuity business, as we\u2019ve mentioned in the past has been very well hedged and very well capitalized and as you mentioned, providing a regular source of dividends to the holding company. Now that has moderated over time as our sales have been below our outflows, the business has been getting smaller. And although we\u2019re quite happy with the launch of our FlexGuard product, it won\u2019t be in the near-term sufficient to outpace the outflows that we have on our in-force blocks. So, over time that will decrease our level of earnings and cash flow and you could see that as a moderating trend. Ryan Krueger : Got it. And I guess, from a legal entity standpoint, I know you\u2019re probably \u2013 sounds like you\u2019re more likely to pursue reinsurance. But just in general, is there any tied legally between the Prudential annuity subsidiary in PICA or other life insurance subsidiaries, or is it really separate? Ken Tanji : Our annuity business, is actually involves a couple major legal entities. One would be our Pruco Life of Arizona company, which is a subsidiary of PICA that had been \u2013 historically been the legal entity that we use to underwrite annuity business. But you may recall, many years ago we acquired an annuity company from American Skandia, that\u2019s what we call Prudential Assurance Life Assurance Company or PALAC. And that also has a variable annuity business in it. And so it\u2019s in a couple of different legal entities that are involved. Ryan Krueger : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of John Barnidge with Piper Sandler. And your line is open. John Barnidge : Thank you. You didn\u2019t really address this in the commentary on cost cutting. But when adding $250 million and pushing out the 2023, is this real estate savings that is far out enough that it could address leasing. Andy Sullivan : So John, its Andy. This is really just an expansion of our program, as Ken said earlier, every business and every function. So it is \u2013 real estate is part of it, but there are a number of different buckets. It really is across real estate, it\u2019s across better vendor management and procurement, more efficiency from a travel perspective. So it really goes across a number of areas. We learned a lot in the first 12 to 18 months of this program. We saw a lot of what was possible and feasible, and we basically expanded to every corner of the organization. So it\u2019s not one particular category, it\u2019s just from the success of the overarching program and accelerating it. John Barnidge : Okay. Thank you very much. And my follow-up would be the products within annuities and life that you\u2019ve suspended this year. Can you talk about the amount of assets associated with that that were suspended respectfully? Thank you for the answers. Andy Sullivan : So from an annuities perspective, I\u2019m not going to get this exactly right, but I think it\u2019s in the $110 billion and $120 billion range. And I don\u2019t have the guaranteed universal life in front of me. John Barnidge : Thanks for the answers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. And your line is open. Jimmy Bhullar : Hi. Thanks. So first, I just had a question on your disability loss ratio. It\u2019s actually margins in the business have been pretty good. Are you starting to see or expecting to see any impact from sort of higher unemployment and just a weaker economy on your benefits ratio in the disability business? Andy Sullivan : Hi. It\u2019s Andy, I\u2019ll take your question. So, we\u2019ve actually been very pleased. We have not seen an uptick in incidents in either our short-term disability business or our long-term disability business. That being said though, obviously we\u2019ve operated this business for many, many decades, and we know that in recessionary environments, there\u2019s generally somewhere in the neighborhood of a year lag from when that incident shows up. So we have invested to make sure that our claims teams have low, what we call desk loads, so that if and when that incident starts to tick up, we\u2019re well prepared for it. But we have not seen evidence of that yet. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. And then on \u2013 just on Japan sales, obviously you benefited this quarter from sort of front ending prior to the price increase. So I\u2019m assuming you expect sales to decline a decent amount next quarter. And then also, if you could just talk about how the conditions are in that market in terms of agents\u2019 ability to meet with prospects, and like given social distancing and everything else that\u2019s going on. Scott Sleyster : Sure. Thanks Jimmy. This is Scott. Well, as Rob noted in his remarks with the significant decline in U.S. interest rates, we implemented pricing changes in August across all of our U.S. dollar products in Japan. As you know, it\u2019s common for salespeople to use such a pricing change to stimulate client contact. And that tends to accelerate sales from maybe the quarter ahead prior to such a change. Sales in 3Q also did benefit from the relaxation of social distancing requirements in Japan that were implemented in the beginning of June. And I think you also ask on that question. We expect that such enhanced demand will taper off in the following quarter, but then we are expecting things really to normalize as we head into 2021. Overall, our distribution in Japan is largely operating in kind of a back to normal mode. And I think that really reflects the strength of our differentiated business model. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Your line is open. Josh Shanker : Yes. Thank you. If we go back in time maybe three years ago, I think that you would have said that, individual variable annuities is the core competency of the company that a lot of your competitors don\u2019t understand and are backing away from the market. Many of them pivoted to buffer annuities and whatnot. With you discontinuing sales of variable annuities with living benefits. Can you talk about what\u2019s the return characteristics of that product have been over the past three years where they stand today and what it means for the back book? Andy Sullivan : Josh, its Andy, I\u2019ll take that. So, our HDI and PDI block of business is a very high returning block of business as Ken talked about earlier. It\u2019s a well capitalized block and well hedged block and creates good cash flows. It\u2019s more of a go-forward perspective, if you think about the decision making around our product pivot, we\u2019re working towards more of what I would frame as an all weather portfolio, where we\u2019re taking less fully on ourselves, the interest rate and equity market risk. The HDI is our most sensitive product in that regard. So, we think from a go-forward perspective, as you noted, we are very, very good in the annuity space, we believe there still is a deep sea that need to help people with accumulation, and to help them with decumulation from a longevity insurance perspective. And we think our go-forward product portfolio does that well, but does it in a way that\u2019s more shareholder friendly. Josh Shanker : Do the financial advisors who work with you need a product like that in their silo from you, for you to remain competitive with them? Andy Sullivan : No. If you\u2019re asking about, do they need the sort of the HDI/PDI types of product? No, we\u2019ve actually \u2013 we benefit from our brand and our strength of our distribution. And I think that\u2019s really why you see such a strong start to our FlexGuard buffered annuity. It was 38% of our sales here in the third quarter, and we recently went through $1 billion in sales, and we haven\u2019t even finished fully rolling it out to all states and all advisers. So, we think our product portfolio will meet the needs of the advisors and we\u2019ll see good growth in it. Josh Shanker : Thank you for the answers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question is going back to the capital conversation. You guys mentioned you have over $6 billion of capital at the holding company. That\u2019s around 3x your fixed charges. So can you remind us what you typically like under normal times to keep as a holding company? And then as we think about 2021, and you mentioned, reevaluating capital return, once we kind of get out of COVID, will you go back to what you view as kind of that normal level of fixed charges at the holding company? Or do you think that you\u2019re going after this, we\u2019ll look to hold onto an extra buffer as well. Ken Tanji : Elyse, it\u2019s Ken. Our target for highly liquid assets in typical times is $3 billion to $5 billion. And we think that\u2019s a good level to carry to have the flexibility that a company like ours needs. So we are above that. We think these are different than typical times. And as Charlie mentioned, that\u2019s a prudent thing to do, and we\u2019ll continue to evaluate a number of factors, including the credit markets as we go forward. But again, our target is typically $3 billion to $5 billion that gives us ample flexibility in ordinary times, and we think now\u2019s a good time to be above that. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then, I was hoping to get more color on the PRT environment. We obviously with rates lower, deal activity slow in the third quarter. Typically volume does pick up in the fourth quarter as we close years out. Could you just give us some color on the pipeline there and thoughts about transactions that we could potentially see in the fourth quarter? Andy Sullivan : Yes. Elyse, it\u2019s Andy, I\u2019ll take your question. So you\u2019re absolutely right. If we look at sort of 2020, the marketplace \u2013 size of the marketplace versus 2019, 2020 is definitely going to be down. We think it\u2019s going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 20%-ish or so. Third quarter was relatively quiet. We are seeing a building pipeline in 4Q, but I would point out that, with a lower overall market size, we also have talked about in the past that we\u2019re now probably up to five plus competitors that can do deals of $1 billion plus. So we think it\u2019s going to be a very competitive environment in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re going to be very disciplined about how we approach the marketplace and we\u2019re going to pick our spots. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Mr. Charles Lowrey for any closing comments. Charlie Lowrey : Thank you very much. So in closing today, I hope today that we\u2019ve demonstrated our commitment towards and the ongoing momentum we have to transforming our business and financial performance in ways that deliver meaningful outcomes to our customers, as well as to our investors and other stakeholders. We continue to move with urgency and conviction to execute on and be true to our purpose of solving the financial challenges for more people. So, thanks again for joining us today. We appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive TeleConference Service.

Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Mr. Darin Arita. Please go ahead. Darin Arita : Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today\u2019s call are Charlie Lowrey, Chairman and CEO; Rob Falzon, Vice Chairman; Andy Sullivan, Head of U.S. Businesses; Scott Sleyster, Head of International Businesses; Ken Tanji, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by Charlie, Rob and Ken, and then we will take your questions. Today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of such measures to the comparable GAAP measures and the discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, please see the slide titled Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures in the appendix to today\u2019s presentation and the quarterly financial supplement, both of which can be found on our website at investor.prudential.com. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Charlie. Charlie Lowrey : Thank you, Darin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As we approach the one year mark of the global pandemic, I hope that you, your families and colleagues remain safe and healthy in this continuing difficult environment. As before, we remain deeply focused on the well-being of our employees, customers, communities and other stakeholders, and on addressing their evolving needs and challenges. Amid the extraordinary events of 2020, we continue to take steps to evolve our business for the future while living up to our purpose. Turning to slide 2. We successfully executed on a number of our strategic initiatives in 2020 to reduce our market sensitivity and increase our growth potential, including the expansion of our cost savings program, while further solidifying our already robust financial position. We\u2019re now focused on building upon our achievements over the past year to further accelerate our strategy. I\u2019ll speak to this next phase of our transformation in more detail momentarily, but will start by recapping our accomplishments in 2020. Turning to slide 3. We realized $215 million in cost savings during the year, exceeding our $140 million target. Recall that last quarter, we increased our cost savings target to $750 million to be realized by the end of 2023. We also began to rotate our international earnings mix towards higher growth markets. During the year, we completed the sale of our Korea business and announced the sale of our Taiwan business. We also took significant steps to address the low interest rate environment with derisking actions such as repricing products and pivoting to less interest rate sensitive solutions. This pivot included discontinuing sales of variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits and launching a buffered annuity product, FlexGuard, which is less sensitive to market fluctuations while continuing to serve our customer needs. Turning to slide 4. As we look ahead, we\u2019re building upon the actions we\u2019ve already taken, as well as our competitive strengths to significantly transform the Company over the medium term. To achieve this transformation, we expect to deliver on our cost savings program and to reallocate $5 billion to $10 billion in capital over the next three years, as we pivot towards higher growth and less market-sensitive businesses. In parallel to this capital reallocation, we anticipate returning $10 billion of capital to shareholders over the next three years. This includes dividends as well as share repurchases that are returning -- that are resuming in the first quarter, under our new $1.5 billion authorization. As a result of these efforts, Prudential should emerge as a higher growth, less market-sensitive, and more nimble business that is positioned not only to deliver growth for shareholders. But also to make a more meaningful difference in the financial lives of more people around the world. Turning to slide 5. As we transform to become a higher growth, less market-sensitive business, we expect to double our growth businesses to more than 30% of earnings and have our Individual Annuities business to 10% or less of earnings. We will change our business mix primarily through organic growth and programmatic acquisitions for both our global asset manager, PGIM, and in emerging markets within our international businesses. PGIM manages $1.5 trillion of assets, which we have grown both, organically and through acquisitions of talent and capabilities. In emerging markets, we have expanded with joint ventures and acquisitions in regions with large markets and favorable demographic tailwinds, such as Asia, Latin America and Africa. We benefit from strong relationships with companies that have a large footprint and a significant local market expertise. In addition, we will remain focused on investing in our other businesses to expand our addressable market as well as continue to improve expense and capital efficiency. Additional actions to change our business mix include derisking and other transactions in conjunction with running off certain blocks of business. The $1.6 billion of capital generated from the sale of Korea business is included in the $5 billion to $10 billion we plan to reallocate into our growth businesses. Our change in business mix will obviously not be a straight line. But, as we reallocate capital, we\u2019ll provide you with information to help you both understand and measure our progress. Turning to slide 6. We are well-positioned to execute this strategic plan with a rock solid balance sheet. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $5.6 billion in highly liquid assets. And our operating subsidiaries continue to hold capital to support AA financial strength ratings. Finally, let\u2019s turn to slide 7. During this time of change in transformation, our commitment to our Company purpose and to supporting all our stakeholders remains as fundamental as ever. The importance of this work is reflected in the multiple environmental, social and governance initiatives that we advanced over the course of this quarter and throughout 2020. Here are some of the noteworthy accomplishments. We became the first U.S. insurer to insure a green bond aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. We furthered our commitment to environmental transparency and accountability by disclosing our environmental impact through CDP, the world\u2019s leading environmental disclosure platform. Prudential scored an A minus on CDP\u2019s 2020 Climate Change Survey. We introduced nine commitments to advance further the work we\u2019ve been doing on racial equity, spanning our talent practices, our design and delivery of products, our investments and public policy works and our support of community institutions working to remove persistent obstacles to black economic empowerment. I\u2019m also pleased that we\u2019ll continue to tie inclusion and diversity with executive compensation. Three years ago, we added an inclusion and diversity performance modifier that factored into our 2020 compensation plan. Over this period, diverse representation amongst senior management has increased. We\u2019re including this type of modifier again to drive us to improve further our inclusion and diversity over the next three years. Before closing, I\u2019d like to say thank you to all our employees around the world. It\u2019s through your hard work and dedication that we\u2019ve been able to successfully help our customers and advance our transformation. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Rob for more specific details on our business performance. Thank you all for your time this morning. Rob Axel : Thank you, Charlie. I\u2019ll provide an overview of our financial results, and update on our strategic progress and highlights of our outlook for our U.S., PGIM and international businesses. Turning to slide 8, I\u2019ll begin with our financial results for the year. On a pretax, adjusted operating income for 2020 was $5.1 billion or $10.21 per share on an after-tax basis. In the fourth quarter, our pretax adjusted operating income was $1.5 billion or $2.93 a share. Earnings exceeded the year-ago quarter as increases in our PGIM and international businesses as well as our Corporate & Other operations, offset a decline in our U.S. businesses. Results of our U.S. businesses reflected heightened COVID-19-related mortality experience as well as lower fee income in our Individual Annuities business, primarily due to outflows. This was partially offset by higher net investment spread results, driven by higher variable investment income and lower expenses. In addition, we made a change in our Individual Life procedures that provides policyholders information to better manage their policies and premiums for certain flexible premium policies. Due to this change, we have revised the estimated premiums to be paid for these policies, resulting in an adjustment to reserves. We also established and incurred, but not reported, our IBNR reserve in our group insurance business for the expected increase in disability claims as a result of the lag effect from higher unemployment. PGIM, our global asset manager, reported record assets under management of $1.5 trillion, up 13% from a year ago, as well as higher net asset management fees and record high other related revenues. And, earnings in our international businesses increased 6%, reflecting business growth, lower expenses and more favorable underwriting results, partially offset by lower net investment spread. Turning to slide 9. Our U.S. businesses produce a diversified source of earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income, which includes the benefits from netting longevity and mortality experience. We continued to make progress this quarter, executing on our priorities, including implementing pricing and product actions to derisk our business mix while protecting profitability and expanding our addressable market. Our product pivot has worked well with sales of our buffered annuity, FlexGuard, doubling to $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter from $600 million in the third quarter. And the pandemic has increased awareness of the value of our broad set of life insurance and financial solutions as we continue to enhance our capabilities to reach people when, where and how they want. These capabilities include traditional agents and financial advisors, the workplace. [Technical Difficulty] million people have access to our financial [Technical Difficulty] With respect to Assurance, we launched our Medicare business a little more than a year ago. As a result of investments in our distribution capacity, marketing capabilities and development of new technology, we nearly tripled our fourth quarter Medicare revenues versus the year ago quarter. We expect to continue to grow these revenues as we further expand distribution, utilize newly developed tools for data-driven consumer product recommendations and broaden our marketing. In addition, this gives us further confidence as we develop and launch additional product lines. Customer interest for our simply term life insurance product through Assurance has been strong, although sales have been lower than expected. We continue to modify our underwriting processes to allow for more instant decisions. As we streamline this process and improve the customer experience, we expect our life revenues to grow. Total revenues are primary financial metric for Assurance as we concentrate on scaling the business, doubled versus the year ago quarter. We\u2019re adding more carriers in all of our existing markets and expanding into new product lines. To execute this expansion, we have increased our investments in marketing, distribution and infrastructure. We expect operating losses in the near-term and earnings to emerge as we reach scale. Now, turning to slide 10. PGIM continues to demonstrate the strength and resilience of its diversified platform as a top 10 active global investment manager. PGIM\u2019s strong investment performance and diversified global investment capabilities in both, public and private asset classes across fixed income, alternatives, real estate and equities, position us favorably to capture flows. PGIM\u2019s investment performance demonstrated resiliency with more than 90% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last 3, 5 and 10-year periods. This investment performance contributed $6.3 billion of third-party net flows during the fourth quarter, including $3.8 billion of retail and $2.5 billion of institutional flows, resulting in $20 billion of net flows for the year. Of note, PGIM investments achieved the highest U.S. mutual fund franchise ranking, based on net flows in 2020. PGIM\u2019s strong overall flows were driven by continued investor appetite for fixed income strategies, particularly higher-yielding strategies and for real estate. PGIM\u2019s asset management fees increased 12% compared to the year ago quarter, reflecting growth in average assets under management. In addition, record high agency loan production and the effect of strong investment performance on incentive fees as well as co-investment and seed investment earnings, drove significant growth in other related revenues. These results contributed to an increase in PGIM\u2019s operating margin, which was in excess of 36% for the quarter. While PGIM\u2019s operating margin will vary with market conditions, we expect to sustain a margin of approximately 30% across the cycle. Turning to slide 11. Our International Businesses include our Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other operations focused on high-growth markets. As anticipated, Life Planner sales in the quarter were reduced by the accelerated sales in Japan last quarter, following the U.S. dollar-denominated product repricing in August. For the year, we were pleased that sales were about flat as our high-quality distribution overcame the effect of the pandemic-related shutdown. Similar to Life Planner, Gibraltar sales were reduced in the current quarter, and sales for the full year were about even with the prior year. While we do not report separately on our emerging markets businesses, we would note that Brazil\u2019s life insurance in force grew by 10% from a year ago, and our Chilean pension business held its number one ranking for market share benefiting from continued favorable investment performance. On slide 17 in the appendix, we listed some of the emerging markets that we\u2019re in and our local relationships that have significant market leadership positions. And with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Ken. Ken Tanji : Thanks, Rob. I\u2019ll begin on slide 12, which provides insight into earnings for the first quarter of 2021 relative to our fourth quarter results. Pretax adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter was $1.5 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.93 on an after-tax basis. Then, we adjust for the following items. First, variable investment income outperformed expectations in the fourth quarter, which is worth $360 million. Second, we adjust underwriting experience by a net $65 million. This includes a placeholder for COVID-19 claims experienced across our businesses of $170 million, based on 250,000 COVID-19-related fatalities in the U.S. during the first quarter. Third, we expect expenses to be $165 million lower in the first quarter, primarily due to seasonal items in the fourth quarter. Fourth, there are other items that may be $40 million more favorable in the first quarter. As Rob discussed, in the fourth quarter, we recorded a charge for the change in our Individual Life business practice, which was partially offset by strong other related revenues in PGIM. Fifth, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by $15 million, reflecting the difference between new money rates and disposition yields of our investment portfolio. And last, we expect the first quarter effective tax rate to normalize. These items combined gets us to a of $2.54 per share for the first quarter. I\u2019ll note that if you exclude items specific to the first quarter, earnings per share would be $2.90 per share. The key takeaway is that this is roughly in line with the prior quarter. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the first quarter. As we look forward, I\u2019d like to bring your attention to a few other items in the appendix. In addition to the seasonal considerations on slide 25, we have included other considerations for 2021 on slide 26. Notably, we expect to realize an increase in cost savings from $250 million in 2020 to $400 million in 2021. We also provided the expected net cost for Corporate & Other, the yen foreign exchange rate and the effective tax rate for 2021. On slide 13, we\u2019ve provided an update on the potential impact of the pandemic. The estimated sensitivity of operating income for $100,000 incremental U.S. deaths due to the pandemic is $85 million based on our updated outlook. This is up slightly from our prior sensitivity as the virus more broadly spreads across demographics and geographies, including the insured population. As I noted earlier, our first quarter baseline includes a net mortality impact of $170 million, due to COVID-19. The actual impact will depend on a variety of factors, such as infection and fatality rates, geographic considerations, and the speed and effectiveness of the vaccine rollout. Turning to slide 14. We maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position continues to support a AA financial strength rating, and we have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent Company were $5.6 billion at the end of the quarter, which is greater than 3 times annual fixed charges. And other sources of funds include free cash flow from our businesses and other contingent capital facilities. Turning to slide 15 and in summary. We successfully executed our 2020 initiatives, and we are building on those initiatives to transform Prudential into a higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble business. And we continue to benefit from the strength of our rock solid balance sheet. Now, I\u2019ll turn it to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with Citi. Please go ahead. Suneet Kamath : Thanks. I wanted to start high level, if I could. Charlie, at the 2019 Investor Day, I think, you guys laid out a strategy around financial wellness. And that initiative was supposed to get you to double-digit EPS growth and a 12% to 14% ROE kind of over the long term. Based on what you\u2019re talking about today, do you need to take these additional capital reallocation steps to get there, or should we think about these initiatives as potentially pushing you above what you guided to? Rob Axel : Suneet, it\u2019s Rob. I\u2019ll jump in on that, if you don\u2019t mind. So, a couple of thoughts. One, since our Investor Day, obviously, rates have declined quite materially. And, given our current business mix, a low interest rate environment with a 10-year hovering around one, one, one, one five, [ph] presents headwinds to an improving ROE. I would note, nonetheless, that in a challenging year for the industry, 2020, we achieved an ROE of just under 11%. And I think that speaks to the strength and earnings potential of the mix of businesses that we have. I\u2019d also add that our focus, Suneet, is on not just ROE, but also on cost of equity, and importantly, the spread between the two. And the strategies and initiatives that Charlie outlined, I think, around derisking, simplifying and reducing market sensitivity and changing the business mix, I would look at as very much geared toward expanding that spread between our return on equity and our cost of equity. Suneet Kamath : Okay. And then, as we think about that $5 billion to $10 billion of capital that you\u2019re going to reallocate, is it fair to think about most of that coming from life and annuities? And, can you give us the amount of capital that\u2019s currently being consumed by those two businesses? Charlie Lowrey : Yes. Let me jump in on that, Suneet. As we\u2019ve said in the past, I think, everything is on the table, right? But, what we\u2019ve also said in this call is that we\u2019re really focused on annuities. And one of our priorities is annuities and shrinking annuities to 10% or less of earnings. But, in addition to that, what we\u2019re doing is that we\u2019re looking at all market sensitive, low-growth businesses or blocks of businesses in terms of runoff, reinsurance or sales. So, we\u2019re going to continue to look at those. Life will be one of the businesses we look at in addition to annuities, but not necessarily the only one. Ken Tanji : Hey Suneet, it\u2019s Ken. I\u2019ll just -- you asked about the amount of capital. Our annuities business is predominantly within one company and one statutory company called Prudential Life Assurance Company and its statutory capital is a little bit more than $6 billion. Our Life business is well capitalized, but it\u2019s across a number of companies. And I don\u2019t have that aggregate number handy here. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Yaron Kinar : I guess, my first question is around the reduction of earnings coming from Individual Annuities. Can you achieve that without a block transfer or reinsurance deal? And, the reason I ask that is, I would think that there may be a bit more of a challenge to dispose of that given that it is more of a GLWB variable annuity block? And, we haven\u2019t seen a lot of appetite for that in the market to date. So, maybe you could address those questions? Rob Axel : Yes. Yaron, it\u2019s Rob. I\u2019ll jump in first and then maybe Ken or Andy might want to jump in after me. But, just with respect to the first part of your question, as we think about our objective of getting our annuities business into -- to represent 10% or less of our overall earnings, I think as we indicated in our slides, not inconsequential component of that comes from the runoff of the existing legacy block, to the tune of about -- that legacy block runs off at about $3 billion a quarter. And so, that gets us to a range of 40% to 45% of our objective, just with respect to runoff. Why don\u2019t I ask to -- defer to Ken and Andy to talk a little bit about the multiples and deployment of capital in the market? Ken Tanji : Yes, sure. Yaron, our variable annuity business is, as we\u2019ve said in the past, very well capitalized. It has a good profitability, cash flow and risk profile. And we don\u2019t see the fact that it\u2019s a GMWB book to present any unique or difficult challenges. Yaron Kinar : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, I guess, on the flip side of that in terms of growth into the double growth markets. I\u2019m assuming there is this large inorganic component there, just considering the $5 billion to $10 billion that you\u2019re looking to deploy. In those markets, I would think the valuations there may be a little bit higher. So, how do you go about determining the use of -- prioritization of capital between buybacks, inorganic growth and organic growth in those emerging markets, asset management and the like? Rob Axel : Yarun, it\u2019s Rob. I\u2019ll start out with that, and then I\u2019ll turn it over to others to answer the second part of your question. Just in terms of the amount of inorganic versus organic. As you think about the businesses that are grouped together in that sort of area that we\u2019re trying to grow to in excess of 30% or more of our earnings, those are higher growth businesses. They\u2019re dominated by PIGM. And PGIM, as we\u2019ve said before, is a business that is growing in the mid to high single digits on an organic basis. And so, as we think about that combined with the emerging markets and Assurance, which we think have the potential for quite high-growth rates, we think that in excess of a third of our objective can be accomplished, simply by organic growth. So, let me stop there and turn it over to others to answer the second part of your question. Andy Sullivan : So, Yaron, it\u2019s Andy. Maybe I\u2019ll jump in. This is a good spot to talk about PGIM and our plans around PGIM and how to accelerate into programmatic M&A. But first, I\u2019d reemphasize what Rob said. We\u2019ve had great growth in that business, and we expect that great growth to continue. When we look at our M&A opportunities in PGIM, we\u2019re looking to do, as we\u2019ve termed programmatic, which we would frame as methodical and planful, specifically leaning into new product and investment strategy capabilities. We feel very confident that when we do that, we can gain leverage from our distribution, might and strength. Obviously, anything we do have to fit with our multi-manager model because we don\u2019t want to be disruptive to that multi-manager model. And particular areas of interest are areas that are higher growth parts of the asset management business. So I would name alternatives as a key area as well as international. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Erik Bass : How are you evaluating potential acquisitions in the growth markets that you\u2019ve highlighted? Are you focused on near-term earnings accretion, or is the bigger priority finding scalable properties with large addressable markets that you can grow over time? Scott Sleyster : This is Scott. Why don\u2019t I start with that on the emerging markets front. First of all, we expect to remain focused on Latin America, emerging Asia and Africa, and primarily on those markets where we already have established operations and partners. And in some cases, I think that would include expansion into adjacent markets. For the most part, we\u2019ve been looking at, if you will, expanding into the markets that we\u2019re already in. And so, we might be adding a capability or a little bit of scale. I think, in those situations, the valuations have been relatively attractive. But going back to Charlie\u2019s opening remarks, we\u2019re going to be a disciplined buyer and make sure that we\u2019re earning an attractive return over our cost of capital before we deploy any funds, over a reasonable amount of time. Thanks. Erik Bass : And then, maybe another one is on a similar topic, but as you consider annuity reinsurance transactions, how do you think about the challenge of replacing the lost earnings and potential for EPS dilution, if you\u2019re selling with a relatively low multiple business to potentially buy higher multiple businesses? Ken Tanji : Erik, it\u2019s Ken. We are reallocating capital, as you suggest, to achieve better growth, to lower our market sensitivity and improve our quality of earnings. And, the combination, again, will deliver higher growth and less market sensitivity. And that we will believe will get recognized in terms of a lower cost of capital and expanded valuation that would offset the dilution. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Jimmy Bhullar : First, I just had a question on the Assurance IQ results. It was a good quarter on revenues, but you generated loss. And it seems like, at least from the outside, the business has done significantly worse than would have been expected when you announced the deal. So, what are your impressions of how that transaction has gone, now that you\u2019ve had it for about a year, a little bit over a year? Andy Sullivan : Yes. Jimmy, it\u2019s Andy. So, I\u2019ll handle your question. And you\u2019re correct, we now have four full quarters of operating the business under our belt. And we are very encouraged and glad that we have Assurance as part of our business mix, and see it as an expansion extension of our business model. Pretty early on in 2020, we made an explicit decision because we saw market opportunity to both expand and broaden the Assurance platform. And we did that from both the product and a distribution perspective. So, if you think of -- from a product perspective, we began to add additional product lines, product categories, like Medicare and like Property and Casualty. On the distribution side, we determined that we would be more successful over the long-term, if we add it on to the on-demand agent model. So, we now have an external BPO agent component and we\u2019re building out a Prudential W-2 agent component. That leaning in to organically growing the business and expanding the business has led to a pretty significant increase in OpEx, as you would expect. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re so focused on revenues because now it\u2019s about scaling up the platform. And we\u2019re very confident over the long term about the growth potential, both from a revenue perspective, but also expanding margins over time. As we said in previous quarters, we don\u2019t intend to provide or update any Assurance specific guidance other than what Rob sort of said at the top of the section about, in the near term, given our organic investment that I spoke to, we expect operating losses. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. And then, just on your annuity business, sequentially, you saw an improvement in variable annuity sales. And I wanted to get an idea -- and a lot of that I think is being driven by the FlexGuard product. I just wanted to get an idea on, is that fully rolled out to your distribution, or is there sort of still ramp-up potential for sales in that product? And relatedly, should we assume that sales in 1Q and through the first half of this year would be weak, because you\u2019re withdrawing the living benefit -- traditional living benefit products? Andy Sullivan : So, Jimmy, it\u2019s Andy. I\u2019ll take the question. And let me start with FlexGuard. Yes, we\u2019ve been very, very pleased with the success that we\u2019ve had of the FlexGuard buffered annuity product. In essence, we rolled it out in May. And through the -- May through December, we almost crossed $2 billion in sales. We think it\u2019s one of the most successful launches probably in the industry. And, the strength there is really coming from the strength of our business, the fact that our brand is so strong, our distribution and our relationships are so strong and we came out with a very good product. To your question of around momentum, we still are rolling it out to additional third-party intermediary. So, we have some additional work to go there. And, we also have a couple of states left that haven\u2019t rolled out. So, we\u2019re seeing great momentum and expect that momentum to continue. To the second part of your question, given the pivot that we\u2019re doing in that business, it was a pretty assertive and material change to see selling of our highest daily income and Prudential-defined income products. They were a big part of our sales in the past. So, that will have an impact on our overall sales and flows. And, I think, you could expect that we will see outflows from the business, due to that change. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Elyse Greenspan : My first question, I guess, is going back to some of the transactions you\u2019ve been talking about on the annuity side. So, depending upon, obviously, structure, you could potentially -- and how the sales or transaction takes place, there could potentially be some hit that I imagine you could potentially take the equity. So, how do we think about the leverage within your capital plan? Can you just update us on where you would see leverage going? And, I\u2019m assuming as you think through kind of freeing up capital that you\u2019ve taken into account and that you could probably absorb some hits and still keep your leverage within target, so the capital freed up, like you said, be used for some of this M&A within the growth market? Ken Tanji : Yes. Elyse, it\u2019s Ken. As we look at these transactions, we\u2019ll be looking at a number of key metrics in making sure we keep them all in balance. That\u2019s whether it\u2019s potential charges or gains to our equity, depending upon the transaction terms, what it would do to our cash flow going forward, our earnings and our risk profile. And, very importantly, we\u2019ll be focused and disciplined on looking at fair value as we conduct these things. So, we\u2019ve managed our leverage ratio over time within our objectives to maintain our AA credit rating, and we\u2019ll continue to keep that a priority. Elyse Greenspan : So, how high could it go? How high could the debt [Technical Difficulty] go? Ken Tanji : We have some room and some flexibility. I don\u2019t want to pinpoint a number, and we\u2019ll -- but we manage to make sure we keep our objectives with our credit rating. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then, my second question, on your slide deck, you guys talk about growth market, doubling that to the greater than 30%. That does include -- you do mention that your growth markets do include Assurance IQ. So, I guess following up on one of the earlier questions. So, they\u2019re obviously embedded within the three-year outlook. There is some assumption for the Assurance contribution to earnings, because it sounds like your margins improve as the business scales. So, if you can give us a sense as you put this plan together over this three-year time period, what you\u2019re kind of assuming Assurance does ultimately add to earnings over time? Ken Tanji : Yes. Elyse, it\u2019s Ken. As Andy mentioned, we are very-focused on growing this business, and that includes expanding distribution, expanding product lines, and that\u2019s requiring that we make some investments to realize the growth potential that\u2019s in the business that will lead to a modest loss in the near term. But, as that business scales and gains efficiency, we would see that gaining profitability. That\u2019s what I\u2019d add. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger, please go ahead, with KBW. Ryan Krueger : In terms of the $5 billion to $10 billion of capital reallocation, given that your higher growth businesses are generally not -- wouldn\u2019t be very capital consumptive, is it fair to assume that $5 billion to $10 billion would also equate to the rough amount of programmatic M&A that you\u2019re anticipating to do? Charlie Lowrey : Yes. Ryan, it\u2019s Charlie. I think, that\u2019s a fair assumption. In other words, as we think about reallocating capital, we\u2019re reallocating capital from the lower growth, less market-sensitive businesses into the opposite, right, higher growth, higher market-sensitive businesses. So, it really is a reallocation of that capital, if you will, between the businesses. Ryan Krueger : Got it. And then, on the Individual Annuities business, can you give us a rough sense of what percentage of those earnings are generated from the blocks that you\u2019ve now discontinued that have living benefit guarantees? Charlie Lowrey : Right now our current earnings are driven largely by our legacy business. We\u2019re new in the FlexGuard space. We\u2019re gaining great traction, and it\u2019s going well. But, the majority of our current earnings are from our legacy business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Andrew Kligerman : So, another question on your M&A approach. You\u2019ve mentioned asset management, emerging markets. I haven\u2019t heard anything about Retirement and Group. And I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s -- I think, these are growth businesses. And I\u2019m wondering whether full-service and record-keeping and various group and voluntary businesses might be attractive M&As as well. Charlie Lowrey : Hey Andrew, it\u2019s Charlie. Let me start, and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Andy and Scott to elaborate some. But, I think, it\u2019s important to start with what we\u2019re not interested in, right? So, we\u2019re not interested in doing a mega transaction that expands over multiple businesses. What we\u2019ve said and what we\u2019re going to stick to is really looking at our less market sensitive, higher growth businesses, in this case, emphasizing asset management and emerging markets. And so, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. And we\u2019re going to do it in terms of programmatic M&A that really emphasizes a multi-manager model in PGIM and certain specific markets in emerging markets. But, I\u2019ll turn it over to Andy and to Scott to elaborate on that. Andy Sullivan : Yes. Andrew, it\u2019s Andy. I would just add, you specifically mentioned our institutional businesses. I\u2019ll frame it that way in full-service and in Group Insurance. We\u2019ve seen very good success in -- in particular with our financial wellness strategy at strengthening our institutional value prop in general. And that has led to good growth in both of those businesses. So, I would say, our focus in those businesses is to lean into that organic growth and to continue to see net revenue growth that flows from the investment in financial wellness. Andrew Kligerman : Got it. Very helpful. And then, in the Individual Life segment, I saw a line item, $130 million from reserve refinement. And, I think as I kind of very generally understand it, it was providing customers with information around options that they could have maybe in their UL policies. I\u2019m wondering what are those options, what exactly was offered to the customers, and just how did that $130 million reserves impact evolve? Andy Sullivan : So, Andrew, it\u2019s Andy again. I\u2019ll take your question. So, this was a business practice change, where in essence, we\u2019re giving more detailed communications to certain of our flexible premium product holders. The intention of that information is to help them proactively manage their policies and premiums. And, we believe that it will lead to less premiums coming in over time, thus, the financial charge. It does not have a material impact from a go-forward perspective on earnings. Andrew Kligerman : I\u2019m just trying to understand what would it mean that they don\u2019t have to pay premiums, they could use their cash value and that might prompt them to think, well, I shouldn\u2019t have been putting cash into the product. I just would like to understand what behaviors will change as a function of that, because $130 million is a significant charge. Andy Sullivan : Yes. So, Andrew, it\u2019s Andy again. So, in essence, on their annual statements and their payment notices, we\u2019re giving them more details around their premium flexibility, their requested premium amounts and their guarantees against lapsation. And we think that the customers working with their advisors, that will lead to less premiums coming in over time. Operator : Thank you. Next, we go to the line of Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Please go ahead. Tracy Benguigui : As you\u2019re in the market speaking with potential buyers of close block sales, wondering if PGIM third-party investors, maybe consortium, has expressed any interest or appetite? I mean, that does not preclude other buyers. Just want to get a sense of PGIM\u2019s familiarity crew can reduce the bid-ask spread at all. Andy Sullivan : So, Tracy, it\u2019s Andy. Thank you very much for your question. We absolutely think PGIM clearly is a net positive to this overall process. We see more and more capital that sees value in the types of things that we do. And, we think that does enhance our opportunity in many different ways. We feel advantaged in that we own world-class origination capabilities, very strong asset liability matching capabilities and PGIM as a world-class investment manager, in particular, being very strong in alternatives. And as I said earlier is that being one of the areas that we look to strengthen even further. So, I do think that that\u2019s a positive for us. And we\u2019re excited for the possibilities that could create over time. Tracy Benguigui : Okay, great. And then, besides your motivation of reducing market sensitivity, is part of the motivation to complete a block sale from the upcoming accounting changes from LBTI? Another insurers divesting their own life and annuity business and said that the reduction to equity under LDTI would have been worse than the book value loss from the sale. Now, I\u2019m not asking you to comment on that specific transaction, but just to get a sense of your willingness to sell at a law and how LDTI may be a motivating factor. Ken Tanji : Hey Tracy, it\u2019s Ken. First, TI is a few years away, and I don\u2019t want to comment on someone else\u2019s deal or nor do I have a specific transaction for us to comment on. But, with respect to deals, like I said, we\u2019re going to evaluate things through a number of metrics. One will be its impact on book value, earnings, cash flow, capital risk, we\u2019ll take that all into consideration. And so, I can\u2019t comment beyond there because it would be being too general. Charlie Lowrey : Well, Ken, maybe I\u2019ll just add, Tracy. Recall, our accounting that we use for our annuities is different than most others that are in the industry are using for their accounting. And under TI, there actually is not a significant change to the accounting of the living benefit in our book, vis-\u00e0-vis the way in which we currently account for it. So, that may be part of the explanation to your question as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Humphrey Lee : Just to follow back on Assurance IQ. I understand that you don\u2019t want to provide any kind of updated guidance in terms of revenue or margin since the original announcement, but basically, suggesting it will be in operating losses in the near term. Given the, I guess, where it has been trending, do you feel like you could turn to be profitable by 2022? And then also, how should we think about the impact on the additional earn-out? Looking at it right now, it doesn\u2019t look like that may be achievable. So, could there be any impact to the key person retention issues, given the changes -- the challenges on the earn-out? Andy Sullivan : So Humphrey, it\u2019s Andy. As we talked about, we are seeing progress as we launch product lines, the process we basically go through is we need to become more efficient at marketing those products. And then, obviously, as we build out the distribution end of things, we need to get to a place where we\u2019re getting better and better at conversion. We have seen quarter-over-quarter throughout 2020 our conversion rates get better. We have seen, and we won\u2019t get into specifics, but product lines that we\u2019ve started to see start to get towards the levels of profitability that we would expect. We\u2019re still not going to comment on specific timing, but we do like the trajectory that we\u2019re on and we intend to continue to investing. The operating losses near-term have everything to do with the decision we made to really accelerate our investment and now we have the job in front of us that we\u2019re confident in of scaling up the revenue. Ken Tanji : And Humphrey, it\u2019s Ken. On the earn-out, it\u2019s based upon variable profits, and it\u2019s over a three-year period. So, it\u2019s still in place until the 2022. And it was designed to incent them to outperform our expectations. And right now, it\u2019s still -- it has two years to go, and it\u2019s still in place. Humphrey Lee : Okay. Shifting gear, as you shrink the annuity business, how should we think about the overhead or kind of potential stranded costs related to shrinking that book of business? Especially given two years ago, when you talked about the financial wellness, part of the cost synergy was having all of the different businesses sharing the call center and the back office support. And now, you have a major part of that potentially shrinking and reducing your overall earnings contribution. So, how should we think about the potential kind of overheads related to that side of the business? And how are you going to address that? Charlie Lowrey : Yes. First, as we indicated with our progress in 2020, we\u2019re making a really good progress when we accelerated our progress and increased our objectives with our transformation program. And it\u2019s also given us capabilities that we\u2019ll be able to apply should, as we reallocate capital, we need to deal with stranded costs. Also keep in mind, we\u2019re reallocating that capital. So, as we may shift it from annuities, we\u2019ll be redeploying it into new earnings opportunities as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Barnidge with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. John Barnidge : Does it seem reasonable to think that there will be elevated administrative expenses and group disability to process COVID claims as long as the pandemic remains? I asked that in light of the 2-point increase for the year. Andy Sullivan : Yes. John, it\u2019s Andy. I\u2019ll take your question. Yes, your assumption is absolutely reasonable. One of the most important things during a period of time like this as a disability carrier is properly investing in the disability claims staff. So, some of what you saw in our admin ratio in the fourth quarter was us adding to staff. That\u2019s claims managers, that\u2019s nursers, that\u2019s folk specialists, to make sure that our claims personnel have the adequate time and space to properly help our customers and help them return to work. So, it is reasonable to assume as incidence goes up, which typically happens during the recession, we have not yet seen that on the LTD side, but we are expecting to see it, that we would continue to invest and maintain the right level of claims teams, and that would be a higher level of investment. John Barnidge : Great. And then, unrelated to that, Israel has been the country that has enacted the most aggressive vaccination program globally. Are there any markers that you\u2019ve seen out of the country in the weeks since they began this that provides maybe some insight around timing of maybe COVID tapering off a little bit? Charlie Lowrey : So, John, this is Charlie. I think, we are encouraged by what we see in terms of the -- both the introduction of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, but also the potential of Johnson & Johnson coming with a completely different kind of vaccine, right? It\u2019s a one-shot vaccine, it doesn\u2019t need cold chain storage. And we think that could have a large effect on the ability of this country to get vaccinations, if you will. So, over the course of the next three to six months, we\u2019re not going to say it\u2019s going to happen overnight, but we think there\u2019s going to be a material change in the ability to vaccinate people as we go forward. And that can only enure to the Company -- to the country\u2019s benefit and to the reduction in the transmission of the virus. Operator : Thank you. Next, we go to the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore. Please go ahead. Tom Gallagher : Hi. First question is, you mentioned that one-third of the $5 billion to $10 billion of capital deployment will come through organic growth. I guess, that seems like a high number, considering PGIM and Assurance IQ shouldn\u2019t have much capital intensity. So, is that largely coming from the OEM [ph] side? Charlie Lowrey : Yes. Let me clarify what I said, Tom. Apologies if I wasn\u2019t clear. What I was saying is that in excess of a third of the earnings growth that gets us from 18% of our total earnings to 30% of our total earnings comes from organic growth, not that in excess of a third of the capital is organic. So, I hope that clarifies that point. Tom Gallagher : That does. The other question I had is just a follow-up on the broader M&A strategy. I get, like group benefits and retirement aren\u2019t high growth businesses, but they\u2019re capital efficient. And so, just curious, why these wouldn\u2019t be M&A areas? Charlie Lowrey : So, let me start with that. And Andy, you may want to join in afterwards. But, the way we look at those businesses, and I think consistent with what Andy said before is, it is not that we are not investing in those businesses. We will continue to invest in them for purposes of organic growth. But, when you think about the areas in which we want to reallocate capital, if you will, to higher growth businesses with less market sensitivity, those are -- our priorities are certainly PGIM and emerging markets. And Andy, I don\u2019t know if you want to expand on that, but... Andy Sullivan : No, nothing to add, Charlie. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Josh Shanker with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Josh Shanker : If we go back to the Investor Day that we keep bringing up, I guess, the big difference is the parting ways of the annuities or at least certainly the high capital consumptive annuities. If I want to, like -- are there other strategic changes that really come out? Just put numbers to things that were already in motion, or are there other strategic changes embedded in those numbers that we really should focus on? Charlie Lowrey : So, I\u2019ll take a first stab at that, and then Rob, maybe you want to join in. But, I think when you look at our strategy, we still have the wellness strategy. That still exists. It\u2019s still a very much part of what was our Investor Day presentation back then and is -- continues to be there. What we\u2019ve done with a much lower interest rate environment and with a strategic review is, again, say, where we want to reallocate capital. And that\u2019s new, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve come out with this quarter, in terms of thinking where we want to be in three years with the higher growth businesses. So, if I were to articulate a difference, it would be there. And Rob, I don\u2019t know if you have other things you can elaborate on? Rob Axel : Yes, Josh, so thank you for the question. Just to elaborate a little bit on what Charlie\u2019s saying. I think, Josh, if you think about what we said in Investor Day, all of that is largely intact, as we described it around our organic growth opportunities. We have said that it\u2019s -- that our near-term aspirations around some of that are -- we\u2019re facing headwinds with regard to a much lower interest rate environment than we were in at the point in time in which we articulated that. But, I think it\u2019s not just the pivot away from annuities, but as Charlie said, it\u2019s also as contrasted to what we described at Investor Day, the reallocation of -- the active reallocation of capital more broadly and into those growth businesses. So, I would call -- not just call out -- not just the emphasis of annuities because of its -- not because we don\u2019t think incidentally, it\u2019s a very good business. We think it produces tremendous cash flows. It\u2019s well capitalized. It\u2019s well hedged. We just happen to believe that it\u2019s a business that will get better value in private markets than how we\u2019re getting rewarded in the public market for that today. And that gives us an opportunity to arbitrage capital and to reinvest it into areas in which we can be rewarded in the public market. And those would be the growth areas that we\u2019ve articulated. Josh Shanker : So in presenting the plan to the Board, where we\u2019re going to -- it\u2019s going to be probably earnings dilutive, but we\u2019re going to get higher multiple earnings out of it and less market sensitivity. Is there any frame for the magnitude of the dilution that was presented in order to make this change? Charlie Lowrey : So let me take a stab at that. And, what we really -- what we present to the Board and what we present externally is it\u2019s really a balance, right? It\u2019s a balance between the reallocation of capital into these higher growth businesses, but also a redeployment of capital. And in this case, we\u2019ve articulated $10 billion to shareholders in terms of share repurchases and dividends. And so, what we\u2019ve attempted to do is balance the two, right? Say, we\u2019re going into higher growth markets. And so therefore, hopefully, we will have a higher multiple as we go forward, and yet return a significant amount of capital to shareholders as we have done in the past and will continue to do in the future. Josh Shanker : Okay. Well, I\u2019ll try and do some math, and maybe Darin will help me out down the line. I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Now, we will turn it back to Charlie Lowrey, for closing comments. Charlie Lowrey : Okay. Thank you very much. In closing today, I\u2019d just like to reinforce our commitment to creating a new and more nimble Prudential, one that remains deeply focused on its customers, that will have a higher growth potential and will be less market-sensitive in the future. We\u2019re excited and we\u2019re optimistic about this next phase of our transformation. And we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. So, thanks again for joining us today. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Conferencing Service. You may now disconnect.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given to you at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Darin Arita. Please go ahead. Darin Arita : Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential in today\u2019s call are Charlie Lowrey, Chairman and CEO; Bob Falzon, Vice Chairman; Andy Sullivan, Head of U.S. Businesses; Scott Sleyster, Head of International Businesses; Ken Tanji, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by Charlie, Rob and Ken, and then we will take your questions. Today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of such measures to the comparable GAAP measures and the discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, please see the slide titled Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures in the appendix to today\u2019s presentation and the quarterly financial supplement, both of which can be found on our website at investor.prudential.com. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Charlie. Charlie Lowrey : Thank you, Darin and thank you all for joining us this morning. As always, I hope you and your families have remained safe and healthy. Despite the ongoing challenges created by the pandemic, Prudential reported strong results for the first quarter, including record adjusted operating income and robust sales and flows across many of our businesses. Our performance reflects strong underlying demand for our products, continued execution on our strategic initiatives, the complimentary nature of our retirement and life insurance businesses, which has helped us mitigate mortality risk, favorable markets, and the commitment of our employees around the world. We\u2019re on track with our key transformation initiatives and have increased returns to shareholders supported by our strong performance and the strength of our balance sheet. I\u2019ll cover each of these topics in more detail and begin with a brief review of the transformation initiatives, we highlighted for you in February. Turning to Slide 3. We\u2019re on track to deliver $750 million in cost savings by the end of 2023, $400 million of which were targeted for 2021. Cost savings for the first quarter were $110 million. The initiatives generating these cost savings are also producing better customer and employee experiences. And as a result, enhancing the competitiveness of our businesses. We are also in the process of reallocating $5 billion to $10 billion of capital by pursuing programmatic acquisitions to grow in asset management and in international emerging markets. In addition, we\u2019ll remain focused on investing in our other businesses to expand our addressable market and to continue to improve expense and capital efficiency. In parallel, we\u2019re actively executing on other means of changing our business mix and earnings profile by pivoting to less market and rate sensitive products, such as our buffered annuity product, FlexGuard, running off certain blocks of business and actively pursuing potential de-risking transactions. As a result, we expect Prudential to emerge as a higher growth, less market sensitive and more nimble company. As we execute against our transformation initiatives, you can expect that we\u2019ll continue to demonstrate discipline and the redeployment of capital within our businesses and to our shareholders. Turning now to Slide 4. In the first quarter, we increased our shareholder dividend by 5% and repurchased $375 million of common shares. In addition, based on our progress with our initiatives, as well as the improving macro economic outlook and the more favorable equity market and interest rate environment, we announced a $500 million increase to our 2021 share repurchase authorization. We expect to repurchase these additional shares starting in the second quarter. As a result, we now expect to return $10.5 billion to shareholders through 2023. Moving to Slide 5. Our expanded shareholder return program is supported by our rock solid balance sheet, which included $5.4 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the first quarter. Our operating subsidiaries continued to hold capital to support AA financial strength ratings. And we have a high quality investment portfolio. Turning to Slide 6. We are also executing on behalf of our stakeholders through our commitment to environmental, social and governance actions. This work has long been reflected in our purpose as a company of solving the financial challenges of our changing world and is as important as ever. Of recent note, on the environment, we have made significant progress, reducing emissions, waste and paper. And we continually evaluate how we can improve our impact on the environment. On social issues, we have invested further in our people with training and development programs and continued to maintain a high level of pay equity throughout the firm. We also achieved our three-year goal that we created in 2017 of increasing representation of diverse persons among our senior management by five points over that time period. We followed this by establishing new goals and are continuing to tie our goals to management compensation as we did in the prior period. And we\u2019re already making progress on our commitments to advance racial equity, which we announced last summer. On governance, we continually refresh our board with people who are highly skilled and who also reflect the diverse communities and geographies that we serve. Today, 82% of our independent directors are diverse. You can see more details on how we\u2019re progressing against our goals and commitments in our ESG summary report that we published in March. Before closing, I would like to thank all of our employees around the world. It\u2019s through their continued hard work and dedication that we\u2019ve been able to support our customers and colleagues during these challenging times, all while advancing our company\u2019s transformation and purpose of making lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Rob for more specific details on our business performance. Rob Axel : Thank you, Charlie. I\u2019ll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our U.S., PGIM and international businesses. Turning to Slide 7, I\u2019ll begin with our financial results for the first quarter. Our pretax adjusted operating income was a record high of $2.1 billion or $4.11 per share on an after-tax basis. Earnings exceeded the year ago quarter across all of our businesses. Results of our U.S. businesses were up 38% and reflected higher net investment spread results driven by higher variable investment income and higher fee income, primarily driven by equity market appreciation, partially offset by less favorable underwriting experience driven by COVID-19-related mortality. PGIM, our global asset manager had record high results, including a gain on the sale of our Italian joint venture. Our partner was acquired by another firm with an existing asset management business and expressed a desire to purchase our interest, which was a rated retained under the joint venture agreement. Nonetheless, assets under management of $1.5 trillion were up 12% from year ago, driving asset management fees to a record level. And earnings in our international businesses increased 25%, reflecting business growth, higher net investment spread, more favorable underwriting results and higher earnings from our Chilean pension joint venture. Turning to Slide 8. Our U.S. businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income to benefit from a complimentary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. As Charlie noted, we continue to make progress in shifting away from capital intensive and interest rate sensitive products. Our productivity have worked well with sales of our buffered annuity, FlexGuard, growing to $1.6 billion in the first quarter, representing 84% of total annuity sales, up from $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. Our sales reflect increasing customer demand for investment solutions that offer the potential for appreciation from equity markets combined with downside protection. In addition, we benefit from having a strong and trusted brand as well as a highly effective distribution team that has significant reach with Prudential Advisors and third-party advisors. We are engaging with a broad range of advisors with FlexGuard. We also leverage our broad multi-dimensional relationships with our strategic partners that both distribute our products and manage the assets of our clients. With respect to Individual Life, we increased sales by 9% compared to the year ago quarter as higher variable life sales offset lower sales of other policies, in particular, universal life sales consistent with our product pivot strategy. In our retirement business, account values were a record high, up 23% from a year ago, driven by business growth and market appreciation. Net flows in the quarter were $6 billion, including a longevity re-insurance transaction in excess of $8 billion. With respect to assurance, total revenues are our primary financial metric as we concentrate on scaling the business were up 80% over the prior quarter. We grew all business lines, particularly in Medicare, where we expanded distribution to increase sales outside of the fourth quarter annual enrollment period. Now turning to Slide 9. PGIM continues to demonstrate the strength of its diversified active management platform as a top 10 global investment manager. PGIM\u2019s diversified global investment capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, alternatives, real estate and equities, position us favorably to capture flows. In addition, PGIM\u2019s investment performance remains attractive with approximately 90% or more of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last 3-, 5- and 10-year periods. Our diversified capabilities and strong investment performance helps contribute to more than $5 billion of third-party net flows during the quarter, including $4 billion of retail and $1 billion of institutional flows. Offsetting the growth in net flows was a decrease in the market value of our fixed income assets, reflecting the increase in interest rates. As the investment engine of Prudential, PGIM, also benefits from a symbiotic relationship with our U.S. and international insurance businesses. PGIM\u2019s asset origination capabilities and investment management expertise provide a competitive advantage, helping our businesses to bring enhanced solutions and more value to our customers. And our businesses in turn provide a differentiated source of growth for PGIM through affiliated flows that compliment its successful third-party track record of growth. PGIM\u2019s asset management fees increased 15% compared to the year ago quarter to a record level as a result of market appreciation and continued positive third-party net flows. This contributed to an 8 point increase in PGIM\u2019s net adjusted operating margin, including the gain on the sale of the Italy joint venture \u2013 excuse me, excluding the gain on the sale of the Italy joint venture compared to the year ago quarter consistent with our expectation of 30% across the cycle. Turning to Slide 10. Our international businesses include our Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated multi-channel distribution model, as well as other operations focused on high growth markets. While sales across both Life Planner and Gibraltar operations were lower than the prior year, reflecting the disruption from Japan\u2019s metropolitan areas being in a state of emergency this quarter, as well as lower demand for our U.S. dollar denominated products, following price increases last year, profitability increased significantly. We remain encouraged by the resiliency of our unique distribution capabilities, which has helped to continue to grow our in-force business. And with that, I\u2019ll now hand it over to Ken. Ken Tanji : Thanks, Rob. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 11, which provides insight into earnings for the second quarter of 2021 relative to our first quarter results. Pre-tax adjusted operating income in the first quarter was $2.1 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $4.11 on an after-tax basis; then we adjust for the following items. First, variable investment income outperformed expectations in the first quarter, which is worth $275 million. Second, we adjust underwriting experience by $160 million. This includes a placeholder for COVID-19 claims experience of an additional $70 million based upon 55,000 COVID-19 related fatalities in the U.S. during the second quarter. Third, we expect expenses and other items to be approximately $500 million lower in the second quarter, primarily as a result of favorable items in first quarter, including the $378 million gain from the sale of PGIM\u2019s joint venture in Italy and seasonality. Fourth, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by $10 million, reflecting difference between new money rates to disposition yields of our investment portfolio. These items combined get us to a baseline of $2.89 per share for the second quarter. I\u2019ll note that if you exclude items specific to the second quarter, earnings per share would be $2.97. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power increased from last quarter, including the benefit from business growth and higher equity markets. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the second quarter. I would also note that we continue to expect the full year 2021 corporate and other loss to be about $1.5 billion. On Slide 12, we provided an update on the potential impact of the pandemic. Consistent with the information we provided on our fourth quarter call, the estimated sensitivity of operating income for $100,000 incremental U.S. death due to the pandemic is about $85 million. As I noted earlier, our second quarter baseline includes a net mortality impact of $70 million due to COVID-19. The actual impact will depend on a variety of factors, such as infection and fatality rates, geographic concentration, and the continued speed acceptance and effectiveness of the vaccine rollout. Turning to Slide 13. We continued to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position continues to support AA financial strength rating, and we have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets were $5.4 billion, which is greater than 3 times annual fixed charges and other sources of funds include free cash flow from our businesses and other continued capital facilities. Turning to Slide 14. And in summary, we are on track with our key initiatives that we maintain disciplined capital management while returning additional capital to shareholders, and we continue to benefit from the support of our rock solid balance sheet. Now I\u2019ll turn it to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore. Your line is open. Tom Gallagher : Good morning. Charlie, just wanted to see if we can get an update on potential timing and sizing of risk transfer deals, where things stand now for freeing up capital, and also say a team question on the programmatic M&A you\u2019re targeting. Rob Axel : Hey, Tom, it\u2019s Rob. Let me take a first shot at that, if you don\u2019t mind. So thank you for the question. The first actually, let me start with a reminder, a large portion of the broader business mix objectives that we have are actually going to achieve \u2013 be achieved organically. The internal growth objective we have, which essentially to double the growth of our \u2013 double the size of our growth businesses about a third of that is that targeted increase will come from the organic growth of those businesses. And then with respect to the targeted reduction specifically bringing our annuities business down to around 10% or so of total contribution 40% to 45% of that comes from the runoff of our legacy block. We didn\u2019t expect capital redeployment in the form of \u2013 on the growth side, programmatic acquisitions and then on the reduction side re-insurance and/or sales to largely closed the remainder of the gap. And as Charlie indicated in his opening remarks, we are actively executing on that, including through de-risking transactions on the reduction side. While we\u2019re making progress, we\u2019re not yet in a position Tom, where we\u2019re going to speak any more specifically, although, I\u2019d like to reiterate what we said before. First, these transactions are generally complex and therefore, they require time. And secondly, we intend to remain disciplined transacting both with respect to the dispositions as well as acquisitions to ensure that we\u2019re creating value for our shareholders in any transaction that we undertake. That\u2019s why we indicated sort of a relatively broad range of the $5 billion to $10 billion and a multi-year period for accomplishing that. Probably the last thing I\u2019d want to mention is that the product repricing and pivots that we\u2019ve been undertaking are also important levers to change in that business mix. And maybe Andy, if you don\u2019t mind, you could just sort of give a quick update on that. Andy Sullivan : Sure, Rob. Tom, good morning. So I\u2019ll make this very specific. So let\u2019s talk about annuity. So as we\u2019ve talked about step one in de-risking is the runoff and that started with ceasing of sales. So you saw this quarter where we only had 1% of our sales that came from traditional variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits. And we very successfully have pivoted over to FlexGuard, we will expect to see about a $3 billion per quarter runoff in that traditional variable annuity block of business. This quarter, we saw about $3.8 billion. As we pivoted to FlexGuard, we\u2019re putting into the market a very different type of product that better balances consumer value with shareholder value. And we could not be more pleased with the success of that product. We had a 14.5% market share back in 4Q and as you saw, our sales have continued to expand where we had $1.6 billion in sales this quarter. That is really coming off the strength of our brand and the strength of our distribution. And we\u2019re very happy with the returns and the risk profile of that new business that we\u2019re putting on the book. So it\u2019s a very good example of how step one is all about the runoff and pivot. Operator : Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo and your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : Hi. Thanks. My first question maybe following-up on Tom\u2019s question, just on the M&A side of things. So you guys mentioned PGIM and emerging markets as areas where you have book to deals. As you\u2019re executing on that plan can you just give us a sense of what you\u2019re seeing out there from the M&A perspective as you\u2019re kind of looking to execute there? Charlie Lowrey : Sure. Elyse, this is Charlie. Let me just take a step back if you will, and put what we\u2019re doing into context, and then I\u2019ll answer your specific question. As we look at the journey we\u2019re on, if you will, we as a management team are laser focused on three goals. Well, the first is to deliver strong and consistent performance. And hopefully you\u2019ve seen that. The second is to execute on the transformation that Rob and Andy just talked about, and there are three parts to that. One is pivoting our products to be less market sensitive and capital sensitive. The second is to execute on our cost efficiency goals. And you saw that we expanded our goals by 50% last year and are ahead of track. And the third is to lean into the higher growth markets as Rob talked about the reallocation of $5 billion to $10 billion of capital. So that\u2019s the second goal. The third goal is to be good stewards of capital, balancing the return of capital to shareholders with investing both organically and inorganically in our businesses. And we think that by achieving that balance, we can maximize shareholder value over time. So those are the three goals, strong and consistent performance, executing on our transformation and being good stewards of capital. And that will hopefully give you a framework around which we couldn\u2019t look at any of the actions that we take, including, as you talked about the programmatic M&A which Andy now can talk about. Andy Sullivan : Yes. So thanks, Charlie. And Elyse, I\u2019ll build upon it. So first, when it comes to PGIM, I\u2019d be remised if I didn\u2019t say that we\u2019ve had just great success organically growing this business. We\u2019ve seen somewhere in the neighbourhood of $55 billion in flows over the last five years due to the strength of our platform. And we will continue to invest in that organic growth. Having said that this is an area we\u2019ve identified where we want to augment through M&A, and we\u2019re \u2013 that all starts with being very clear on our priorities and clear on our spots. As we talked about last quarter, we\u2019re very interested in expanding upon our already good capabilities in alternatives as well as continuing to expand on our track record of success globally. Those are areas we\u2019re focused on because if you look at the overall asset management industry, they are faster growth areas of this space. As we\u2019re looking, everything and anything we look at would obviously we need to vet for a cultural fit and to make sure it fits with our multi-manager model. The way that I talked to my team and my team we talked about this as being in the flow and in the know. And what I mean by that is we need to make sure that we see all potential opportunities, both what\u2019s already in the marketplace, but what might be in the marketplace. And I could tell you that we are very confident that we are in the know and in the flow. We will be very programmatic and disciplined in deploying capital towards these acquisitions. And we are very confident that it will meaningfully add to PGIM over time. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. That\u2019s great. And my second question, in terms of the plans that you guys laid out exiting and the downsizing of businesses, it was all kind of focused on the U.S. individual solutions side of the house. But as we think about the workplace solutions, be that retirement or group and those businesses that if there was an opportunity via transaction to monetize some of the assets. Is that something that you would consider or are you still more focusing on annuities and life as you look to free up capital? Charlie Lowrey : It\u2019s Charlie, again, Elyse. We\u2019ve spoken about the fact that we\u2019ve taken a broad strategic review on our businesses within the context of having a business mix that is less market sensitive, less capital intensive and higher growth. And we\u2019re going to be really thoughtful and diligent about how we execute on the process with the goal of maximizing value for shareholders. So when there\u2019s more to report, we\u2019ll let you know. But we\u2019re in the process of doing that. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse and your line is open. Andrew Kligerman : Good morning, everyone. Just following-up on Elyse\u2019s question. If you could give a little more clarity on the full service retirement business, is that considered a core capital light business? Charlie Lowrey : So this is Charlie, Andrew. Again, we\u2019re not going to comment on any particular business. What I\u2019ll do is go back to our original premise, which is that we\u2019ve looked at all businesses, we\u2019re considering a business mix in totality. That\u2019s going to be higher growth, less capital intensive, less market intensive and less volatile over time. And we\u2019ve evaluated all our businesses within that context. And as we go through that process, as we make decisions and execute, you will be one of the first to know, along with all your other colleagues. Andrew Kligerman : Maybe you can \u2013 all right, let me know a little before then. But anyway \u2013 moving on to Assurance IQ, I mean, these revenues look phenomenally robust and yet this quarter you generated a pre-tax loss of $39 million. Could you give a sense of when you\u2019d liked to kind of turn the corner on profitability? Or is it still a little too early to say? Andy Sullivan : So Andrew, it\u2019s Andy, thank you for your question. First, let me make sure, I point out that, in this quarter, we had $10 million of one-time non-recurring expense. And just to give you that feel and a flavor for that. That as example, we ended a couple of vendor contracts in distribution as we\u2019re maturing our model, as far as the path we\u2019re on to drive the business toward it ultimate \u2013 our ultimate revenue and margin objectives, nothing has changed. We bought this business and platform for its long-term strategic capabilities that it provides us, both from expanding the addressable market, as well as for shifting our mix to a more fee oriented mix. So as such, we\u2019re investing and managing the business for the long-term, we continue to invest in broadening and deepening the product portfolio. We continue to invest in deepening and making a more capable the distribution system and the results in the quarter. You see evidence of that. I\u2019ll point back to what we said, last quarter, the key metric is revenue growth as we scale this platform up, and as you saw, we had 80% quarter-to-quarter revenue growth and had revenues grow in all lines. And so we have a plan, we\u2019re executing against it. We\u2019re seeing the metrics go the right way. We need to scale the platform and as such in the near term, we will see operating losses. Andrew Kligerman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. And your line is open. Ryan Krueger : Good morning. I noticed that you stopped breaking out the wellness implementation costs this quarter. Can you give us any context for why you did that? And also I guess as we look, if we think about the corporate segment losses of $1.5 billion for 2021, should we expect that to decline in the following years as implementation costs also decline? Ken Tanji : Okay. Ryan, it\u2019s Ken. We\u2019re making really good progress on our transformation and cost saving initiative and that\u2019s being driven by our transformation office and they\u2019re making great progress. We included the implementation costs that we expect this year in our estimated loss for corporate and other of $1.5 billion. So it\u2019s in there. And it\u2019s comparable to the amount that we had in 2020. At this stage, we don\u2019t expect the magnitude to vary significantly. So that\u2019s why we didn\u2019t feel the need to continue to separate and isolate it out. We are, as I mentioned, making very good progress towards our objective of achieving $750 million of cost savings by 2023. And over this period, we would expect to have implementation costs included in our corporate and the other segment to continue. Ryan Krueger : Thanks. And then on your retirement business, can you give us any rough breakdown since there\u2019s kind of multiple \u2013 couple of different businesses in your reporting segment? What\u2019s the rough breakdown in terms of varying contribution is from full service compared to institutional investment products? Ken Tanji : We have an excellent full service business. But it\u2019s part of our overall retirement segment. We haven\u2019t historically separated that out. It is part of that business line and we\u2019re not going to separate that, those specific are forward just the full service segment. Ryan Krueger : Got it. All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with Citi. And your line is open. Suneet Kamath : Great. Thanks. My first question is, I\u2019m just trying to reconcile something which is, at the 2019 Investor Day, we spent a lot of time on the financial wellness initiative and how you are tracking a lot of these meetings that you were hosting with the employees of your corporate customers. So I\u2019m trying to reconcile that strategy with comments that we\u2019re hearing today, that a lot of your U.S. businesses are under review, including the retirement business, because it felt to me that those two things were interconnected. So I\u2019m trying to figure out, is there a change in that financial wellness strategy or what\u2019s going on? Andy Sullivan : So Suneet, it\u2019s Andy, I\u2019ll take your question. Financial wellness absolutely remains a key component of our organic growth strategy in the company. As we articulated that at Investor Day, and as you heard me say, often, we\u2019re working to bring more solutions to more people and to address a broader swath of the American marketplace. That is both through the workplace, through the advisor channel and direct-to-consumer. As we talked about our financial wellness capability that we\u2019ve built out have really helped to activate a couple of value levers and the two predominant ones would be institutional value. And the second would be converting individuals in the workplace to long-term loyal customers of Prudential. We\u2019ve seen those value levers activated. We\u2019ve talked in the past about institutional value that\u2019s been delivered both from the net revenue growth in the group of insurance business, but also from the growth of our full service platform. And we are seeing the conversion to individual product sales from the financial wellness value prop. So you should think of it as, it is an important component of the organic piece of our strategy to grow and expand our addressable market. But it is that, it\u2019s a component of the broader strategy as we push to the business system to be higher growth, less capital intensive and less market sensitive. Suneet Kamath : Okay. And then on the capital reallocation, I think when we were talking about growth businesses last quarter. You\u2019ve highlighted three emerging markets PGIM and Assurance IQ. I think, Charlie, in your prepared remarks this morning, you didn\u2019t mention Assurance IQ. Should we take from that that you\u2019re currently not planning on allocating more capital to either Assurance IQ or other sort of insured tech types of operations? Charlie Lowrey : Yes, I think that\u2019s a fair comment. In other words, as we think about programmatic M&A, in particular as we\u2019ve talked about it this morning, it\u2019s investing primarily in our other businesses in the U.S. and international and what we mean by programmatic M&A, it\u2019s a very specific strategy. We\u2019re going to be highly selective and we\u2019re going to do targeted acquisitions that add either scale or augment capabilities to our existing businesses like PGIM and like emerging markets. Bob Falzon : Hey, Suneet, it\u2019s Rob. Though just add to Charlie\u2019s comments, which is to say that differentiate what would be the objective that we articulated was to have the combination of the three businesses that you mentioned equal to 30% of our earnings in the timetable that we had \u2013 that we had targeted. Then we separately said with regard to redeployment of capital, however that we were focused on PGIM and emerging markets, we did not at that point in time call out assurance as an area for capital deployment. Suneet Kamath : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. And your line is open. Erik Bass : Hi, thank you. Can you provide some more details on your current emerging markets businesses and where they stand in terms of scale and profitability? How much earnings are you generating from emerging markets today? And how do you expect that to grow organically over the next three years? Scott Sleyster : Thanks Eric. This is Scott. I\u2019ll go ahead and take that question. Well, first of all, from a big picture perspective, following the sale of Korea about 94%, 95% of our earnings come from Japan. So that\u2019s why we spend a lot of time focused on Japan. Within the emerging markets, I think, I\u2019ve said before that the bulk of the earnings from those from that sector comes from a combination of Brazil and in Chile. So the good news is in our emerging markets platform is that we feel like we\u2019re in a lot of the right countries. And we\u2019ve actually worked pretty hard to get the right partners in those countries where partners where we required. The challenge that we faced is that we originally started in a lot of those markets with tied agency or NLP model. And we\u2019ve now broadened that out at independent agency in bank assurance, but we\u2019re starting from a rather small platform. So, the good news is, we are seeing a rapid growth in the emerging markets, for example, our in-force grew at high single-digit in Brazil and in double-digit Mexico last year. But for most of our emerging markets, we\u2019re starting off of a rather small phase and that\u2019s why Charlie talks about it in the context of markets that we\u2019d like to grow. We tend to think we\u2019re in the right places. We have licenses and partners, and that\u2019s why we think a bolt-on strategy is probably the best strategy for growing those markets. Thanks. Erik Bass : Thank you. And then follow-up on sticking with the international businesses, in the Life Planner business, you continue to show healthy growth and Life Planner at POJ, but the total Life Planner counts down year-over-year. I\u2019m assuming the decline is coming from Brazil. This is hoping you could provide some more color on what\u2019s going on and what we should infer about the underlying growth trends in that business? Scott Sleyster : Yes. That\u2019s a good follow-up and your observation is correct. I believe, I commented last quarter, but we systemically or consistently kind of go through our LT models and we change our contract terms and we do that to maintain productivity, sometimes adapt to regulatory changes customer and regulatory needs and the like, and we did implement some new contract terms in Brazil last year, we were expecting a declined to follow that that in fact that did occur. And so that really was the change actually Japan Life Planner growth was actually up in POJ 4% year-over-year and that\u2019s our biggest market. In quarter-over-quarter we were back up slightly in Brazil. So, I would view that as kind of a contract related change. Further, I would say that if you look back three or four years ago in Brazil, almost all of our sales were coming from the Life Planner channel and we\u2019ve had a lot of growth in our bank segment. And increasingly we\u2019ve been making progress in our group segment, so that recently almost 30% of our sales have been coming from outside the Life Planner model. So, we\u2019re actually quite pleased with how things are going in Brazil. Thanks. Erik Bass : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next we would go to line of Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please. Go ahead. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Good morning everybody. My first question goes to the increasing the buyback authorization less so about I think, 2021, but the thought of seeing that $0.5 billion increase flow through here come through your targets. I just, conceptually, I want to maybe get your sense. Is that something that you think you\u2019ll be revisiting on a quarterly basis based on the performance of the company or is this kind of a one-off, how should we think of this new $10.5 billion target? Ken Tanji : Hi. This is Ken. We\u2019ve had a very consistent approach to capital management. We use both share purchases and dividend as a way to distribute capital to shareholders. We\u2019ve prioritized dividends and our earnings have been about three times dividends. Our free cash flow has been about 65% of our earnings, and about two times our dividend. So, while we seek to use dividends and grow them we\u2019ll use a level of share repurchases, but it will vary overtime. Our recent decision to increase that by $0.5 billion and again, just not just for 2021, but we also, as you mentioned, increased our three-year outlook. It really reflects where we are at this point in time with our capital position, as well as our outlook on the economy. And again, it\u2019s consistent with returning excess capital to the shareholders as time passes we will continue to reassess our capital position and determine if adjustments are appropriate. So again, it\u2019s really consistent with the approach we\u2019ve had for many years. And if we have excess capital we\u2019ll make the practice of share \u2013returning that to shareholders. Yaron Kinar : Okay. But a quarter ago you were also talking about the other pillar, which was the fact that $10 billion, if you deploy into shifting businessmen from in shifting to more capital structure. So, I\u2019m just trying to think of if this additional $0.5 billion is that need, that you\u2019re seeing less opportunity to deploy into shifting business mix or is it just that you identify more, that\u2019s a scaffold than you initially thought and therefore by increasing the other pillar? Ken Tanji : Yes, it\u2019s really a reflection of our current position of excess capital. As Rob mentioned, we\u2019re making great progress towards our objective of, of five to 10 billion of capital reallocation. And again, it\u2019s a wide range because we want \u2013 we will be disciplined about transactions to release and redeploy. So it\u2019s primarily the result of how we feel about our current capital position and the economic outlook. Yaron Kinar : Understood. And then my second question PGIM so clearly very strong net flows, but kind of tell \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say a story, but like you are seeing very, very robust retail flows, which I think is pretty consistent with what we are hearing in the market whereas institutional flows slowdown a little bit sequentially. And I think that that\u2019s, I don\u2019t know if I should call that a trend or not, but maybe any color you can give us in terms of what you\u2019re seeing in both institutional and retail. And, are you seeing trends there. Andy Sullivan : So, Yaron it\u2019s Andy, thanks for your question. Yes, I would not draw any conclusions or say we\u2019re seeing any trends. I guess the way we would frame it is, we are a very diversified business across our multi managers across both public and private sectors. We serve a very wide range of clients. The only thing I\u2019d say on the institutional side is obviously institutional clients can tend to be more lumpy and you\u2019ll get variability quarter-to-quarter versus on the retail side. On the retail side, we have seen a lot of money in, money markets. And we think that could be a tailwind coming, continuing to come into the marketplace, but more broadly we have a broad suite of products. And I think at the end of the day, we\u2019re very confident that we\u2019ll be a net winner from a flows perspective, given the strength and the balance that we have across product types and across institutional and retail. But to your question should you draw any trends or conclusions, I would say now. Yaron Kinar : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. And your line is open. Humphrey Lee : Good morning. And thank you for taking my questions. My first question is related to the time in general. I think in your 10-K, you indicated at the spread compression in your Full Service business is a key headwind to earnings for Retirement. Just looking back on the past couple of years on at least the past several quarters, in terms of the interest rates have been that you highlighted, how should we think about the portion of a spread compression in Full Service versus that in the IB business? Ken Tanji : Hey, Humphrey, it\u2019s Ken. We do see a spread compression in a Retirement business and that\u2019s a combination of Full Service in our institutional business, in the baseline roll forward that we provided. You\u2019ll see that of the $10 million impact half of that, or $5 million is in our Retirement segment. But we don\u2019t split that out between Full Service and an institutional. Humphrey Lee : I guess, kind of directionally, which one would you say will be have your thoughts of that? Ken Tanji : Yes. Again, we don\u2019t, want to get down to it. They get into the breakdown of that. Humphrey Lee : Okay. I guess that\u2019s just a follow-up, to just the fixed income portion of the business in general. How should we think about the capital that you have is currently backing the stable of this stable, valid business in Full Service? Ken Tanji : Again, with our Full Service business as part of our overall Retirement segment. That\u2019s where the earnings are reported in the capitals held, but we\u2019re not going to break down the split of it by sub segment. Humphrey Lee : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. And your line is open. Tracy Benguigui : Thank you. I\u2019m wondering if you could reconcile some comments made on one hand, you mentioned the emphasizing higher market and rate sensitive business, but on the other hand, Charlie, you mentioned previously that none of your businesses are secret cows, that you look at everything. So, it\u2019d just be helpful to understand, how open-ended you requested or if you have a pecking order in mind. Charlie Lowrey : Thanks Tracy for the question. Yes, we \u2013 I\u2019ll just go back to what I said before, which is we have looked and are looking at all our businesses. Our objective is to create and maximize shareholder value overtime. We\u2019re not going to talk about a pecking order if you will, of businesses at this time, but rest assured that we\u2019re looking carefully at all our businesses and understanding specifically how they fit into an overall business mix and the objective that we articulated in the first quarter, which was to expand our higher growth businesses and to reduce annuities and our market sensitive to a smaller extent. So that\u2019s, about all we want to say at this point about we\u2019re in the process of doing that. And as I said before you all will know when there\u2019s more to report. Tracy Benguigui : Okay, understood. You go to a different topic. I mean, there\u2019s a lot of talk about COVID-19, but I\u2019m wondering if you had experienced better non-COVID-19 mortality losses for the quarter. I understand the first quarter is usually a heavy full quarter, but looking at CDC data looks like excess mortality, ex-COVID was unusually low. Did you have that experience? Bob Falzon : Hey, Tracy, this is certainly an unusual stretch of time during the pandemic. But generally we did not see any significant or credible trend or variance in our underwriting experience other than what seems to be related to COVID. So really can\u2019t give you any other comments other than that. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of John Barnidge with Piper Sandler. And your line is open. John Barnidge : Thank you very much. And don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not a question about risk transfers. So, I was curious with some short-term disability claims seemingly than to going to long-term disability, because of the natural things that occur with economic shock lapses, a few quarters out. Can you talk about your expectations with that as well as associated elevated administrative expenses? Andy Sullivan : Sure. John it\u2019s Andy, and appreciate the new topic to cover. So, as you would expect last year given the impact of COVID in the pandemic, we absolutely saw an increase in short term disability claims. We\u2019ve actually seen those claims volumes coming back down, obviously it\u2019s a pandemic, it\u2019s getting more to control of vaccines and the like. We continue to expect you know, due to our experience, the impact on the economy to have an effect on long-term disability claim incident. We have not seen that tick up as of yet that, that does not necessarily mean that we won\u2019t there\u2019s generally a six month period on the long-term disability plan. That\u2019s why you saw us put up an idea in our last quarter and we put up an additional IBNR this quarter. So we\u2019re, still expecting that and that directly flows to your question about increased administrative expenses. One of the things that we consider, very, very important to managing this business is having the right number of claims professionals, nurses, and folks specialists. We have beefed up our staffing and in the claims part of the business to be ready to properly help individuals return to work that go on long-term disability claims. And you\u2019re seeing that reflected in the elevated admin ratio. Operator : And will that do it for you, John? John Barnidge : Sorry, I was on mute. Thank you. A follow-up to that related to it. Do you think the corporate push knock through but industry-wide to return to office, June say the summer to fall may actually add another layer dynamic to that long-term disability dynamic? Andy Sullivan : So John, it\u2019s Andy, I\u2019ll take your question. That\u2019s a really hard one to predict and where our thoughts go in that is we have a very diversified book of business across size, segments and geographies. And I think the patterns of what we\u2019re going to see from a return to the workplace perspective are going to be pretty varied across those different industry size, segments and geography. So really hard to tell, what influence that might have on the disability claims incidents. John Barnidge : Thank you very much for your answers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America, and your line is open. Josh Shanker : Yes. Thank you for slipping me in here at the end. Two quick ones, I think the first one is obviously first quarter was very interesting from an industry perspective move and it affected the mark-to-market results, if the PGIM strategies in a negative sort of way. I guess I\u2019m look \u2013 there might be an argument that industries reform is in tuned arrived, probably not that it didn\u2019t first quarter, but does PGIM have the right set of strategy to entertain inflows in a rising industry and economy that PGIM customers will embrace? Andy Sullivan : So Josh, it\u2019s Andy. Thanks for your question. So yes, as you\u2019re referring to, if we were to see a consistently rising rate environment that very likely has an impact on fixed income flows in general across the space and couldn\u2019t impact growth for that sector. But I\u2019d go back to something I said earlier, which is, we\u2019re a top 10 asset manager with a very broad and well-diversified portfolio in both public and private and in any economic environment, we feel that we\u2019ll be a net winner across those set of businesses from a net flows perspective. So yes, we feel very well positioned. And then obviously I\u2019d be remiss, if I didn\u2019t add, remember rise \u2013 a rising rate environment overall is a net positive for Prudential. Josh Shanker : Yes. I understand that. And to just understand the financial advisor, new sales on the annuity side of the business. Obviously the buffered annuity sales has been very strong. But I just want to break down, if I have a variable annuity with living benefits with Prudential, can I keep contributing into it? And how much of the new sales are legacy living benefits to customers who are putting more money into their older policies? Andy Sullivan : Yes. So again, it\u2019s Andy; thanks for the question. So depending on the product, depending on the regulatory territory, there are various rules on what we call those sub pays, how much additional money could be dropped into the policies. We have actually closed off to the jury, we\u2019re able and it is to a large degree sub pace going into those products. That\u2019s why when we report that only 1% is in the traditional variable annuities that guaranteed living benefit that is reflective of the sub pace as well. So when we\u2019re really talking about runoff, those products truly are not only sales to new customers, but additional monies being dropped in, it really is a hard stop on. Josh Shanker : Okay, Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will go to a follow-up from Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. And your line is open. Tom Gallagher : Thanks. Andy, just a follow-up on the buffer annuity sales, which are now the majority of your annuity sales, that\u2019s obviously a very big pivot into that product. Can you talk a bit about the risk profile of that business, the capital intensity of this product compared to your legacy VA business and why you obviously feel a lot of confidence with this volume of sales, if you\u2019re looking to exit legacy VA? But maybe just to compare and contrast about why you have confidence and clarity on the risk profile there? Andy Sullivan : Yes Tom, So it\u2019s Andy, and maybe I\u2019ll take sort of two sides to that question, risk and return. From the risk perspective, the product is vastly different from our traditional variable annuities, like the highest daily income. If you think about it, we\u2019re sharing risk with the consumer, we\u2019re giving them a buffer on the downside for a little bit of upside, but they have detailed downside risk, and obviously the upside is Kat, so at the end of the day, we\u2019re not taking interest rate risks like we were in HDI, the interest rate risk because of the design of the product could be nearly perfectly hedged with simple options. So the risk profile we\u2019re very, very comfortable with \u2013 from a go-forward perspective. Your question around returns, I think what I talked about in previous quarters, we did a lot of work to be able to more rapidly price our products and adjust our product pricing. We\u2019re quite pleased with the returns that we\u2019re seeing on the business that we\u2019re selling. And obviously that might be begging the question of, well, why have you been so successful? So let me hit that, number one, we are one of the very best and top brands in the space with a lot of history through the third-party advisor channels. Number two, we have great distribution people in relationships, inclusive of Prudential Advisors, which is a very big strategic advantage for us. And that has led to the sales results and the very, very positive results. But we liked the risk profile and we liked to return. Rob Axel : Hey Tom, it\u2019s Rob, just to add onto one thing to Andy said, you talked about the interest rate risk profile, it just implied in his comments as well, just to make sure it\u2019s clear. The equity risk profile is also quite low, we\u2019re able to \u2013 the structure of the buffer is something that we\u2019re able to actively hedge with options in the marketplace. So we\u2019re not taking that equity market risk on ourselves. Thanks. Tom Gallagher : Okay. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. And with that, Mr. Lowrey, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to you for any closing comments. Charlie Lowrey : Thank you very much. So thank you for your time and interest today. I hope we\u2019ve conveyed the increased sense of momentum and the steady progress around our transformation initiatives. We remain confident in our strategy and the additional steps we\u2019re taking to build a nimbler and higher growth business, and one which continues to focus on the evolving needs of our customers. We look forward to sharing more details on our progress with you in the coming quarters. And thank you again for joining us today. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I'll hand it over to Charlie. Charlie Lowrey : Thank you, Darin, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. As always, we hope you and your families remain safe and healthy. We reported strong financial results for the second quarter, reflecting robust investment performance and further progress in achieving our cost savings target. We also made significant progress executing on our strategy to become a higher growth, less market-sensitive, and more nimble Company. As an example, we announced an agreement to sell our full-service retirement business last month. Second, our cost-savings program is progressing well and is ahead of our original plan. And third, with the support of our rock-solid balance sheet, we are thoughtfully redeploying capital, both by increasing capital return to shareholders and by selectively pursuing acquisition opportunities. I'll now provide an update on each of these strategic initiatives beginning with our recent divestiture activity. Turning to Slide 3. Following the sale of our Korea business last year, we successfully closed on the sale of our Taiwan business during the second quarter. And in July, we announced an agreement to sell our full-service retirement business to Empower Retirement, in a transaction which is expected to close in the First Quarter of 2022. Including the announced full-service sale and the completed sales of our Korea and Taiwan businesses, we expect net proceeds of approximately $4.2 billion from these divestitures. Meanwhile, we continue to pursue opportunities to reduce the size of our legacy block of traditional variable annuities, with guaranteed living benefits. Moving to Slide 4. As I mentioned earlier, we are progressing well, and remain on track to generate $750 million of cost savings by the end of 2023. To date, we have achieved 515 million of run-rate cost savings, which exceeded our original target of 500 million, and did so 18 months ahead of plan. These savings include $130 million in the second quarter and a total of 240 million for the first half of 2021. We've also identified new cost savings to replace those we had not yet realized in our full-service retirement business. And as a result, continue to expect to generate $750 million of cost savings. Turning to Slide 5, these initiatives are complemented by our thoughtful approach to capital redeployment, including through increased shareholder distributions. Last month, when announcing our agreement to sell the full-service retirement business, we increased our share repurchase authorization by an additional $500 million, our second increase of this amount since the beginning of 2021. This brings our total shareholder distributions to a targeted $11 billion through the end of 2023, up from the 10 billion target we initially identified earlier this year. Year-to-date, we've returned $2.2 billion to shareholders, including 1.3 billion in the second quarter, comprised of 875 million in share buybacks and 460 million in dividend payments. In addition, consistent with our disciplined approach to capital management and guided by our philosophy of being prudent stewards of shareholder capital, we intend to reduce leverage and enhance our financial flexibility by redeeming $900 million of outstanding debt in the third quarter. Meanwhile, we are being disciplined in executing on our programmatic M&A opportunities as we have done in the past, with a focus on higher-growth areas, including asset management and emerging markets. As evidence of this, earlier this year our Africa joint-venture partner closed on a minority stake in ICEA LION Holdings, a highly respected financial service market leader in Kenya, with operations in Tanzania and Uganda. More recently in July, PGIM announced a deal to acquire Montana Capital Partners, a European-based private equity secondaries asset manager, which will enhance PGIM\u2019s capabilities and further expand its $250 billion alternatives platform. These transactions are consistent with our strategy to add capabilities in PGIM and deepen our presence in emerging markets, enhancing our growth opportunity. Our capital deployment is supported by our rock-solid balance sheet, including highly liquid assets of $4.9 billion at the end of the second quarter, and AA financial strength capital levels at our primary business subsidiaries. Before turning it over to Rob, I'd like to provide an update on our environmental, social, and governance commitments, which are integral to our business strategy and purpose of solving the financial challenges of our changing world. This Quarter, I'll focus on our environmental commitments. Last month, we took an important next step to integrate our ESG and financial frameworks, with the renewal of a standing $4 billion credit facility, which now directly links our financing costs to our progress in meeting previously established sustainability targets. These targets include reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, as well as improving diverse representation among our senior ranks. We also continued to make strong progress against other goals outlined in our 2019 Global Environmental Commitment, including investing in sustainable companies and projects, issuing our inaugural green bond last year, and by providing greater transparency around our general account investment allocations. We are also reducing our reliance on paper documentation both internally and in the volume of letters and other mailings shared with our customers. In partnership with American Forests, we aspire to significantly reduce our paper use by the end of 2022. We are committed to ensuring that sustainability runs through everything we do at Prudential. This also includes fulfilling the 9 commitments to advance racial equity that we established one year ago this week, which are in addition to our ongoing diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. I look forward to updating you next quarter on the progress of this work as well as on our other social commitments. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for more specific details on our business performance. Robert Falzon : Thanks, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for PGIM, U.S. and International Businesses. I'll begin on Slide 6 of our financial results for the second quarter. Our pre-tax adjusted operating income was $1.9 billion, or $3.79 per share on an after-tax basis, and reflected the benefit of strong markets, business growth, and lower than typical expenses, which exceeded the net mortality impacts from COVID-19. PGIM, our Global Asset Manager had record asset management fees, driven by record account values of $1.5 trillion that were offset by lower other related revenues, driven by a decrease in seed and co-investment income, and higher expenses supporting business growth. Our U.S. business results were more than double the year-ago quarter and reflected higher net investment spread results, driven by higher variable investment income, higher fee income, primarily driven by equity market appreciation, and a more favorable impact from our annual assumption update, partially offset by less favorable underwriting experience, driven by COVID-19 -related mortality. And earnings in our international business have increased 16%, reflecting continued business growth, higher net investment spread results, lower expenses, and a more favorable impact of the annual assumption update. This increase was partially offset by lower earnings from required co-investment in our Chilean pension joint venture, and less favorable underwriting results, primarily driven by higher COVID-19 claims in Brazil. Turning to Slide 7, PGIM continues to demonstrate the strength of its diversified active management platform as a top 10 Global Investment Manager. PGIM\u2019s diversified global investment capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, alternatives, real estate, and equities positioned us favorably to capture flows. In addition, PGIM\u2019s investment performance remains attractive, with more than 93% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last three, five and ten year periods. Our diversified capabilities and strong investment performance helped to contribute to more than $5 billion of third-party net flows during the quarter, driven by continued strong public fixed income flows, with $5.6 billion of institutional flows partially offset by modest retail outflows. These retail outflows reflected continued positive inflows into PGIM's mutual funds, offset by outflows from sub-advisory mandates in U.S. equities As the investment engine of Prudential, PGIM also benefits from a mutually beneficial relationship with our U.S. and international insurance businesses. PGIM 's asset origination capabilities and investment management expertise provide a competitive advantage, helping our businesses to bring enhanced solutions and more value to our customers. And our businesses in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated flows that complement a successful third-party track record of growth. PGIM's asset management fees increased 16% compared to the year-ago quarter to a record level, as a result of market appreciation and continued positive third-party net flows. This contributed the PGIM's adjusted operating margin of 33%, which is above our expectation of 30% across the cycle. Now, turning to Slide 8. Our U.S. businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investments spread, and underwriting income, and benefit from our complimentary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to strengthen our businesses, transform our cost structure, and expand our addressable markets, while shifting away from low-growth, capital intensive, and interest rate sensitive products and businesses. Our product debits have worked well, demonstrated by continued strong sales of our buffered annuity, FlexGuard, which was $1.5 billion in the second quarter, representing 87% of total individual annuity sales. Over the past three quarters, FlexGuard sales have totaled $4.3 billion. These sales reflect customer demand for investment solutions that offer the potential for appreciation from equity markets combined with downside protection. We've exercised discipline through frequent pricing actions and our sales continue to benefit from having a strong and trusted brand and highly effective distribution team. Our Individual Life sales continued to be strong with higher Variable Life sales compared to the year-ago quarter, offset by lower sales of other policies, in particular, Universal Life sales, consistent with our product pivot strategy. In Group Insurance, financial wellness capabilities are core to our business success, and continue to differentiate our value proposition, enhanced benefit participation, and accelerate growth in our targeted markets. With respect to Assurance, total revenues, our primary financial metric as we concentrate on scaling the business, grew up 92% over the prior-year quarter. I would also note that similar to last year, we plan to increase the number of agents in the Third Quarter to help meet the seasonally higher expected demand of the Medicare annual enrollment period that occurs in the Fourth Quarter. Turning to Slide 9. Our international businesses include our Japanese life insurance operation where we have a differentiated multi-channel distribution model as well as other operations focused on high-growth markets. Sales across both Life Planner and Gibraltar operations held up well amidst the state of emergency in Japan. Life Planner sales were 49% higher than the year-ago quarter, while Gibraltar sales were 33% higher than the prior year. We remain encouraged by the resiliency of our unique distribution capabilities which have helped to continue the growth of our in-force business. And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken. Ken Tanji : Thanks, Rob. I'll begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the Third Quarter of 2021, relative to our Second Quarter results. Pre-tax adjusted operating income in the Second Quarter was 1.9 billion, and resulted in earnings per share of $3.79 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense of how our Third Quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items. First, our annual assumption update and other refinements resulted in a net charge of 34 million in the Second Quarter. Next, Variable Investment income outperformed expectations in the Second Quarter by 365 million. Third, underwriting experience is adjusted by a net 30 million. This adjustment includes a placeholder for COVID-19 claims experienced in the Third Quarter of 25 million for our U.S. businesses, based on 30,000 COVID-19 related fatalities in the U.S. and 20 million for our international businesses. While we have provided this placeholder for COVID-19 related underwriting experience for the Third Quarter, the actual impact will depend on a variety of factors such as infection and fatality rates, geographic concentration, and the continued acceptance and effectiveness of the vaccine. Fourth, we expect earnings will be lower in the Third Quarter by 290 million, primarily due to the timing of expenses between the Second and Third Quarters. And the make-whole fee of approximately 90 million associated with a previously announced redemption of 900 million of debt in the Third Quarter. This also includes the reduction in adjusted operating income from the sale of our full-service business, which will be reclassified to a divested business, as well as retained costs that will be reported in corporate and other. Last, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by about 10 million, reflecting the difference between new money rates and disposition yields of our investment portfolio. These items combined, get us to a baseline of $2.59 per share for the Third Quarter. I'll note that if we exclude items specific to the Third Quarter, earnings per share would be $3. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power has increased from last quarter, as the benefits from business growth, our cost savings program, and higher equity markets, more than offset the reduction in earnings from the sale of the full-service business. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the third quarter. I would also note that with the debt make-whole fee and retained cost of Full Service, we now expect the full-year 2021 corporate and other loss to be about 1.65 billion. Turning to Slide 11. We continue to maintain a robust capital position inadequate sources of funding. Our capital position continues to support a AA financial strength rating and we have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets were 4.9 billion, which is greater than 3 times annual fixed charges. And other sources of funds include free cash flow from our businesses and other contingent capital facilities. The redemption of debt, as previously mentioned, will complete our plan to reduce financial leverage in 2021 and generate annual interest savings of approximately 30 million, while also enhancing our financial flexibility for the future as we execute on our strategic transformation. Turning to Slide 12 and in summary. We are executing on divestitures. We are ahead of schedule on cost-saving initiatives, and with the support of our rock-solid balance sheet, we are thoughtfully redeploying capital. Now, I'll turn it to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [ Operator instructions]. And we do ask of you, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. And first we have the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW, please go ahead. Ryan Krueger : Hi. Good morning. Could you provide an update on your progress toward a variable annuity transaction, and also I think in the past you had commented that the market tended to be interested in 1 billion to 2 billion in size VA transactions, also curious if that's still the case? Andy Sullivan : Hi, Ryan. Good morning. It's Andy. I'll take your question. Let me start by reiterating what Charlie said in his prepared remarks at the top. We are committed to significantly reducing the earnings contribution from traditional variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits. And as you remember, we talked about this is a two-step process. Step 1 is run-off. And we expect about 40% to 45% of the earnings reduction will come from run-off. And we're executing on what we consider to be a highly successful pivot. If you look at this quarter, we had 0% of our sales in those legacy products, those traditional variable annuities, and we experienced 3.8 billion in run-off in those products in the quarter. And we've pivoted to products that are much better balanced, consumer value with shareholder value, and obviously FlexGuard being the chassis product there, where we saw a 17% market share in the First Quarter and we were the number 2 provider of Index Variable Annuity. So step one is all about runoff. And now having said that, step two is a transaction, and conducting a transaction does remain a priority for us. We have work in progress, and we're progressing that work forward. As you noted, I would say the 1 billion to 2 billion range, if you look at the transactions that have been done in the marketplace is a good precedent, and I would say that we continue to see tailwinds of capital coming towards the space. As we've articulated before, we have a very high-quality block of business. As always, as we continue to progress, we are going to be disciplined to make sure we only do things that are shareholder-friendly and have the right economics, much like you saw us do with the full-service transaction. So we're going to keep moving down the tracks and we will share when we have something more to share. Ryan Krueger : Thank you. And a follow-up is, other than variable annuities, but you've already said there in the full-service retirement sale, are there any other businesses that you'd consider divesting at this point? Charlie Lowrey : Hi Ryan, it's Charlie. As Andy said, and as I said in my opening remarks, we're making significant progress. I think executing on becoming a higher growth, less market sensitive, and more nimble business. And this includes the announced full-service sale, but also the completed sales of some of the things we've done before, including the sale of our Korea, Taiwan, Italy, and Poland businesses. So we'll continue to pursue opportunities to reduce the size of our legacy block, as Andy said, of traditional variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits, but as we've noted in the past, we're looking at life insurance blocks of business as well. So we've accomplished a significant amount, but we still have a lot more work to do, and we're going to be very thoughtful about how we execute on the dual goals of fulfilling our purpose, on the one hand, and creating value for shareholders on the other. Ryan Krueger : Thank you. Operator : Our next question's from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Erik Bass : Hi. Thank you. Last night, we saw another jumbo PRT transaction, and one of your competitors was talking about this being potentially a record year for industry volumes and Pru\u2019s historically been the dominant competitor in the jumbo market. But now we're seeing some others take the lead. So I was just hoping you could talk about your appetite for PRT business going forward and the competitive dynamics in the market currently. Andy Sullivan : Thanks, Erik. This is Andy, I'll take your question. And thank you for your recognition. We absolutely have been a pioneer and a leader in the space of pension risk transfer. We have a great brand, we have very strong capabilities, and we believe that we have a unique and distinguished track record of execution. We also are seeing strong market opportunity. The market size in second quarter was about 4.5 billion, that was similar to what we saw in the first quarter. We expect the back half of the year to be very healthy. The average funding rate is 99% and sponsors still have a high desire to transact. That being said, this has become a more competitive market, both from the perspective of the number of competitors competing in it but also the number of competitors that are seeking larger and larger deals. Very consistent to what we've told you in the past, we're going to be disciplined in our approach, and we're going to pick our spots, and that is what you're seeing from us, and you should expect to see quarter-to-quarter variation. But if you combine the strong pipeline that we see going forward with the strength of our business, number one, we feel comfortable we could take this approach, and number two, we expect that we'll be a net winner over time and experience good flows. Erik Bass : Thank you. And then for -- next question is, you highlighted two examples of programmatic M&A that you've done year-to-date. Can you give a sense of how capital was allocated to these transactions, and will deals of this size be enough to meet your capital reallocation targets, or do you expect [Indiscernible]? Charlie Lowrey : We've been on that one, we're not going to talk about the specific size of some of these transactions, but it is fair to say that we are taking a very disciplined approach and balanced approach to M&A, and that with programmatic M&A you can expect us to do more of this type of deal going forward. Erik Bass : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Next, we'll go to Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead. Humphrey Lee : Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Just a follow-up on M&A. I understand some of the transactions you have done year-to-date, but just thinking about the impact of the full-service sale and the stranded cost being left behind. Is the priority going to be something focus more on the mature businesses that provide more solid earnings so that you can absorb and offset the stranded costs from the full-service sale? Charlie Lowrey : Yeah. Humphrey, it's Charlie. Let me take that one. First of all, again, we're going to take a very disciplined and balanced approach to this, but when we think about acquisitions, we think about them both from a strategic and a financial perspective. So from a strategic perspective, we look to add capabilities such as product or distribution or increased scale in a market or country. And from a financial standpoint, we look at a variety of metrics when assessing potential acquisitions and that can be earnings contribution, it can be growth. It's going to be a number of factors that we consider. But most importantly, our focus is on becoming a higher-growth, less market-sensitive, and more nimble business. And we're going to continue to be very thoughtful and disciplined about how we execute, with the goal of creating value for shareholders. Ken Tanji : And maybe, Charlie, I'll just add. In terms of, Humphrey, what you described as stranded cost or the retained cost from the transaction, as we've demonstrated across the company, we've made excellent progress in transforming our operations, gaining efficiencies, but also including capabilities. We have an institutionalized process and structure and it's accelerating our progress on our cost objectives. We're focused on meeting the cost-saving objectives of 750 million by 2023, and as we reallocate and redeploy capital, we'll look to reallocate overhead across our businesses as well. Humphrey Lee : Got it. Shifting gears, you talked about using some of the proceeds from the full-service sale to lower your leverage. Can you just talk about the rationale behind the decision since the sale doesn't really trigger any issue with your leverage, especially given the expected gain from the sale? Ken Tanji : Humphrey, this is really part of our regular review of capital and liquidity profile. And given our current position, we thought it was a good time to redeem the debt. That redemption will have a near-term earnings benefit, but it's also going to provide debt capacity and flexibility for the future. So it really just reflects, we thought it was a good way and a good time to reduce our debt in an efficient way. Humphrey Lee : Okay, so I shouldn't read it as like a potential VA transaction that may have an impact on your book value or you may be, more leaning towards, [Indiscernible] down the road, but it periodic, your regular review and just fine is a good term right now. Ken Tanji : Exactly. I don't -- I wouldn't connect it directly to any specific transaction. It's -- we're overall regularly reviewing where we are and we thought it was a smart thing to do. Humphrey Lee : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Andrew Kligerman : Hey, good morning. I'm thinking about Assurance IQ and that superb 92% year-over-year growth in revenue. But then you had a loss pre-tax of about 38 million, which was up materially year-over-year. Could you talk a little bit about, A, the growth rate? Can you keep at this pace? And, B, when might we think about a timeframe for when you get to breakeven? Andy Sullivan : So thanks Andrew, it's Andy, I'll take your question. As we've discussed in the past, we're very intentionally building out the business and the platform. And we're doing that because as we brought this business into Prudential, we saw just real opportunity and incredible customer demand. We saw again 7 million shoppers in the Quarter, and we're looking at hundreds of thousands of policies that we're going to have sold, and these are customers that we would have never reached at Prudential, so very much part of expanding our addressable market. As you look at those investments, there is, I'll call it a J-curve to those investments, whereas we're adding agents as an example, they will become more and more productive over time. And a number of these investments are fixed expense. So that's why we say the predominant metric is scale. We have to scale up to -- I'll use the word overcome that sixth expense. And we're seeing great progress. You know that we're also -- we're very pleased with the 112 million and the 92% growth rate. We believe that we have a lot of continued room in front of us to grow, to specifically answer your question. As to a specific timeframe around achieving the long-term economics, we're not going to provide more exact guidance. Andrew Kligerman : Yeah, that was helpful. And the buffered annuity markets. So now that was I think 87% of your total segment sales there. Do you see a point where you could get to the volumes even of what you were doing on the Legacy products, and how do you see the competition there? It seems like a lot of players have been jumping into the buffered annuity market, is that going to impede your growth? Andy Sullivan : Thanks for the question on the buffered annuity market and on FlexGuard. Let me start by saying, the driver of our success has a lot to do with; we're a very well established brand that's very well-respected, we have just an outstanding distribution system and distribution partners, and we came to market with a very differentiated product from the indexing strategy perspective. All of that has enabled us to have one of the best launches in probably the history of the industry. So we're very, very proud of it. The market itself is growing. So we're seeing more and more volume industry-wide shift from more traditional-type product designs over to the index variable annuity area. And I would think of this as more of a chassis. It's really a pretty broad area of accumulation-oriented products that have upside and downside buffering. So we see a good bit of room still to run. Having said that, we have at this time rolled it out to all of our third-party relationships and we're in all of our key geographies. So quite pleased with how we've done. As far as its ability to get to some of the very high levels that we saw have 5-10 years ago, I'm not going to put a prediction on that. Andrew Kligerman : Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question is from Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Please go ahead. Tracy Benguigui : Thank you. I have another Assurance IQ question. It looks like there is a changing of the guard, I understand the original founders are not there anymore, and have left before a potential earn-out, which would have been on meeting performance targets anyway. What is the new strategic direction under new management that we should anticipate? Andy Sullivan : Thanks Tracy, it's Andy. Let me hit the tail end of your question first. There is zero change in strategic direction or change in strategy with the Assurance platform, and with Prudential and what we're trying to accomplish. As you would expect, we have been adding to the team and deepening the talent as the business matures. You rightly identified the top of the house, Mike Rowell, a founder, has moved over to a Strategic Advisor role to me, that enables me to take a broader use of his experience and expertise. In addition to that, we promoted Allison Arzeno, who was the Chief Data Scientist, to be the CEO. I'm very excited by that. She is a fantastic leader and has jumped in and has continued the momentum. The other thing I mentioned is we've been very pleased that through the combination of Prudential 's brand and the unique and attractiveness of the insurance platform, we've been able to attract top, top industry talent specific for -- specifically for our product P&L roles. As an example, we recruited a gentleman by the name of Chris [Indiscernible], who has deep health expertise both in Core Health but also was a key leader at eHealth, and he's leading our Under 65 Health and Medicare Advantage. So we're pleased with the talent situation and we're confident that we have the right team and the right talent to take it forward. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. Great. Maybe moving onto your assumption update, I see that you did not change your long-term rate assumption, and I get that interest rates are at a higher spot now than this time last year. But I guess my thinking was that ensures we still want to grade into lower version in the main assumption to prepare for LDTI. Is that part of your thinking at all or is it more near-term when you conducted your review? Ken Tanji : Hi, Tracy. It's Ken. As you know, we've talked about we have a very established process for studying our long-term rate assumptions. And in doing so, we look at a variety of forecasts for long-term rates both internally and externally. And when we did that this year, we saw very little movement in those forecasts, and therefore, we didn't see it appropriate to change our long-term rate assumptions. So we look at it very consistently the way we've done it in the past. In terms of long duration target improvements, that's still a year-and-a-half away, we're making great progress in implementing that, and we'll be ready to adopt that on time, but it won't be a transition, it's an adoption date, and that's the method that we think is appropriate. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Next, we'll go to Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Tom Gallagher : Hey Charlie, when you mentioned you were looking at life insurance risk transfer deals as well as VA, can you provide a little bit of color on the process here? Is that a dual-track process where you're simultaneously looking at both VA and life deals, so you could get either/or transaction and the timing is unclear between the two, or any way of sort of handicapping whether you're more likely to do life insurance or a VA first? And then just relatedly, now that you do have those two lines, you're looking specifically at doing risk transfer on, are we now looking closer to maybe the high end of the 5 billion to 10 billion of freeing up of capital that you guys had laid out? Charlie Lowrey : Let me start and then Rob can elaborate. So right now we've said that we're at 4.2 billion if you include Korea, Taiwan, and the full-service business. We won't make predictions, we've said 5 to 10 because we're going to take a very prudent approach to doing this. We don't have to do anything, but if it makes sense for shareholders, we will do things and we'll see where we fall out in there, but that's an intentionally wide band. In terms of annuities versus life insurance. I think we have said that we are we're focused on annuities right now, but we will also think about life insurance as we go forward. Rob, do you want to add to that? Robert Falzon : Just Tom, that we have distinct teams focused on each of those initiatives, but as Charlie indicated, the more important initiative from the standpoint of the impact we believe on valuation to shareholders and overall valuation to the Company, is to get the VA transaction done first. And so it's been a priority, but not necessarily to the detriment of having resources that are dedicated to looking at the opportunities within the life sector as well. Tom Gallagher : Okay. That's helpful, guys. Thanks. Just a quick follow-up. The -- based on the guidance you'd given out for 3Q, it looks like you're estimating virtually all of the COVID impacts are going to come on group and not individual life. Is that what you saw in this quarter also? And you can provide a little color about what you're seeing from COVID impacts for group versus individual. Andy Sullivan : Yeah. Tom, it's Andy. I'll take your question. We saw in second-quarter COVID mortality impacts in both individual life insurance and group insurance. And going forward for 3Q, similarly, overall we estimate that we will continue to see impact from COVID mortality in both group insurance and in life, but I would note that that COVID impact in trend is beginning to moderate as we go into 3Q. I think what you're picking up there in ILI is the COVID impact is being partially offset by the fact that the Third Quarter is the highest Quarter for our seasonal underwriting results. So that's why that looks a little different in the exhibit. Scott Sleyster : Tom, this is Scott. On the international front, we're continuing to see really modest impacts across the board in Japan. We are seeing more of our impact in our Brazil operations, and similar to the U.S., we are seeing a mix across both group and individual lines. Tom Gallagher : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : And next we'll go to Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, when you guys announced the full-service sale, you did up your buyback by 500 million for this year. So as we think about additional transactions with CDA and perhaps life insurance, should we think about some portion of the capital potentially going to incremental repurchases, as well as for the M&A bucket? Charlie Lowrey : Elyse, it's Charlie. I'll take your question. We've said all along we want to be good stewards of capital. And we have and will continue to demonstrate disciplined and a balanced approach to the redeployment of capital within our businesses and to our shareholders, so that's the overriding concept. And to date, we've already returned a significant amount of capital to shareholders. We've returned over $2 billion and have increased both the dividend and the share repurchase authorization. So we plan over the next 3 years or through the end of 2023, to return $11 billion of capital. But stepping back, let me share with you how we think about capital allocation, and in particular optimization of that capital. Because we look across all our businesses, both domestically and internationally, to ensure that we're optimizing capital deployment, and we'll continue to look for ways to optimize that capital to maximize outcomes for shareholders. And as we've stated, to the extent we cannot find attractive capital deployment opportunities to meet our strategic and financial criteria, then we'll return excess capital to shareholders as you've seen us do in the past. Elyse Greenspan : That's helpful. And then, when we think about corporate costs, I guess I'm thinking more of beyond 2020 and -- 2021, sorry, into 2022 and 2023. Can you give us a sense of how corporate costs could come in as we think about both implementation costs and how we should see those trending in the outyears, and then also the [Indiscernible] from the Full Service Retirement Business? I know the guide. So there's 1.5 billion in life up this year, but how should we think about corporate costs over the next couple of years? Ken Tanji : Elyse, it's Ken. As I mentioned earlier, we're making great progress with our transformation effort, including gaining efficiencies, and it is a ongoing and institutionalized and continuous improvement process at this point. So we continue to expect to make progress towards our 750 million cost savings objective by 2023, and we think we're well on track to continue with that. Again, as we reallocate capital and redeploy capital, we'll reallocate some of our overhead costs, and you can expect that to continue as well. So Overall, we continue to make good progress with our cost objectives. I think you should expect us to continue to make progress like we have in the past. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And the next question's from John Barnidge with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. John Barnidge : Thank you. With the group disability loss ratio coming down for 2 straight quarters, how should we be thinking about the relationship with the administrative expense ratio, as that's been elevated for a few quarters to handle those increased cases? Andy Sullivan : So thanks, John. It's Andy. As you rightly noted, we have had enhanced staffing levels in our group insurance business. I think we talked about this on previous quarters. Given the nature of the pandemic and the morbidity effects, we have seen an enhanced level of [Indiscernible] and absence claims, and we've been maintaining higher staffing levels to make sure that we provide the right level of service. We also have been making sure that we maintain our long-term disability claims staff at higher levels. So you're definitely seeing that as a contributor to the elevated administrative ratio. The other thing I would mention is, and we've talked about this on previous conversations, we have entered into a strategic relationship with Accenture to do some of the operations for us. And the nature of that, we're implementing that as we speak, and there's some transition costs, basically, that are doubling up. But that's a one-time effect, and over time, we expect everything we're doing in our group business will bring down the admin ratio as part of our transformation efforts. John Barnidge : Okay. And then second question; have you developed a sense of maybe vaccination rates of insured life blocks versus that of the general population? Charlie Lowrey : Generally, John, we believe that the vaccination rate of the insured population is higher than the general population, and that reflects a variety of factors between age, geography, and a number of things. But yes, we generally feel that the insured population has a higher vaccination rate. John Barnidge : Thanks for the answers. Operator : Next, we'll go to Jimmy Bhullar with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Jimmy Bhullar : Good morning. First I had a question on your Japan -- your outlook for the operating environment in Japan, your sales were obviously pretty strong in Tokyo, but it was mostly because of easier comps. To what extent are you seeing an improvement in trends in the market as businesses are opening up, versus ongoing challenges given the increase in the case count in the country? Scott Sleyster : Thanks, Jimmy. This is Scott. As you pointed out, current Quarter sales were well ahead of the prior year, but that was significantly impacted by COVID really ramping up at that time, but this Quarter was only slightly below the First Quarter, and as you know, our typical First Quarter sales are quite strong, because that's when we're closing out our annual incentive measurement cycle. Although the situation with COVID and it's related impacts remains fluid, dynamic, whatever you want to call it, we are pretty pleased with our strong underlying business performance this quarter, particularly considering the ongoing challenges of the global pandemic. The demand for our products remain strong, I'd even say somewhat elevated because of awareness of threatening life issues. And we continue to focus in Japan on our needs-based selling approach, and that's anchored by recurring premium death protection, and then we add on to that supplemental other products like accident, health, and retirement to meet our evolving customer needs. Our operations are also increasing and enhancing and adapting to the use of digital and virtual tools to support sales activities amid the social distancing restrictions. So that's -- maybe that's a longer answer than you wanted. I would say we feel pretty good about the level that we're at. We feel that we've adapted to the technology. I have to acknowledge that it is still difficult to recruit at past levels in both LPs and LCs amid the COVID environment. But right now, we feel pretty good, actually quite good about how the business is performing in Japan. Jimmy Bhullar : Thanks. And on Assurance, when you had announced the deal, I think you had mentioned that there was the potential for up to a 1.2 billion of earn-outs. Can you discuss our results of [Indiscernible] versus the metrics that the business would have had to hit for the earnout payments. Ken Tanji : Hey Jimmy, it's Ken. When we set that earnout, you may recall that it was above what we set as a baseline for the performance of the business. It was to provide compensation if they were to exceed our original expectations. So that's the way we thought about it when we did the deal, and that continues to be the way that earn-out is positioned. Jimmy Bhullar : But you're not -- I'm assuming that you don't think that the likelihood of you having to be anything out is high; is that right? Ken Tanji : Again, it was there to provide upside if they outperformed our expectations and that's still the way it's designed. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. And when can you -- so when would you have the clarity on whether or not you're going to have to be anything? Ken Tanji : It extends to the end of next year, so we're midway through it at this point. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. And as based on the results so far, any color on yes or no or sort of how -- Ken Tanji : I think we've been -- Jimmy, I think we've been pretty transparent with the results so far. They're separately disclosed, so you can evaluate them for yourself. Jimmy Bhullar : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : And next, we'll go to Mike Ward with UBS. Please go ahead. Mike Ward : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering on the retirement segment net flows, there was some pressure. My understanding is that it's being driven in part by some seasonality in PRT flows coming through mostly in the second half. So I guess what I'm just wondering is should we be thinking about that phenomenon becoming more prevalent going forward with Full Service being divested? Andy Sullivan : Mike, it's Andy, I'll take your question. As I think you're aware, the PRT and LRT business, they are transaction-oriented businesses which means by definition, on the sale of inflow side, that's going to be episodic. But on the outflow side, it's going to be more steady and consistent, and we obviously have pretty large blocks given our past success. So I do think it's right to think of that, that will produce quarter-to-quarter variation, but I would repeat what I said earlier in the call, we are a pioneer and a leader in this. It has been quite competitive, and we plan to be disciplined, but given the opportunities in front of us, and given the strength of our platform, we think over the long term we'll see good flows and we'll be a net winner. Mike Ward : Great, thanks. That's helpful. And then I was just wondering about the organic earnings mix change within the transformations, specifically annuities. I know you've mentioned the natural VA, value running off, but just wondering what we should be thinking for the trend in the dollar amount of earnings from annuities organically. Do you have a placeholder that you use to think about what you expect just from the trend in our organic earnings from annuities ex any deals? Thanks. Andy Sullivan : So -- Charlie Lowrey : Sorry. Andy, go ahead. Andy Sullivan : Okay. Mike, what I would say is, we expect that as we said, we're going to be very committed to reduce the earnings from traditional variable annuities and that the run-off effect is -- will produce 40% to 45% of the overall result, and obviously, we would look to do transactions to get the remainder of the impact. Robert Falzon : Mike, it's Rob. I think the number that we've given out, is that the Legacy book runs off at about 3 billion a quarter, and so you can use that as sort of a metric for thinking about that runoff against the sales that we're doing on our newer products, which are less market sensitive and a very attractive [Indiscernible] and profile. You can look at the offset between those two to get a sense for how the earnings profile would run off absent to anything happening with markets. Obviously, what you've seen, is despite that net runoff. Our [Indiscernible] are up as a result of continued appreciation in the market. Mike Ward : Thanks very much. Operator : And with no further questions, I will turn the call over to Charlie Lowrey for closing remarks. Charlie Lowrey : All right. Thank you very much. Thank you for joining us today. I hope our performance this year, the progress we're making on repositioning the portfolio, advancing our cost savings program and our thoughtful consideration to capital deployment confirms that our strategy to transform Prudential remains on track. We will continue to act with conviction, and with speed to evolve our Company and deliver greater financial opportunity to all of our stakeholders. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress, and thanks again for your time today. Operator : COMPALadies and gentlemen, that concludes your conference call for today.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Bob McLaughlin. Please go ahead. Bob McLaughlin : Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today's call are; Charlie Lowrey, Chairman and CEO; Rob Falzon, Vice Chairman; Andy Sullivan, Head of US Businesses; Scott Sleyster, Head of International Businesses; Ken Tanji, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by Charlie, Rob and Ken, and then we will take your questions. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures.

And with that, I'll turn it over to Charlie. Charlie Lowrey : Thank you, Bob, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. As always, we hope you and your families remain safe and healthy. Prudential delivered solid financial results for the third quarter, reflecting our strong investment performance and high demand for the products we've introduced to support our customers as they solve their financial challenges in a changing world. We also made significant progress executing on our transformation strategy to become a higher-growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble company. First, we reached agreements to divest our full-service recordkeeping business and to sell a portion of our traditional variable annuities, advancing our pivot toward less market-sensitive and higher-growth businesses. Second, we continue to advance our cost-savings program and remain on track to achieve $750 million of savings by the end of 2023. And third, with the support of our rock-solid balance sheet, we are maintaining a disciplined and balanced approach to redeploying capital. I'll provide an update on each of these transformation initiatives before turning it over to Rob and Ken. Turning to Slide 3. In September, we reached an agreement to sell a block of our traditional variable annuities to Fortitude Re. This divestiture, which is expected to close in the first half of 2022, represents approximately 20% of our traditional individual annuities account values and significantly advances our goal of cutting in half the earnings contribution of legacy variable annuities products through a mix of strategic transactions and natural runoff. This transaction expands upon our prior divestiture activity, including the agreement we announced in July to sell our full-service recordkeeping business and the successful completion of the sales of our Taiwan and Korea insurance businesses. As a result of these divestitures to date, we expect to generate net proceeds of approximately $6 billion by the first half of 2022. And we continue to explore additional opportunities to derisk in-force blocks of business. With the pending sale of our full-service recordkeeping business and our annuities block transaction, we have combined our individual annuities and retirement businesses to better serve the retirement needs of both individuals and institutions and support our growth strategy. Turning next to our cost-savings program on slide 4. We are progressing well and remain on track to achieve our $750 million cost-savings target by the end of 2023 as we look to reduce expenses while improving both the customer and employee experience. To date, we have achieved $590 million in run rate cost savings, exceeding our $500 million target for the full year. These savings include $145 million achieved in the third quarter for a total of $385 million this year. Turning to slide 5. We continue to demonstrate a disciplined and balanced approach to capital deployment by enhancing returns to shareholders, reducing leverage and investing in the growth of our businesses, all supported by our rock solid balance sheet. Year-to-date, we returned $3.5 billion to shareholders, including $2.1 billion of share buybacks and $1.4 billion in dividend payments, reflecting a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend, compared to last year. And we're targeting to return $11 billion of capital to shareholders by the end of 2023. During the third quarter, we also took steps to enhance our financial flexibility by redeeming $900 million of outstanding debt. This reduced financial leverage and generated $30 million in annual interest savings going forward. We also continued to deploy capital in our businesses to drive long-term growth. For example, this quarter, we completed a $5 billion funded pension risk transfer transaction, which is the fourth largest transaction in the history of the PRT market and demonstrates our expertise, ability to execute at scale and commitment to this market. We also deployed capital to support our ongoing pivot to less interest rate sensitive and higher growth products, including our FlexGuard and variable life products. Our capital deployment is supported by our balance sheet strength, including highly liquid assets of $3.8 billion at the end of the third quarter and a capital position that continues to support AA financial strength rating. Turning to slide 6. I'm pleased to report a meaningful expansion of our environmental, social and governance commitments. Earlier this week, we announced our commitment to achieve a net-zero emissions across our primary global home office operations by 2050, with an interim goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2040. We're also carefully assessing the emissions impact of our investment portfolio. As an immediate action, we will restrict new direct investments in companies that derive a material portion of their revenues from thermal coal. Separately, on the social front, the Prudential Foundation achieved an important milestone during the quarter, reaching $1 billion in funding to partners aimed at eliminating barriers to financial and social mobility around the world since making its first grant in 1978. These investments include funding aligned with our racial equity commitments to support organizations, such as those supporting minority-owned small businesses and historically black colleges and universities that foster black economic empowerment and address the racial wealth gap. This milestone by the foundation follows the $1 billion investment mark achieved in our impact investing portfolio in 2020. We are confident these actions taken alongside of our strategic transformation will help us build a more sustainable company on behalf of all our stakeholders. Thank you for your time this morning. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob. Rob Falzon : Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, US and International businesses. I'll begin on Slide 7 with our financial results for the third quarter. Our pre-tax adjusted operating income was $1.8 billion or $2.78 per share on an after-tax basis and reflected the benefit of strong markets and business growth, which exceeded the net mortality impacts from COVID-19. PGIM, our global asset manager, had record-high asset management fees, driven by record account values of over $1.5 trillion that were offset by lower other related revenues relative to the elevated level in the year ago quarter as well as higher expenses supporting business growth. Results of our US Businesses increased approximately 29% from the year ago quarter and reflected higher net investment spread, driven by higher variable investment income and higher fee income, primarily driven by equity market appreciation, partially offset by less favorable underwriting experience driven by COVID-19-related mortality. Earnings in our International Businesses increased 14%, reflecting continued business growth, higher net investment spread, lower expenses and higher earnings from joint venture investments. This increase was partially offset by less favorable underwriting results, primarily driven by higher COVID-19 claims. Turning to Slide 8. PGIM continues to demonstrate the strength of its diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, alternatives, real estate and equities as a top 10 global active investment manager. PGIM's investment performance remains attractive with more than 94% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last three, five and 10-year periods. Third-party net flows were $300 million in the quarter, including institutional net flows of $700 million, primarily driven by public fixed income flows. Modest retail net outflows of $400 million were due to equity outflows from sub-advised mandates and client reallocations due to rising rates and inflation concerns. As the investment engine of Prudential, PGIM benefits from a mutually beneficial relationship with our US and International Insurance businesses. PGIM's asset origination capabilities and investment management expertise provide a competitive advantage by helping our businesses to bring enhanced solutions and more value to our customers. And our businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated flows that complement its successful third-party track record of growth. PGIM's asset management fees reached another record, up 13% compared to the year ago quarter as a result of strong flows driven by investment performance and market depreciation. PGIM's alternatives business, which has assets in excess of $250 billion, continues to demonstrate momentum across private credit and real estate equity and debt, benefiting by our global scale and market-leading positions. As an example, PGIM's private businesses deployed almost $12 billion of capital this quarter, 28% more than the year ago quarter. This strategic focus on expanding higher-yielding products has resulted in stable fee rates over time despite industry-wide fee pressures. Now turning to Slide 9. Our US businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income and benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to shift our business mix away from low-growth, capital-intensive and interest rate-sensitive products and businesses, transform our capabilities and cost structure and expand our addressable markets. In addition to the agreement that we announced in July to sell our full-service retirement business, this quarter, we also announced the sale of a portion of our legacy in-force annuities block to reduce the overall contribution of traditional variable annuities. These transactions are significant steps forward in shifting our business mix and product portfolio to reduce market sensitivity and accelerate long-term growth. In addition, our product pivots have worked well, demonstrated by continued strong sales of our buffered annuity products, which were $1.3 billion in the third quarter, representing 88% of total individual annuity sales. Since the launch of FlexGuard in 2020, sales have exceeded $6 billion. These sales reflect customer demand for investment solutions that offer the potential for appreciation from equity markets combined with downside protection. We have also exercised discipline through frequent pricing actions, and our sales continue to benefit from having a strong and trusted brand and highly effective distribution team. Also, our Individual Life sales continue to be strong and reflect our product pivot strategy, with higher variable life sales compared to the year ago quarter. Our retirement business reflected strong sales in the quarter, including a $5.2 billion funded pension risk transfer transaction and $1.6 billion of international reinsurance transactions, demonstrating our market-leading capabilities. With respect to Assurance, our digitally enabled distribution platform, total revenues, our primary financial metric as we concentrate on scaling the business, were up 47% over the prior year quarter. During the third quarter, we increased the number of agents to prepare for the seasonally higher expected demand of the Medicare annual enrollment period that occurs in the fourth quarter. Turning to slide 10, our International Businesses include our Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other operations focused on high-growth emerging markets. Sales across both Life Planner and Gibraltar operations were higher than last quarter amidst the state of emergency in Japan that ended on September 30th. However, sales were lower than the prior year quarter, which were elevated ahead of the US dollar-denominated product repricing in Japan that we implemented in the third quarter of last year. We also continue to see sales momentum in Brazil, particularly within the third-party distribution channel. We remain encouraged by the resiliency of our unique distribution capabilities, which have supported the continued growth of our in-force business. And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken. Ken Tanji : Thanks Rob. I'll begin on slide 11, which provides insight into earnings for the fourth quarter of 2021 relative to our third quarter results. Pretax adjusted operating income in the third quarter was $1.8 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $3.78 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense for how our fourth quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items. First, variable investment income outperformed expectations in the third quarter by $570 million. Next, we included a placeholder for COVID-19 claims experience in the fourth quarter that is a similar level to our experience in the third quarter. While we have provided this placeholder for COVID-19-related claims experience, the actual impact will depend on a variety of factors, such as infection and fatality rates, geographic, and demographic mix and the continued acceptance and effectiveness of vaccines. Third, we expect seasonal expenses and other items will be higher in the fourth quarter by $140 million. Fourth, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by about $10 million, reflecting the difference between new money rates and disposition yields of our investment portfolio. And last, we expect the fourth quarter effective tax rate to normalize. These items combined get us to a baseline of $2.27 per share in the fourth quarter. I'll note that if you exclude items specific to the fourth quarter, earnings per share would be $3.05. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power has increased from last quarter, driven by the benefits of business growth, our cost-savings program and market appreciation. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the fourth quarter. Turning to slide 12. We continue to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position continues to support a AA financial strength rating and have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets were $3.8 billion, which is greater than three times annual fixed charges, and other sources of funds include free cash flow from our businesses and contingent capital facilities. Turning to slide 13 and in summary, we are executing on divestitures. We are on track to achieve our targeted cost-saving initiatives. And with the support of our rock solid balance sheet, we are thoughtfully redeploying capital. Now I'll turn it to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Your line is now live. Erik Bass : Hi. Thank you. So we've recently seen asset managers, such as T. Rowe and Franklin, announce sizable deals to acquire private and alternative asset capabilities and transactions that were generally well received by investors. Wondering if you see more properties like these available in the market? And would this be the type of programmatic M&A that you might consider for PGIM? Andy Sullivan : So thanks, Erik. It's Andy and good morning, I'll take your question. So let me start by reiterating that PGIM is a business that has demonstrated incredibly strong ability to grow organically year-after-year. And that's really due to the success of our multi-manager model and the team's very strong execution. We've seen $55 billion in net flows over the last five years, and we've seen $11 billion in year-to-date flows. As we've talked about in the past, though, we do want to build upon that track record with programmatic bolt-on M&A. And we've been very assertive in making sure that we're both in the now and in the flow, and we are aware of these transactions in the marketplace. We're leaned into areas that are higher-growth and higher-fee-oriented areas. Three I would mention; we're looking to continue to globalize the business, specifically in Europe and Asia. We're looking to continue to build on our already strong alternatives business, where we have $250 billion in assets under management. And our acquisition of Montana Capital Partners is a great example of that. And we're looking in the area of real assets. As always, we're going to be disciplined in what we do and in how we deploy capital. To your question about sizable deals, we very much feel, if you look across our managers in PGIM, we are at scale. So it's unlikely that you would see us do what I would call a big pure-play scale deal. But to the degree that we would look and potentially do something larger, it would come with a key capability or strengthen us in a material way in a key geography and also bring along with it synergies. Erik Bass : Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And then was hoping you could talk a little bit or provide some more color on your group claims experience this quarter, and particularly, the trends you're seeing in both group life and disability. Andy Sullivan : Sure, Eric. It's Andy. I'll take that one again. And let me start on the group life side. So as I'm sure you know and you've seen in the press, Delta has had a large impact on the country. The deaths in 3Q were 3 times what were expected. We were expecting 30,000 deaths, and we saw 95,000. We are a top three life and disability carrier, so -- and because of that, we have a very big and broad book of business. And there's really three effects that I would point to that we saw in the quarter. First, U.S. deaths in the age group between 35 and 54 tripled from a percentage perspective. And we cover a lot of younger workers. The average age of our group block is in the neighborhood of 46 years old. Second, as you probably know and expect, we have a large national account book of business and have a very strong share in health care, in retail and in manufacturing. These are areas where frontline workers are out and about by the definition and nature of their job, and therefore, more exposed. And then, the third thing I would mention is, about 50% of the pandemic impact we saw on the life side came from claims in the southern United States. So, clearly, this is very unfortunate that we keep experiencing this, but we're proud that we're able to deliver on our promises and help these families. As I flip to the group disability side, I would frame it as, we're seeing what we expected to see, and we're seeing what we prepared for as an organization. And as I frame this, this impact on the disability side was not the predominant impact on group insurance. It was the life side. But having said that, the disability benefit ratio was somewhat elevated at 85.9%. There were really two effects that were at play. In our fee-based STD and absence business, we are continuing to see a higher level of absence in STD claims. That really leads to more expense in the business, and you see that show up in the admin ratio. On the LTD side, as we talked about in previous quarters, we had both put up IBNR, but also we had built claims staffing to be able to -- be ready to handle what we expected to come, which we thought we would see enhanced incidents due to both the morbidity impacts of the pandemic, but also the impacts from the unemployment -- the subsequent unemployment. And we are seeing that. Our incidents on LTD was up about 10% in the quarter, and our severity was up as well, about 10% in the quarter. But again, this is what we expected to see, and this is what we prepared for. So we're handling it well. And we would expect, obviously, for this to improve and subside over time. Erik Bass : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Your line is now live. Ryan Krueger : Hey, good morning. First question was, what areas are you focused on additional derisking? Does that include more potential variable annuity transactions? And then, is individual life also part of the consideration? Charlie Lowrey : Yes. Hi, Ryan, it's Charlie Lowrey. I'll take that. As we stated in our opening remarks, we're making significant progress on executing to become a higher-growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble business. And this includes, as you rightly point out, the sales of our full-service recordkeeping business and our block of traditional variable annuities, as well as the completed sales of what we've talked about in Korea, Taiwan, Italy and Poland. We have also noted, to your point, that in the past, we're looking at other blocks of business that may include the areas that you spoke about. So we're accomplishing a significant amount, but we still have a lot of work to do. I would note that in terms of our overall goals, we have -- which we stated is between $5 billion and $10 billion of capital that we wanted to free up to reposition, we're already $6 billion into that, right? So we don't need to do other deals at this point. We are very happy with the economics of the deals we've done as we think it reflects the high quality of the businesses we have, but we'll only transact other deals if they make sense for all our stakeholders as we go forward. Ryan Krueger : Thanks. And then a bit of a follow-up on M&A. So you've done a few deals, but they've been on the pretty small side, I think, in terms of capital, and you have a fair amount of capital coming in next year from the transactions you've announced. Do you still anticipate ultimately redeploying that additional capital freed up into M&A transactions over time, or if not, would you consider upping the buybacks again? Charlie Lowrey : Yes. I think what we've always said in the past, Ryan, is that if we can't find good uses for that capital, we will return that capital to stakeholders. But what I would also say is that we are looking both organically and inorganically at ways of redeploying that capital, and organic investment is another way of doing that. So we'll be very disciplined as we go forward in looking at potential acquisitions. The M&A is going to focus on, again, asset management and emerging markets as we increase the percentage of earnings from growth areas and reduce the percentage of our legacy traditional variable annuities but we\u2019ll continue to focus in a very disciplined way on those two areas. Andy mentioned in his previous comment the acquisition of Montana as a capital partner as an example of that, but we'll look at the pipeline that's out there and see if there are good deals to do. If they're not, we'll return capital to shareholders as we have in the past. Ryan Krueger : Thanks, Charlie. Operator : Thanks. Our next question today is coming from Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners. Your line is now live. Humphrey Lee : Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. My first question is regarding the fourth quarter outlook for Assurance IQ. Can you talk about the preparation you've done so far in terms of -- for the enrollment period? And how confident are you in terms of kind of generating the necessary level of activities to support the breakeven AOI? Andy Sullivan : Humphrey, good morning, it's Andy. And thanks for your question. So as you know and as we've talked about in the past, we do expect our revenue at Assurance IQ to be strongest in the fourth quarter given the annual enrollment season. Medicare Advantage remains a very strong opportunity for us. If you look, last year, we had a little under 1% share in that marketplace, and that marketplace is growing at 10% per year. So there's a lot of space to operate. As you saw in the quarter, we continue to invest in the platform, both in the business overall, but specifically in the quarter, we invested in building out our W-2 Prudential agent force. And what we saw is coming into the annual enrollment period season, we came in with more agents than we had last year, and those agents were operating at a higher level of productivity right out of the gate. So we're encouraged versus last year. As I've said before, we're confident in what the platform can do for us in the long term and its ability to scale. Ken Tanji : Humphrey, it's Ken. Just if I could add, as Andy said, we're well prepared. For the purposes of the baseline for the fourth quarter, we just simply put in a placeholder for Assurance at a breakeven because we wanted to neutralize for the seasonality, but it's not a forecast. It's just a placeholder to neutralize the earnings for the fourth quarter. Humphrey Lee : Okay. Got it. I see. Yes, because I was just thinking like what type of revenue level would you need to have in order to get to that break-even target, but it seems like this is just more of a placeholder as opposed to anything. Ken Tanji : That's right. Humphrey Lee : Okay. All right. My second question is regarding PGIM, especially on the retail side. The flow seems to be -- kind of have softened a bit over the past couple of quarters. Can you provide some color in terms of what you're seeing there and what kind of actions that you have taken to improve retail flows? Andy Sullivan : Yes. Humphrey, it's Andy again. Thank you for your question on PGIM. So as we've discussed in the past, we will see natural variability and variation quarter-to-quarter when it comes to flows. This quarter, in aggregate, we saw modest inflows driven by a positive result on the institutional side, thanks to our work at fixed income and real estate. We did experience modest outflows on the retail side as a result of client reallocation out of equities and in the fixed income space into shorter-duration strategies. What I would say is, in any given quarter, you could experience client reallocations, and that can go either way. What we think is very important to keep your eye on is the long-term track record. And as I've said, this is a business where we've experienced a lot of flows over the long term and $11 billion year-to-date. That really comes from both outstanding capabilities and strong execution. We have a broad and diversified product portfolio in PGIM. And we -- as you've seen in the release, we continue to have exceptional investment performance with 94%-plus outperforming benchmarks in the three, five and 10-year period. So we're confident that while there'll be variability quarter-to-quarter, potentially in the near-term, we will be a net winner over time. Humphrey Lee : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thanks. Our next question today is coming from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Your line is now live. Tracy Benguigui : Thank you. So assume this quarter so far is an early glimpse on LDTI with some company disclosures. There was one that was quantitative, another more qualitative. Your 10-Q is not out yet, but are you planning to add any disclosures there, like either now this quarter or in the near future? Ken Tanji : Hey, Tracy, it's Ken. We continue to evaluate the new standards and refine our methods. And we continue to adjust as we move towards the effective date, and the effective date is still over a year away. And the impact also will be subject to rates at the time of the effective date as well as the actions that we have been taking and will continue to make to shift our business to be less market-sensitive. And that will have an impact obviously at the time of the effective date. So overall, we're making good progress on implementing the new standards, but it's too early to provide estimates, and that's where we are. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. Maybe just one question on that, on your Japanese business. To the extent that there are dollar-dominated products, does that act like a mitigant at all in your view when those liabilities have to be marked to market? Ken Tanji : Yes, we've had a long-standing capability and competitive advantage in US dollar business in Japan. And again, our Japan business is focused on sort of the lifetime needs of our customers with a primary focus on death protection, including those that are denominated in US dollars. It does have a long duration profile and it's supported with robust reserves and a high-quality investment portfolio and is very financially resilient. Again, we're not -- it's too early for us to provide estimates. But overall, although the accounting will be modified, we feel very good about the overall profitability of the business, the risk profile, and the financial strength of our Japan business, including the US dollar business. Tracy Benguigui : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. Andrew Kligerman : Hey good morning. I guess the first question is a follow-up on your capital management. Charlie, you made a comment -- two comments that you would look at the pipeline and that organic investing is a way to deploy the capital. So, could you clarify what you meant by organic investing and the amount of money that might that require? And then with regard to the pipeline, color on that. Is there -- because the two deals you did were rather small, is it possible that there might not be anything that really intrigues you, and you might have other uses for that capital? Charlie Lowrey : Sure. So, a couple of comments, taking them in order. In terms of organic growth, if you look at FlexGuard as an example, so we have pivoted away from the variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits and then started with new products and are investing in those and supporting those as they grow. And that really ties into becoming a less market-sensitive company, and frankly, a higher growth company. So, that's an example. So we'll look at the product pivots that we do as an example of organic growth. In terms of inorganic growth, I think there are going to be plenty of opportunities as we go forward, especially in the areas that we want to invest in, namely asset management and emerging markets, some of the growth areas. So, over time, I think we will find good places to put the capital. And as always, if we don't find places to put that capital to the extent that we don't have attractive opportunities that meet our strategic and financial criteria, we'll return the excess capital to shareholders as we've done in the past. Andrew Kligerman : Got it. That makes sense, Charlie. And then with regard to your international businesses in Japan, Gibraltar and the Life Planners, sales were off pretty sharply in the 30%-plus range. And in the press release, you cited the dollar-denominated product repricing that went on in the year ago quarter, that the people wanted to catch these products. Could you clarify for us whether those products written a year ago were adequately priced and adequate returns? Was there a possibility for anti-selection? And now going forward, with an emergency act and kind of that getting out of the rearview, is there a possibility that as COVID subsides, these sales could really jet upward? Scott Sleyster : Thanks, Andrew. This is Scott. I'll go ahead and take that one. As you recall, we took significant crediting rate actions last August on our US dollar products. And that's really just part of our ongoing effort to maintain strong profitability on all of our new business activity. And that's across Japan, but across all of our other operations. And as is typical, that does create a sales surge ahead of the crediting rate, which typically pull sales forward from a quarter or two. And then additionally, I would say the impact of COVID emergency states, as well as the Olympics in Japan also dampened sales for a period. But we are happy with the recovery that we've had in sales. And if you look at the third quarter -- quarter-over-quarter, it looks good. In Japan, we benefit from having multiple distribution channels. We've got life planners, life consultants, the affinity channel, bank and third-party distribution. And further, I would say that we've made significant progress in using and enhancing technology and new strategies to support both our customers and our distribution channels. So, I think all of that put together says we feel pretty good about the sales momentum that we have. And we maintain a strong discipline and a continuous watch on our pricing actions. And where we're priced now, quite frankly, we don't foresee any material repricing actions on the horizon in Japan. And I think we made the actions that we took a year ago in a timely manner. Ken, were you going to say something? Ken Tanji : I'd just say, our Japan business has consistently written business above its cost of capital. We are happy with the returns last year, and it's these pricing actions that keep us in good position from both a profitability, but a customer value proposition. So, it's been a pretty consistent story. Charlie Lowrey : And Andrew, it's Charlie, if I could just add one -- Andrew, if I could add one other thing, and that is what Scott alluded to, which is that we have been extraordinarily disciplined in looking at the pricing of all our products around the world, not just in Japan, but as Scott said, in all the other countries, including the US. And we've been really pleased as we've increased the pricing, as we've had to with the low interest rates, the strength of the sales, and I think that comes from 3 points of view. One is the strength of our brand. Second is the strength of the solutions we provide, such as \u2013 with the new introduction of FlexGuard in this example. And third is the quality of our distribution, which is both in-house distribution and through third parties. So, we have plenty of different ways of distributing the product and I think that endures to our benefit. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. Tom Gallagher : Good morning. So individual mortality held up pretty well this quarter despite the increase in COVID mortality and also by some measures, there was elevated non-COVID mortality also this quarter. In terms of describing why you think your block only had minor sensitivity, can you comment on what that might be? Is it just vaccination levels, older age, demographics and geography, or anything you could share on that? Andy Sullivan : Yes. Tom, it's Andy. I'll take your question, and thanks for the question. So when you think about our Individual Life block in the third quarter. I'd go through a series of items here. I think we did see lift. Third quarter, I think, as you're aware, is our highest underwriting gain quarter. So there's definitely seasonality that's showing in the results. We also saw in the quarter fewer large face amount claims. And again, that's the type of thing that will vary quarter-to-quarter. This quarter, we happened to just see fewer of those. I guess the -- when it comes to the pandemic effect, in particular, I would say that our block tends to be more oriented towards the Northeast as far as geographic distribution. And I think it's pretty clear that from a US death perspective, it was heavier in the Southern region of the United States. And then, yes, you mentioned this, but the average age of our ILI block tends to be older, and those older-age demographics tend to have higher vaccination rates. Tom Gallagher : Got you. Okay. Thanks. And then for my follow-up, just curious, any updates on economic solvency regime in Japan? Is that still -- I think last I heard, it was like 2025. Is that still the timing? And if so, how do you feel that you're positioned to adopt that? Rob Axel : Hey, Tom, it's Rob. I'll take a shot at that. To our knowledge, there's not been any change in the timing of that. The JFSA has been well synchronized with a broader international -- ICS, or the International Capital Standard, that's being rolled out. And so it's -- their plan has always been to sort of be slightly behind the implementation of that as their new solvency regime is closely aligned to that. And with respect to our Japan business, I think as both Ken and Scott have pointed out, the underlying economics to our Japan business are incredibly strong. And so we would hope that under both accounting and regulatory constructs that, that ultimately is visible. Having said that, we would -- we have articulated some concerns, as others in the industry have, with regard to both the international capital standard that's being proposed in terms of some fundamental flaws that continue to persist there. And then to the extent that those carry over into Japan's economic solvency regime, that would be a concern that we would have. But we continue to be in an active dialogue both on the international front and in Japan, along with a number of our peers. And we're optimistic that through that continued engagement, we can ensure that the economics of the underlying business get appropriately reflected in the regulatory constructs. Tom Gallagher : Okay. Thanks, Rob. Operator : Thanks. Our next question today is coming from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, on the PRT business. You guys had some pretty good activity in the third quarter. Can you just talk about the pipeline there for the fourth quarter? I know that tends to be heavy towards the end of the year. And any initial outlook for 2022? Andy Sullivan : Yes. Elyse, hi, it's Andy. I'd be happy to take the question. So, we think the market in 3Q was in and around $17 billion and that's very consistent with what communicated on the previous couple of calls, that we felt the back half of the year would be very healthy. The average funded status for plans is around 97%, which is the best level in 10 years and they still have a very strong desire to transact. We think the total market size for the year will be in the neighborhood of $40 billion and we think that level of momentum will continue in the near-term. This is a space that, in many ways, we're a pioneer in and very much a leader in the space. As we've said in the past, we are very committed to it, and we are going to pick our spots. We're very confident that the strength of our brand and our capabilities and our track record. We're going to gain more than our fair share over time. But in the near-term, we do think the market is going to be healthy. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then my second question, going on to your Group Life book, you guys gave some good color on what you'll be elevated COVID boxes there in the third quarter. As we think about the fourth quarter in 2022, do you expect that you would see losses in line with kind of that same elevated severity that you've been seeing? And then how much of your losses that you've set up so far for COVID or IBNR? Andy Sullivan : So, Elyse, maybe I'll start and then Ken could follow-up. So, I kind of went through the dynamics of what's causing the elevated mortality, the three predominant things being the average age, the predominance of our book in certain segments, and the distribution of the claims being in places where the vaccination rates are lower. We would expect those underlying drivers to continue near-term into the fourth quarter. Ken Tanji : Yes. And Elyse, in terms of IBNR, the -- it's -- we stayed pretty current on claim activity. So, the lag is measured in weeks and we have a pretty established process to measure that and so that continues. In terms of an outlook for 2022, we have not provided an outlook beyond the current quarter. And based upon, as Andy described, just sort of the continuation of current trends, we think that's the most reasonable approach. The situation is very unique and very dynamic, a lot of variables at play, whether it's social distancing or other preventive measures or vaccines and treatments and variants. So, we've -- in our baseline, we've extrapolated the current trends and that's what that reflects. Elyse Greenspan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler. Your line is now live. John Barnidge : Thank you. Just thinking about the group business, given the enduring nature of the pandemic, unfortunately, is there a need to build more administrative expenses to support that effort? Andy Sullivan : So, John, it's Andy. I think as we've talked about in the past, we actually have a higher level of both call and claims staff across our product lines. We hired out ahead of what we expected to see. So, we were well prepared as it was coming in. But we think that that level is already reflected in the admin ratio that you see. John Barnidge : That's great. Thank you. And then maybe my follow-up, just wanted to touch on that comment around LTD incidence increase in frequency and severity. How should we be thinking of this maybe in light of vaccine mandates? There's headlines about Boeing and Raytheon in percentage of workers there. I'm just trying to think through that in light of PRU's focus within the group market. Thank you. Andy Sullivan : So it's Andy, again. I guess I'd say two things. Our expectation for the number of deaths in the quarter take into account what we think the current approach is in the employer marketplace and the current landscape of mandates. To the degree, our book tends to be more of a national account book of business, and there are more mandates in that segment, I think that would be a help to us and a tailwind. John Barnidge : Great. Thank you for your answers, and best of luck. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is a follow-up from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Your line is now live. Tracy Benguigui : Thanks for taking another question. I just want to touch on your upcoming combination of individual and institutional retirement business. Is this just to simplify your operational model after the pending full-service sale, or should we expect anything strategic coming out of that either on the expense or revenue side? Andy Sullivan : So Tracy, it's Andy. Let me take your question of -- about the drivers. So first and foremost, this is really a statement about our commitment as a firm to helping solve the retirement needs in America. And we continue to see a real need in the pension derisking area. We continue to see the need to lean in and help individuals in the retirement accumulation and deccumulation journeys. This was really about taking two businesses that had great momentum, that were market leaders in their space and combining together the market leading talent market and market leading capabilities. The benefits we expect to see is it will accelerate our decision making as we go -- as we continue to go after the retirement need and sharpen our focus on the retirement space. So that was really the driver, and it's an important step in how we're transforming our business mix and system. Tracy Benguigui : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Jimmy Bhullar : So just a follow-up question on, Charlie, your comments around dispositions and/or derisking reinsurance type transactions. I think you mentioned annuities potentially and Individual Life as well. But how do you think about long-term care in that context? And is that a business where you're seeing counterparties emerge, or is it still like the bid ask as to why to expect a transaction in the near future? Charlie Lowrey : Yeah. I'll start and then maybe Ken can add to that, Jimmy. I think what you observed is exactly correct. So it is something that we would, obviously, look at if the market was there, but I think the market is extraordinarily thin at this point for bidders on blocks like that. I would also observe that we have a very relatively small block of business and a relatively young block of business. And as a result -- and one, frankly, that we feel reasonably good about, in fact, quite good about. So if we are, as we've said, going to be very disciplined about the divestitures we make and with an eye toward creating shareholder value, we need to get -- make sure that the -- if we did transact something that it would be a transaction that was in the economic interest of our shareholders. And given the young block that it is, the bid-ask spread, if you will, can be quite large. So we'll continue to evaluate options if they come up. But at this point, we are continuing to run the book, and the book is going quite well. Ken, anything to add. Ken Tanji : No. I think that covers it well, Charlie. Nothing to add from me. Jimmy Bhullar : And then, just on the -- can you talk about the operating environment in your two largest international markets, in Japan and in Brazil? Obviously, different stages in terms of COVID in both markets. But how are those businesses faring? And what your outlook is for sales, given the pandemic and economic conditions in Latin America? Charlie Lowrey : Well, why don't I start, Jimmy, with Japan, which I think I covered a little bit before. But I would say that the combined impact of the states of emergency and then the Olympics really did slow things down, and the effect of that really ran through September 29, with the state of emergency. We've come out of that nicely. And we really feel that our channels have benefited from our use of technology, as have our customers during this period. So we really feel like our sales organizations have adapted well to the new environment. And now that we see things out of a state of emergency and returning to a more normal state, you've seen a good sequential quarter. I would also say that, recruiting has been somewhat challenged during a coveted environment. We've also learned how to recruit and bring people on board in a more remote environment. But I think, as we come out of COVID, both the actual sales activity and the ability to recruit will continue to improve, and we see that as a positive sign. In Brazil, our sales have been improving from the combination of having a strong Life Planner model. But more importantly, we've been building our third-party distribution. And most recently, that's now exceeded a-third of our sales. And just a few years ago, that was closer to 10%. So we've seen positive momentum from the channels that we sell in. COVID hit harder -- quite frankly, a bit harder in Brazil than it did in Japan. And again, we're really happy with the resiliency that our sales force has shown there. So overall, we feel good about the trends in both markets. And I think the most recent quarter is indicative of why we maintain that confidence. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We reach the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lowrey for any further closing comments. Charlie Lowrey : Thank you. And thank you all for joining us today. Our performance this year and the progress we're making on repositioning our business mix and advancing the cost-savings program, along with disciplined capital deployment, reinforces our confidence in our strategy to transform Prudential and generate substantial growth. We remain optimistic about the opportunity to continue to deliver strong financial outcomes to all our stakeholders. Thank you again for joining us today and for your time. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webinar. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

And now, I'll turn it over to Charlie. Charles Lowrey : Thank you, Bob, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. Prudential delivered strong financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year, reflecting favorable investment performance and continued high demand for the products we introduced during the pandemic to address our customers' evolving needs. 2021 was also a pivotal year for Prudential and our efforts to become a higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble company. First, we are repositioning our business mix to generate sustainable long-term growth with reduced market sensitivity. Second, we continue to advance our cost savings program. And third, we maintained our disciplined and thoughtful approach to deploying capital. I'll provide an update on each of these areas before turning it over to Rob and Ken. Moving to Slide 3. We are making significant progress repositioning our business for sustainable long-term growth with reduced market sensitivity through a mix of divestitures and strategic programmatic acquisitions. Following the successful completion of the sales of our Korea and Taiwan insurance businesses, which produced $1.8 billion in proceeds, we reached agreements to divest our full service business and a portion of our traditional variable annuities. We are on track to close both of these transactions in the first half of 2022 and generate additional proceeds of over $4 billion. We are redeploying capital in part through highly targeted acquisitions and investments in asset management and emerging markets. Last year, PGIM acquired Montana Capital Partners, a European-based private equity secondaries asset manager; and Green Harvest, a separately managed account platform that provides customized solutions for high net worth investors. Meanwhile, on the emerging markets front, we closed on an investment in ICEA LION Holdings, a highly respected financial services market leader in Kenya with operations in Tanzania and Uganda. Turning to Slide 4. We continue to advance our cost savings program and are on track to achieve $750 million in savings by the end of 2023. To date, we have already achieved $635 million in run rate cost savings, exceeding our $500 million target for 2021. We have also taken steps to improve experiences around the world for our customers and employees through innovation. This includes using automation, artificial intelligence and other technology to expedite underwriting, reduce and simplify processes, provide faster, more convenient service options, and deliver meaningful financial advice in the ways our customers want it. I'll touch more upon how we're using the technology in a moment. Turning to Slide 5. We have maintained a disciplined and balanced approach to deploying capital by enhancing returns to shareholders, reducing financial leverage and by investing in the growth of our businesses. We currently plan to return a total of $11 billion of capital to shareholders between 2021 and the end of 2023. This includes $4.3 billion returned during 2021 through share repurchases and dividends. As part of this plan, the Board has authorized $1.5 billion of share repurchases and a 4% increase in our quarterly dividend beginning in the first quarter. This represents our 14th consecutive annual dividend increase. We also reduced debt by $1.3 billion in 2021. In addition to the acquisitions I previously mentioned, we\u2019ve also made investments in our businesses to drive long-term growth and to meet the evolving needs of our customers. In PGIM, for example, we have significantly strengthened our suite of environmental, social and governance bond funds to better serve sustainability-focused investors. Meanwhile, in our insurance businesses, we continue to develop products that are less market-sensitive and have higher-growth potential, such as our FlexGuard and Variable life products, with a focus on improved customer experience and driving greater operational efficiency. One example, as I mentioned earlier, is our use of artificial intelligence. We use AI to quickly and accurately assess risk in our life insurance businesses and to expedite the application and underwriting process. The application of innovative technology generated significant efficiencies for our global businesses during 2021, while delivering a dramatically better experience for our customers. We will continue to expand the use of AI and other emerging technologies across the firm. Our capital deployment strategy is supported by a rock solid balance sheet, which includes $3.6 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the fourth quarter and a capital position that continues to support our AA financial strength rating. Turning to Slide 6. Our ongoing efforts to transform the company in 2021 go hand-in-hand with Prudential's long-standing commitment to sustainability. This commitment is reflected in several significant enhancements to our environmental, social and governance framework last year. We committed to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 across our primary global home office operations, with an interim goal of becoming carbon-neutral in these facilities by 2040. We are also reviewing our general account investment holdings and have restricted new direct investments in companies that derive 25% or more of their revenues from thermal coal. On the social front, the Prudential Foundation surpassed $1 billion in grants to partners primarily focused on eliminating barriers to financial and social mobility around the world. This achievement follows another milestone that we reached in 2020 when our impact investment portfolio exceeded $1 billion. We also continue to advance our nine commitments to racial equity through investments in funding for organizations committed to diversity, equity and inclusion, and through internal measures, including diversity training and our commitment to equitable compensation for our employees. Our governance actions reflected a shared commitment to diversity and inclusion, beginning at the top with over 80% of our independent Board Directors being diverse. It also includes the steps we are taking to improve diverse representation throughout Prudential and to provide greater transparency around the composition of our U.S. workforce. In 2021, we enhanced our diversity disclosures by publishing EEO-1 data and the results of our pay equity analysis for our U.S. employees. We also expanded our policy of tying compensation plans for senior executives to the achievement of workforce diversity goals. As I noted earlier, we believe our sustainability commitments and transformation to become a higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble business are closely connected. Together, they help us fulfill our purpose of making lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world by expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security for customers and clients around the globe. Before turning it over to Rob, I'd like to thank all of our employees for their unwavering dedication to the customers and communities we serve, particularly in light of the continued challenges created by the pandemic. I am proud of the progress we made and the momentum we built in 2021 and look forward to making an even more meaningful difference in the lives of all our stakeholders in 2022 and beyond. Thank you for your time this morning. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob. Robert Falzon : Thanks, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, U.S. and International businesses. I'll begin on Slide 7 with our financial results. For 2021, pre-tax adjusted operating income was $7.3 billion or $14.58 a share on an after-tax basis. Results for the year included a benefit from the outperformance of variable investment income that exceeded target returns by about $1.6 billion, reflecting market performance, strategy and manager selection. In the fourth quarter, pre-tax adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion or $3.18 a share on an after-tax basis, while GAAP net income was $3.13 per share. Of note, our GAAP net income includes realized investment gains and favorable market experience updates that were offset by a goodwill impairment that resulted in a charge of $837 million net of tax. This charge reflects 2 main drivers of a reduction in the estimated fair value of Assurance. First, we acquired capabilities to increase access to more customers, and we have experienced good revenue growth. However, this growth has been slower than expected and we are now assuming it will take longer to monetize into earnings and cash flow. And second, we have seen a significant decline in publicly traded peer valuations, which is a key input in our assessment of fair value. Turning to the operating results of our businesses. PGIM, our global asset manager, had record asset management fees driven by record account values of over $1.5 trillion. Relative to the year-ago quarter, earnings reflected the elevated level of other related revenues last year as well as higher expenses supporting business growth in the current period. Results of our U.S. Businesses increased 13% from the year-ago quarter and reflected higher net investment spread, including a greater benefit from variable investment income, higher fee income, primarily driven by equity market appreciation, partially offset by higher expenses driven by a legal reserve and less favorable underwriting experience due to COVID-19-related mortality. Earnings in our International Businesses increased 5%, reflecting continued business growth, lower expenses and higher net investment spread. Turning to Slide 8. PGIM continues to demonstrate the strength of its diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, alternatives, real estate and equities as a top 10 global investment manager. PGIM's investment performance remains attractive with more than 95% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last 3-, 5- and 10-year periods. This performance has contributed to third-party net flows of $11 billion for the year, with positive flows across U.S. and non-U.S.-based clients in both public and private strategies. As the investment engine of Prudential, success and growth of PGIM and of our U.S. and International insurance businesses are mutually enhancing. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise and access to institutional and other sources of private capital provide a competitive advantage by helping our businesses to bring enhanced solutions, innovation and more value to our customers. And our businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated flows and unique access to insurance liabilities that complement its successful third-party track record of growth. PGIM's sixth consecutive quarter of record asset management fees reflect strong business fundamentals and record assets under management. We continue to expand our global equity franchise to grow our alternatives and private credit business, which has assets in excess of $240 billion across private credit and real estate equity and debt and benefits from our global scale and market-leading positions. Notably, PGIM's private businesses deployed nearly $50 billion of gross capital, up 33% from last year. Now turning to Slide 9. Our U.S. Businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income and also benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to shift our business mix towards higher growth and less interest rate-sensitive products and businesses to transform our capabilities and cost structure and to expand our addressable markets. Our product pivots have worked well, demonstrated by continued strong sales of our buffered annuities, which were nearly $6 billion for the year, representing 87% of total individual annuity sales. These sales reflect customer demand for investment solutions that offer the potential for appreciation from equity markets combined with downside protection. We have also exercised discipline through frequent pricing actions and our sales benefit from having a strong and trusted brand and a highly effective distribution team. Our Individual Life sales also reflect our earlier product pivot strategy with Variable products representing 71% of sales for the year. Our Retirement business has market-leading capabilities, which drove robust international reinsurance and funded pension risk transfer sales, including a $5 billion transaction, which was the fourth largest in the history of the market during 2021. And reflected strong persistency and revenue growth in 2021 across all segments. With respect to Assurance, our digitally enabled distribution platform, total revenues for the year were up 43% from last year. Turning to Slide 10. Our International Businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other businesses focused on high-growth emerging markets. We remain encouraged by the resiliency of our unique distribution capabilities, which have maintained the stability of our sales and our in-force business despite the pandemic. In Japan, we are focused on providing high-quality service, growing our world-class sales force and expanding our geographic coverage and product offerings. Our needs-based approach and mortality protection focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a carefully selected portfolio of businesses and regions where customers' needs are growing where there are compelling opportunities to build market-leading businesses and partnerships and where Prudential -- the Prudential enterprise can add value. As we look ahead, we're well positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We plan to continue to invest in growth businesses and markets to deliver industry-leading customer experiences and create the next generation of financial solutions to better serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. And with that, I will now hand it over to Ken. Kenneth Tanji : Thanks, Rob. I'll begin on Slide 11, which provides insight into earnings for the first quarter of 2022 relative to our fourth quarter results. Pre-tax adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter was $1.6 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $3.18 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense for all our first quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items : first, variable investment income outperformed expectations in the fourth quarter by $440 million. Next, we adjust underwriting experience by a net $90 million. This adjustment includes a placeholder for COVID-19's claims experience in the first quarter of $195 million, assuming 75,000 COVID-19-related fatalities in the U.S. While we have provided this placeholder for COVID-related claims experience, the actual impact will depend on a variety of factors such as infection and fatality rates, geographic and demographic mix and the effectiveness of vaccines. Third, we expect seasonal expenses and other items will be lower in the first quarter by $105 million. Fourth, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by about $10 million, reflecting the difference between new money rates and disposition yields of our investment portfolio. And last, we expect the first quarter effective tax rate to normalize. These items combined get us to a baseline of $2.73 per share for the first quarter. I'll note that if you exclude items specific to the first quarter, earnings per share would be $3.17. The key takeaway is that the underlying earnings power per share continues to improve and has increased 9% over the last year, driven by business growth, the benefits of our cost savings program, capital management and market appreciation. While we have provided these items to consider, please note there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the first quarter. As we look forward, we have also included seasonal and other considerations for 2022 in the appendix. Turning to Slide 12. We continue to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position continues to support a AA financial strength rating and we have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets were $3.6 billion and within our $3 billion to $5 billion liquidity target range and other sources of funds include free cash flow from our businesses and contingent capital facilities. Turning to Slide 13 and in summary, we are executing on our plans to reposition our businesses and we are on track to achieve our targeted cost savings. And with the support of our rock solid balance sheet, we are thoughtfully deploying capital. Now I'll turn it to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Your line is now live. Ryan Krueger : Hi, good morning. The recent acquisitions that you've talked about have not utilized a material amount of capital. I guess, given the amount of capital that you are freeing up from the full service retirement and variable annuity block sales, would you consider deals that were a bit larger in size if they're available and they need the opportunities you're looking for? Charles Lowrey : Hey, Ryan, this is Charlie. I'll answer that question. And let me offer a couple of comments. First, one of the major tenets of our strategy is to be prudent stewards of capital. And we're doing that by balancing three factors. One is investment in our existing businesses to achieve business growth, the second is programmatic M&A, and the third is returning capital to shareholders. But with regards specifically to your question in terms of acquisitions, what we can say is they're going to be consistent with our stated strategy of growing PGIM and emerging markets, by which we can expand and extend our capabilities or our distribution or increase the scale of our existing businesses. And to your point, we'll be looking at a variety of opportunities in different sizes. But what we can also say is that regardless of size, we will evaluate the strategic and financial merits of each transaction with the obvious observation that the larger the transaction, the more financially compelling that transaction needs to be. And as we've said, we will have a programmatic approach, right, as demonstrated by the three acquisitions we did last year and as we've actually done for a couple of decades in both areas where you've seen us make numerous acquisitions in both emerging markets and asset management at various scales. Ryan Krueger : Thanks. And then from a divestiture standpoint, are you still looking to do more, whether it be in U.S. Individual Life or more in Variable Annuity? Charles Lowrey : Yes. Sure. Ryan, it's Charlie again. I'll take that. So first of all, we're focused on closing the existing transaction that you referred to. And that we've signed -- and just as an update, we're on track to close both those transactions in the first half of 2022. But we continuously see opportunities within the businesses and the existing blocks that we have to optimize capital and reduce market sensitivity while improving the consistency and the predictability of our financial results with the goal of creating additional value for shareholders. But as we've said in the past, we'll continue to be thoughtful as we progress towards the goal of becoming a more nimble, less market-sensitive and a higher-growth company. So we'll continue to look for opportunities as they arise and execute accordingly. Andrew Sullivan : Ryan, it's Andy. Let me just add in. We\u2019re making great progress on derisking in our annuities business. And as we've talked about before, that's a two-step process to derisk the legacy. Step one is all about runoff, and we are very much on track. We're seeing the expected runoff. We saw a $3.8 billion in runoff in the quarter. And we saw over $18 billion in runoff in the year. So runoff is a significant contributor to derisking. As Charlie said, step two was about doing the derisking transaction. And obviously, we're very pleased with the PALAC sale and that represents about 20% of our legacy account values. So as Charlie said, we're going to continue to explore how to further derisk the remaining legacy, but we are very focused right now on closing the Fortitude Re deal in a high-quality manner. Ryan Krueger : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the write-down that you guys took within Assurance IQ. Can you just give us a sense of the contributions? You mentioned lower earnings and cash flows as well as public peer valuations. Can you give us a sense of the contributions of each when you came up with the goodwill write-down that you took in the quarter? Kenneth Tanji : Yes. It was -- Elyse, it's Ken. It is a good combination of both. So we -- each quarter, we assess the conditions and the fair value of the business. We've been doing that since we've acquired it. We incorporated the recent experience from the Medicare annual enrollment and we looked at the updated values for multiples of peers. And so that all went in. And so it was both a combination of our updating for recent experience as well as the recent multiples in the market for peers. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thanks. And then maybe a follow-up on the capital side. So you guys mentioned that the PALAC and full-service retirement transactions are on track for a half year one close. At some point, if M&A transactions either don't materialize or don't materialize to a higher magnitude, would you guys consider raising the repurchase authorization for 2022 above the $1.5 billion? Charles Lowrey : So Elyse, this is Charlie. I think what we've said and what we'll continue to say is, again, we're going to be prudent stewards of capital. And to the extent that we can't find opportunities to execute on our strategy, we'll consider returning capital. And if you saw what we did last year, we actually increased the share buybacks by $1 billion in two $500 million segments. We've done it in the past, and we will continue to be prudent stewards of capital as we go forward and consider all our opportunities. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Your line is now live. Erik Bass : Hi, thank you. Can you talk about flow trends at PGIM in the new business pipeline heading into 2022? And are you seeing much shift in demand for fixed income given the rise in interest rates? Andrew Sullivan : Hi, Eric, it's Andy. I'll take your question. As we've discussed in the past, obviously, PGIM flows will vary quarter-to-quarter. And in the fourth quarter, we experienced overall flat flows. As you saw, our retail outflows were $3.6 billion. Market volatility really led to client rotation out of our sub-advised equities and out of our core and core plus fixed income into shorter duration strategies. That was counteracted by very strong inflows on the institutional side and in particular, in fixed income, as many pension plans allocations rotate in this type of an environment. I would say it's important to note, if you look at our fixed income business overall across both institutional and retail, overall, we had positive flows in the quarter despite facing the rising rate environment. That is a real testament to the diversification of our distribution and of our portfolio. As we've always said, we think it's very important to look at the long-term track record when it comes to flows. We have done $60 billion in flows over the last five years and we did $11 billion in 2021. Specific to your question around the retail side and what we are seeing from a fixed income perspective, we have seen $27 billion in retail flows over the last five years and our retail assets under management have doubled in that timeframe, really driven by the positive flows that we see, the alpha performance that we've seen and end markets. So we've been very successful there. Flows are an outcome of having outstanding capabilities, exceptional investment performance and great distribution, and we feel very strongly we have all of those and we'll be a net winner over time, and we've proven our ability to succeed across all different market conditions. Erik Bass : Thank you. And then can you provide some more color on your group results this quarter, both for Group Life and Disability? Andrew Sullivan : Sure, Eric, it's Andy. I'll keep going, and I'm going to split this out between Group Life and Group Disability. I'll start on the Group Life side. As we've all seen Delta and now Omicron are having a big impact on the country. U.S. deaths were higher than 3Q. So we saw 126,000 U.S. deaths in 4Q versus 94,000 in 3Q. As a top 3 life carrier, we have a big broad book of business. There's 2 effects really on the Life side that I would note. The first very similar to third quarter. And that's we have a high concentration of large retail and health care employer accounts. If you think about it, those are employers that have a high number of frontline workers that are out and about and exposed on a daily basis. And also many of those workers are in low vaccination geographies. The second effect we saw is while in this quarter, we did see a slight shift to older age, we're still seeing significant increase in incidence rates in the under 55 population. And that population tends to have larger dollar amount policies. If I shift over to the Disability side, I'd start by saying most of our impact in the quarter in the business was on the Life side. But we are seeing some impacts on the Disability side as well. I would frame this, it's what we expected to see and what we prepared for, for the Disability business. Our ratio -- benefit ratio was 87.3. That was 320 bps better than a year ago. There's really 2 effects. On the STD assets side of the business, we are seeing increased volumes. If you think about the impact that Omicron has had as an example and the isolation rules, that drives the STD in absence. But that's a fee-based business. So the effect we're seeing there really is enhanced expense showing up in the admin ratio. We staffed up to make sure that we're there for our customers because that's job 1. On the LTD side, much like third quarter, we continue to see about a 10% increase in incidents and about a 10% increase in severity. But again, it's what we expected, and it is what we prepared for from a claims management perspective. So we're just proud to be able to deliver on our promises to our customers. And as the pandemic subsides or as it flows into being more of an endemic, we know that our benefit ratios will come back into the normal range. Operator : Your next question is coming from Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse. Andrew Kligerman : Want to kind of shift back to M&A. As I think about the Prudential over the last 2 decades, the company has done a lot of excellent M&As. But the Assurance IQ, which -- with this write-down today, kind of puts a little bit of a shade on it. And Charlie, you've talked about programmatic M&A, being prudent. So what I'd like to know is how does the Assurance IQ acquisition, how does that I think you think about acquisitions going forward, particularly in terms of accretion dilution? Charles Lowrey : Sure. It's Charlie. So let me take that, Andrew. Let me take a step back and explain exactly why we did the assurance transaction and the function it plays within our business mix. Assurance is a young and innovative company that it is completely aligned with our purpose and our strategy. It's helping us expand our addressable market which is something we want to do and increase access to more customers, especially a customer base that's traditionally been underserved by our industry, and that's absolutely aligned with our purpose. Secondly, it's a digitally-based platform, frankly, in which we were underinvested and is a new space for us, but one that we wanted very much to be in. And third, from a strategic perspective, it's helping us to reduce market sensitivity by increasing our mix of fee-based earnings which is entirely consistent with what we talked about of becoming a more nimble, less market-sensitive and higher-growth company. Now as we look forward, as I mentioned earlier in the call that the acquisitions we'll be making, they are going to be in PGIM and emerging markets, and they'll be focused on -- will be focused on acquiring more mature businesses, again, by which we can expand and extend our capabilities or our distribution or our scale over time. And this is absolutely in our wheelhouse, right? This is what we've been doing for decades in both emerging markets and asset management. And have made, I won't say hundreds, but tens of successful acquisitions over that time period. So we feel very good about the strategic merits of the Assurance deal and the role it plays within our company. Andrew Kligerman : And any comment on accretion dilution you might add to that? Charles Lowrey : Sure. Let me talk about the metrics that we use for a moment. So when we think about acquisitions from both -- we think about them both from a strategic and a financial perspective. And strategic perspective, we look to add capabilities, as I said, such as product or distribution or increasing scale in a market or country. And from a financial standpoint, we look at a variety of metrics when assessing potential acquisitions such as earnings contribution and growth, et cetera. Now obviously, the larger the transaction, the more compelling the financial aspects of the transaction has to be. But importantly, I think our focus is on becoming a higher growth, again, less margin-sensitive and more nimble business, and we're going to continue to be extremely thoughtful and disciplined goal of creating value for all our stakeholders. Andrew Kligerman : Okay. Got it. And just real quickly on the expenses. It looks great that you're targeting $750 million in savings by '23. And that's -- I think you've completed 635 so far per the slides, and that's up from an initial 500. Do you think beyond that, you could do more in expense saves? Kenneth Tanji : Andrew, it's Ken. We've made excellent progress, both in terms of not just gaining efficiencies and lowering costs, but also building capabilities. And as we have done that on an accelerated basis relative to our initial targets, we remain certainly focused, again, both on building capabilities, but also gaining efficiency to drive growth going forward. We're very much on track to achieve $750 million by 2023. And at this point, we've really institutionalized both capabilities but also a mindset across the company of continuous improvement. And we're getting good payback on our initiative costs. So we expect to maintain a budget for that and also maintain this discipline going forward. Right now, we're focused on achieving that $750 million by 2023, and that's our main objective. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Thomas Gallagher : Just a question on sort of sources and uses of capital. How should we think about the $4.5 billion of proceeds plus coming from the deals? How much of that do you think is free and clear for you to use? How much do you think you might need to use to bolster capital levels, if any of it is? I ask only because just looking at the HoldCo levels, I guess you're getting closer to the low end of the target now. I'm wondering if you want to bolster that back up to the top end. And also maybe any comments you have at any subsidiary levels that you'd like to strengthen capital, if at all, or you find across the board there? And any debt reduction? Kenneth Tanji : Yes. Tom, it's Ken. I'll take that. You should think of that $4 billion of or more proceeds coming in from our 2 transactions as free and clear and readily deployable. It will quickly move to the holding company upon the close of the transaction. And just in general, we've had a very consistent approach to capital management. Our businesses are generating free cash flow. And also last year, we reduced debt. So that we thought it was a good time to reduce debt. And so we certainly have debt capacity as well. And now we also have the $4 billion of proceeds coming in. So we feel really good about our capital position and our liquidity and our flexibility and including being well positioned to meet our objective of returning $11 billion to shareholders over the 3-year period 2021 to 2023. Thomas Gallagher : Got you. Thanks, Ken. And then my follow-up is just I was looking at your supplement and saw that you had operating debt of $5.6 billion that was issued out of the holding company. Now I guess I've always typically thought about operating debt getting issued out of the operating subs, not out of the holding company because it's kind of higher-rated entity. But can you talk a little bit about what is that exactly, the operating debt that's issued out of the holding company? Kenneth Tanji : Yes. So we consider operating debt to be funding that fund sort of a specific asset or structure that where the cash flows from that asset or structure will pay off the debt. And some examples would be within our PGIM business. We do co and seed investments that are funded both with capital to support the risk of those investments, but also operating debt. And we find that efficient to do that from the holding company. Our PGIM business also has an agency mortgage business, where we fund loans from time to time, again, where those loans would support that operating debt. So those are 2 examples. But again, it's where specific assets or structures will support that debt. Operator : Next question is coming from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler. John Barnidge : My first question, is there any way to bifurcate VII between marks and realized gains? Kenneth Tanji : Yes. We do look at that and you should think of it as variable investment income is both balanced between cash coming from distributions as well as appreciation in the mark-to-market. Usually, it's pretty balanced. Last year, a little bit more appreciation than cash just given the move in the market. John Barnidge : Great. And my follow-up, given the focus on large and jumbo within group, how much of the contracts there have seen pricing increases since COVID emerged? Andrew Sullivan : So John, it's Andy. I'll take your question. So I don't have the exact percentage at my fingertips, but I'll make some high-level commentary. So as I think you're very aware, those contracts renew anywhere from every 2 years to say, every 5 years, and it's very much based on the size of the business with the smaller cases renewing more frequently every 2 years and large national accounts renewing approximately every 5 years. 80% of our group insurance block of business is national accounts. So our renewal cycle, they would tend to be more towards the longer end of that spectrum. From a pricing perspective, now that we're entering the third year of the pandemic and it's probable at least that this will go from pandemic to endemic, we very much felt that we needed to take our COVID experience from the last 24 months and to put it into our new business and renewal business pricing. And we have done that on both the Life and Disability side. So that business will reprice over the next few years. Operator : Our next question is coming from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Tracy Benguigui : I wanted to circle back to your comment about completing a $5 billion PRT deal, the fourth largest in market history. So I recall, Andy, in a group meeting, you mentioned that more competitors have entered the space something like 15 to 20, and probably 6 or 7 of those are consistently trying to do these over $1 billion transaction. So I'm just wondering if pricing is getting too frothy for these mega deals and have your view of IRR change due to competition? Andrew Sullivan : Yes. Tracy, so it's Andy. Thank you for your question. So yes, we did 2 transactions in the fourth quarter for $210 million. And as you noted, that was on the heels of a very successful transaction in 3Q, which ended up being the largest transaction of the year and we were one of the top writers of the year. I guess I'd make 2 comments. One, the market outlook here for the size of the market remains very strong. The funding levels are at the strongest they've been in 10 years, funded status at the end of November was at 98%. So we believe that the market is going to stay large. And as a pioneer and a leader in the space, to your point, despite it becoming more competitive, there are more competitors, we are still seeing that we -- by being disciplined with underwriting and pricing, we could pick our spots. And we could pick our spots and given the size of the market, we'll win our fair share and we'll be able to continue to grow that business, thanks to our brand and our capabilities. Tracy Benguigui : That's very helpful. And here's like, I guess, a bigger picture question on wage inflation. I guess, on one hand, that could maybe boost sales. But on the other hand, there are these talent shortages. So I'm wondering how that may also impact expenses, if you could provide some color? Robert Falzon : Tracy, it's Rob. I'll take a first stab at that. And Andy, if you want to jump in, please feel free to do so. I guess, Tracy, I'd start by bringing it up a level, which is the most significant impact of inflation would be on rates. And that would be -- if inflation actually leads to higher rates, that's a good thing for the industry and for us included as a part of that. With respect to operating costs, your specific question, one, I would note that our ongoing efficiency initiatives will help to mitigate any impact that we would have on increases that come through. Secondly, we are quite comfortable that we have sufficient pricing power in most -- in our most material products and markets that if the -- that to the extent there's a residual impact, we'll be able to incorporate that into pricing. And I'd add that while inflation is a macro factor that we're very much looking at how it influences the upcoming year, there are a number of other things happening from a macro standpoint beyond inflation. And we believe that there will be drivers actually to tailwinds that will get created for our businesses, things like higher rates and an improving outlook for COVID. Andy, I don't know if you want to add anything more specific on a business level basis. Andrew Sullivan : Maybe the only thing I would add is, Tracy, both our U.S. Insurance and Retirement businesses and our PGIM business, we're big, we're broad, we're well diversified. And there are plenty of spots in our business system where this environment is very good. And I just mentioned, we are one of the largest real estate investors in the world, # 3 by assets under management. And obviously, an inflationary environment could be very helpful for that business. Operator : Our next question is coming from Humphrey Lee from Dowling and Partners. Humphrey Lee : I just have a question related to Group Disability. In the slide deck, you talked about you looking to diversify your group insurance portfolio and looking to expand into group disability and voluntary product. Can you just talk about how you are planning to do that, especially with some of the industry disability results recently seeing some pressure? How do you balance growing market share at the same time achieving adequate pricing? Andrew Sullivan : Sure, Humphrey. It's Andy. So let me first bring it up a level to talk about how do we think about this strategically. So as we've talked about expanding our addressable market and bringing more solutions to more people, we continue to believe that the workplace is a great place to grow because of the reach and access that it gives us. We've been executing on a strategy in our group business very consistently over the last 5 years to grow and in particular, to grow in certain spots, to grow in middle market, so smaller cases, to grow our disability block and to grow our voluntary capabilities in block so that we diversify the business further. And that makes a lot of sense because a lot of clients in the group space bundle. As I said earlier, the majority of our business at Group Insurance is large national account and the majority is life. So we feel we have a lot of room to grow. And in essence, we're going to stay the course on our value prop. We've invested quite significantly in strengthening our overall value prop, both our financial wellness capabilities but also our core fundamental capabilities in both Life and Disability. Your question about how do you do it in an environment like we're in? It's all about discipline, right? It's about being disciplined in pricing and underwriting and making sure that you -- especially on the Disability side, that you maintain strong disability claims expertise and staffing, so that you could properly manage the business in an environment where we're seeing increased incidence and severity. Humphrey Lee : So my follow-up to that is in kind of your strategic review, you talked about M&A area would be asset management and emerging markets. But given your interest now in expanding disability and voluntary benefits in the work site, is now group insurance be in other area of potential M&A? Or are you still sticking to kind of asset management in emerging markets? Charles Lowrey : So Humphrey, this is Charlie. For now, our concentration is going to be on asset management and emerging markets. Those are 2 areas where we think we have we can benefit significantly from the increase in capabilities and scale in the markets in which we already are doing business. And so that's going to be our focus in the -- certainly in the near to medium term. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies. Suneet Kamath : Charlie, a year ago, we talked about wanting to increase the earnings contribution from growth businesses from, I think the math was 18% to over 30%. And I'm just wondering, is that still on the table because it would seem that, that might be difficult without M&A, but I was just wanting to get your thoughts on whether you can get there organically. Charles Lowrey : Sure. That remains our goal in 2 to 3 years. But as you point out, we'll be doing it through a combination of a couple of things. One is -- or 3 things, really. One is organic growth. So we will be continuing to invest in our businesses. One is to get there. And the third is really the dispositions of either lower growth or market-sensitive businesses. And you've seen us begin to execute on that with the 2 transactions that we're going to close this year. And that's all within, again, the context of being prudent stewards of capital, of investing in our business, having programmatic M&A and returning capital to shareholders. So the short answer of your question is, yes, that still remains our goal, and we'll do it through a combination of factors. Suneet Kamath : And is it fair to say that the M&A piece might need to be the biggest of the 3? Or do you think it's sort of evenly distributed across the 3? Charles Lowrey : It's hard to say whether -- what the percentages will be. It will depend on the opportunities we see, both organically and inorganically, and the dispositions that we make. So it's sort of a multivariable equation, if you will, but we're looking to balance that equation and do it thoughtfully and prudently. Suneet Kamath : Got it. Makes sense. And then I just wanted to ask about international sales, if we focus on Japan and Gibraltar. It looks like sales have kind of been flattish. Just wondering if -- or is the reason sort of the COVID impacts and lack of face-to-face or do you have to do some more work in terms of the product set that you guys are offering, both in Gibraltar and the Life Planner model. Scott Sleyster : Suneet, this is Scott. Let me give a little more context on why the sales are down, and then I can talk about what we're doing. First of all, our bank channel is subject to a higher level of variability and given when there are shifts in the competitive market. And given both COVID-related headwinds, but also higher U.S. dollar interest rates, the regional banks have shifted to easier to sell investment products. As you know, we maintain a strong pricing discipline on deposit products, and we've always concentrated our efforts on selling recurring premium death protection products in that channel. There was a second factor during the fourth quarter, where we're making some product shelf adjustments in our Life Consultant channel, and we're in the process of updating our U.S. dollar annuity offerings and we expect the majority of the new products to be in place by the end of the first quarter. So I think that explains why we were down. The actions that we're taking, in the bank channel, look, we intend to maintain our discipline, but we do think the market will evolve over time, especially as COVID restrictions are relaxed. Additionally, in Japan, we continue to go front and center with our death protection products. But increasingly, we've been adding to our product line with more retirement, wealth transfer and health products. And we believe, given those product line increases, coupled with really high-quality distribution there in Life Planners and Life Consultants, we'll be able to counteract this. We're actually pretty optimistic about going forward there. Operator : Next question is coming from Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Alexander Scott : Yes. I guess for my first one, I just had a follow-up on International. When I think through sales and persistency, it seems for at least the near term, I think premium growth will kind of continue to be the same or if not a little lower than you've had. And when I look at earnings over the last few years, it seems like G&A expenses declining has allowed for you guys to defend earnings in a pretty strong way. And I just wanted to probe there a little bit and understand what have you been doing to take expenses out? And is that something you can continue to do to help earnings in international? Scott Sleyster : Yes. There's a couple of different comments I'll give there. First of all, just like the U.S. transformation, the International Business, Japan and others have been looking for ways to be more efficient and to use automation and other activities to control costs. Also in some of our emerging markets, we're experiencing faster growth. So we're starting to see some scale benefits. And then finally, we've done a good job of cost control at the corporate center level. That being said, I think our opportunities to grow earnings internationally are much more driven by the revenue actions that I alluded to in the product actions and the distribution force actions that are taking place in both LP and LC. So we're always going to be disciplined on the expense front, but I think it's more of the product and the emerging market growth areas that we think will be more important going forward. Lastly, I would say, of course, COVID has made it more challenging to recruit Life Planners and Life Consultants. And we do expect that to ease as the pandemic eases or turns into an endemic. Alexander Scott : Got it. And then maybe for a follow-up, there was a long-term care insurance underwriter that had a pretty sizable gross charge associated with reimbursement policies and the impacts of inflation. And I just wanted to find out from you all, what do you feel like your exposure is to that? And will that have any impact on your stat filings and the required reserves? And is there any material impact to cash flow we should consider? Kenneth Tanji : No. The short answer is no. We do factor in inflation into our assumptions, and we're well positioned for an elevated level of inflation in the near term. And we continue to see claims experience consistent with our assumptions and actually a little bit more favorable. Operator : Our next question is coming from Mike Zaremski from Wolfe Research. Michael Zaremski : Okay, great. Just one question and a follow-up on the pension marketplace comments. You mentioned that funding levels at their highest levels looks like since the great financial crisis, but not above 100 yet. Just curious, is there kind of like a magic number, given there's costs associated with it, pension funding levels, let's say, we had a good market in -- macro market in '22, if they got to like 103, 105. Or is there a magic number that would kind of cause sales to an uplift? Andrew Sullivan : Mike, it's Andy. I'll take your question. And the answer is, we don't believe so. At 98%, plan sponsors are very willing to lean in and to transact. I think plan sponsors, when they're in this range and they see the volatility in the marketplace, it really drives the desire to transact and to derisk their pension plans. So there's no magic number. Having said that, we think at these levels, we're going to continue to see robust markets. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ve reached end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lowrey for any further or closing comments. Charles Lowrey : Thank you, and thank you for joining us today. 2021 was a year of transformation for Prudential in which we reached a record high level of after-tax operating earnings, distributed a record amount back to shareholders and made real progress towards becoming a more nimble, less market-sensitive and higher-growth company. As we look ahead to 2022 and beyond, we are focused on creating and driving growth and becoming a global leader in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security. We are both excited about and confident in our strategy and our ability to create value for all our stakeholders by building even further upon our progress. We look forward to sharing more with you along the way, and thank you again for joining us today. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

Now, I'll turn it over to Charlie. Charlie Lowrey : Thank you, Bob, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. We delivered solid operating earnings for the first quarter, including strong variable investment income that more than offset the impact of elevated mortality from COVID-19. We have also recently achieved multiple significant milestones in our transformation process to become a higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble company. These milestones included continued execution on our plans to reposition our businesses. We completed two key divestitures and announced another programmatic acquisition. We continue to invest in our businesses to further enhance the customer experience and expand solutions to support sustainable long-term growth. And we also further advanced the progress on our $750 million cost savings program. We are pleased with the pace of these initiatives, which are well supported by our rock-solid balance sheet and help us expand access to investing insurance and retirement security for our customers and clients around the world. I'll provide an update on each of these areas before turning it over to Rob and Ken. Moving to Slide 3. At the beginning of April, we successfully completed the divestiture of our full service retirement business and the sale of a significant portion of our legacy variable annuities block. Together, these dispositions reduced the overall market sensitivity of our businesses by approximately 20%, while enabling us to further sharpen our focus on higher growth opportunities, including programmatic M&A and asset management and emerging markets. To that end, we agreed during the quarter to acquire a minority stake in Alexander Forbes, a leading provider of financial advice, retirement, investment and wealth management in South Africa. This deal provides access to essential financial tools and further expands our footprint in a strategically important market. We also continue to focus on enhancing customer experiences and creating solutions to drive sustainable growth across our businesses and to address the evolving needs of our customers. For example, FlexGuard continued to build momentum, and we are excited about its future and our broader suite of complementary annuity products, including FlexGuard Income. In Individual Life, we continue to expand our reach to a broader range of customers and further address the $12 trillion life insurance coverage gap with the introduction of a final expense product. And we are also making similar growth investments to further enhance customer experience and expand solutions across our international businesses. In Japan, we are focusing on evolving our product suite to meet the increasing retirement and inheritance needs of the aging Japan population. In Brazil, we are diversifying our customer offerings with the introduction of a new stand-alone accident and health product. And in China, we introduced Grow Partners, a digital sales platform that we are extending to distribution partners and directly to consumers, beginning with a medical cash benefit plan. Turning to Slide 4. We continue to make steady progress towards achieving our cost savings target of $750 million at the end of 2023, while improving customer experience. During the first quarter, we realized $170 million in cost savings for a total of $680 million of run rate savings to date since 2019. Turning now to Slide 5. Prudential's rock solid balance sheet provides significant financial flexibility to execute on our transformation strategy while returning substantial capital to shareholders. Our robust financial position includes : a high-quality, well-diversified investment portfolio; a capital position that supports a AA financial strength rating; and $3.6 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the first quarter, as well as over $4 billion of additional proceeds from divestitures that we have already received in the second quarter. In addition to supporting our strategy for sustainable, profitable growth, we remain committed to returning $11 billion of capital to shareholders between 2021 and the end of 2023. As part of this program, we have increased our dividend by 4% in the first quarter of 2022, our 14th consecutive annual dividend increase. Before turning it over to Rob, I'd like to update you on a few of our recent ESG initiatives, which we consider integral to our purpose of solving the financial challenges of our changing world. First, relating to the war in Ukraine. In addition to providing financial assistance to humanitarian and non-profit organizations supporting people impacted by the war, we divested our modest level of Russian financial assets in our investment portfolio. Closer to home, we've adopted a hybrid working model that combines the benefits of in-person collaboration and remote work flexibility to support our employees and help us attract and retain talent. Our hybrid work model will enable us to reduce our total home office properties in the U.S. by approximately 50% over time as we invest in the redesign of 600,000 square feet of office space that will be optimized for collaborative and hybrid work, most of which was completed during the past two years. In addition to helping us achieve our cost savings targets, our real estate and hybrid work strategies are one of the several factors that will contribute to a 2050 net zero emissions target. Alongside these efforts, we are also finding new opportunities to support our home city in Newark, New Jersey, including new investments in local commerce, Live Workspaces for resident small business owners and additional opportunities to foster local home ownership. We look forward to continuing to support the city's revitalization. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for more specific details on our business performance. Rob Falzon : Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, U.S. and international businesses. I'll begin on Slide 6 with our financial results for the first quarter of 2022. Our pretax adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion or $3.17 per share on an after-tax basis and reflected a benefit from variable investment income, which exceeded the net mortality impact from COVID-19. PGIM, our global investment manager had higher asset management fees than the year ago quarter. However, these were more than offset by lower other related revenues as well as investments made to support business growth. Results of our U.S. businesses increased 12% from the year ago quarter and reflected higher net investment spread, including benefits from variable investment income and rising interest rates, more favorable underwriting, primarily due to declining COVID-19-related mortality experience and lower expenses, primarily driven by our cost savings initiatives, partially offset by lower fee income resulting from the runoff of our legacy variable annuities. Earnings in our international businesses decreased by 8%, reflecting lower net investment results, less favorable underwriting results and lower earnings from joint venture investments, partially offset by continued business growth. Turning to Slide 7. PGIM, our top 10 global investment manager has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, alternatives, real estate and equities. PGIM's long-term investment performance remains attractive with more than 84% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last 3-, 5- and 10-year periods. PGIM experienced third-party net outflows of $4.3 billion in the quarter as institutional net inflows, driven by fixed income and real estate, were more than offset by retail outflows, driven by mutual fund investors rebalancing out of fixed income due to rising rates and inflation expectations. As the investment engine of Prudential, the success and growth of PGIM and of our U.S. and international insurance and retirement businesses are mutually enhancing. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise and access to institutional and other sources of private capital or a competitive advantage, helping our businesses bring enhanced solutions, innovation and more value to our customers. And our insurance and retirement businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated flows and unique access to insurance liabilities that complement its successful third-party track record of growth. PGIM's asset management fees increased by 2% compared to the year ago quarter, reflecting positive third-party flows and a continued shift towards higher fee-yielding strategies, including the benefits from recent acquisitions over the past year, partially offset by the impact of rising rates. As rates rise in the near term, investor demand for some fixed income strategies could continue to moderate. However, over the longer term, a stabilized higher rate environment would be a positive for fixed income demand and PGIM's business. We continue to grow our alternatives in private credit business, which has assets under management of approximately $240 billion, across private credit, real estate equity and debt and private equity secondaries, and benefits from our global scale and market-leading capabilities. Notably, across PGIM's private platform, we deployed nearly $10 billion of capital, up 20% from the year ago quarter, reflecting the continued strong environment for both real estate and private credit. Now turning to Slide 8. Our U.S. businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income and benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to shift our business mix towards higher growth and less market-sensitive products and businesses to transform our capabilities and cost structure and to further expand our addressable markets. Our product pivots have worked well, as demonstrated by strong sales of recently launched simplified solutions. Our FlexGuard and FlexGuard income products represented $1.4 billion or over 90% of total individual annuity sales in the first quarter. We continue to exercise pricing discipline informed by changing market conditions and our sales benefit from having a strong and trusted brand and a highly effective distribution team. Our individual life sales also reflect our earlier product pivot strategy with variable life products representing approximately 70% of sales for the quarter. We also successfully completed the national rollout of our Individual Life Express terms product with a large national distributor and recently launched a final expense product continuing to expand our middle market presence. And we are focused on enhancing customer experience through digital tools, including automated underwriting, resulting in more than 90% utilization for eligible policies in the first quarter of 2022. Our retirement business has market-leading capabilities, which drove funded pension risk transfer sales of $700 million in the quarter. And our group insurance business reflected sales growth of 5% compared to the prior year quarter driven by an increase in supplemental health sales. Turning to Slide 9. Our international businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other businesses aimed at expanding in high-growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high-quality service and expanding our geographic coverage and product offerings. Our needs-based approach and mortality protection focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. We continue to enhance customer experience and agent support, including through digital tools. The value we provide customers was recently recognized by the 2022 J.D. Power life insurance customer satisfaction survey. Prudential of Japan was ranked number one in all three categories : contract; servicing; and claims. In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a carefully selected portfolio of businesses in regions where customer needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market-leading businesses and partnerships and where the Prudential enterprise can add value. In the first quarter, we continued to focus on expanding product and business capabilities in emerging markets to meet the evolving needs of our customers. We launched a new accident and health product in the large and growing Brazil market, and continue to expand our wellness platform across Latin America. In addition, as Charlie discussed earlier, we are pleased to expand our presence in Africa with the announcement to acquire a minority interest in Alexander Forbes through our existing partnership with leapfrog investments. As we look ahead, we're well positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We plan to continue to invest in growth businesses and markets, deliver industry-leading customer experiences and create the next generation of financial solutions to better serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken. Ken Tanji : Thanks, Rob. I'll begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the second quarter of 2022 relative to our first quarter results. Pretax adjusted operating income in the first quarter was $1.6 billion, and resulted in earnings per share of $3.17 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense of how our second quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items : first, variable investment income outperformed expectations in the first quarter by $275 million; next, we adjust underwriting experience by a net $165 million. This adjustment includes a placeholder for COVID-19 claims experienced in the second quarter of $40 million for our U.S. businesses based on 25,000 COVID-19-related fatalities in the U.S. and a placeholder of $25 million for our international businesses. While we have provided this placeholder for COVID-19-related claims experience, the actual impact will depend on a variety of factors such as infection and fatality rates, geographic and demographic mix and the effectiveness of vaccines; and last, we expect other items to be $95 million lower in the second quarter, primarily as a result of completing the sales of both our full service retirement business and a block of legacy variable annuities. These items combined get us to a baseline of $2.75 per share for the second quarter. I'll note that if you exclude items specific to the second quarter, earnings per share would be $2.91. A modest decline from recent quarters, primarily from the completed sales of businesses, and the proceeds from these sales will provide flexibility for future capital deployment. I would also note a few other items : first, due to the rise in interest rates, we no longer anticipate a reduction in net investment income from portfolio reinvestment. The benefit from a rising rate environment on our investment income compounds over time as we reinvest our portfolio. However, the reductions in assets under management and related income and our fee-based businesses occurs more immediately. In addition, as a result of our derisking actions, the sensitivity of our adjusted operating income to markets will be reduced by approximately 20% on an annual basis. We also expect to report a gain on the sale of the legacy variable annuity block and adjusted operating income in the second quarter. Impacts from the annual review of actuarial and economic assumptions will also be reported in the second quarter. In accordance with our established practice, we have a comprehensive process that will include, among other things, the review of long-term interest rates, inflation, COVID mortality experience and updated industry data that may impact our assumptions. And finally, as a result of new foreign tax credit regulations, we are expecting an effective tax rate in the range of 21% to 23% for 2022. While we have provided these items to consider, please note there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the second quarter. Turning to Slide 11. We continue to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position continues to support a AA financial strength rating, and we have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets were $3.6 billion and within our $3 billion to $5 billion liquidity target range. And other sources of funds include free cash flow from our businesses, proceeds from divested businesses and contingent capital facilities. Turning to Slide 12 and in summary. We are executing on our plans to reposition our businesses. We are on track to achieve our targeted cost savings and our rock solid balance sheet provides financial flexibility to execute on our transformation and thoughtfully deploy capital. Now, I'll turn it to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Your line is now live. Erik Bass : Can you provide some more color on the net flow drivers for PGIM in the quarter? And with interest rates continuing to move higher, can you talk about how this is affecting fixed income demand from both retail and institutional clients? Andy Sullivan : Sure. Eric, it's Andy. As we've discussed in the past, PGIM flows are going to vary from quarter-to-quarter, and we're very focused and stay focused on our long-term track record. We're very proud of the fact that 18 of the last 19 years, we've had positive third-party flows. In the first quarter, we did experience $4.3 billion in net outflows. It was a challenging quarter for the fixed income U.S. mutual fund industry in general, and we were similarly affected. We saw $4.6 billion of retail outflows, almost entirely driven by retail investor repositioning out of fixed income. On the institutional side, we saw a positive $300 million driven by flows into public fixed income and real estate. We continue to think this is a good proof of our diversification. And on the institutional side, we see algorithms actually positioning into fixed income given the rising rate environment. As we step back, our long-term track record remains very strong. We saw $55 billion in flows between 2017 and 2021, with $27 billion of that being on the retail side. That being said, we do think it's fair to expect continued pressure on the retail fixed income industry as the rates and spreads continue to rise, but that's a near-term effect. As Rob said upfront, higher rates are good after the transitory period for the fixed income business. We're very confident in the fact that we have the right products, the right strategies, exceptional long-term investment performance and great distribution and will be a net winner over time. One thing I wanted to add today, when we talk about flows is more around the private business that Rob talked about given that those are higher fee rate businesses. We continue to benefit from a very strong market for real estate and private credit. We were able to put $9.6 billion to work in the first quarter across real estate at PGIM Private Capital raise another $1.8 billion. So, we are confident in PGIM and confident in a long-term track record. Erik Bass : I appreciate all the color there. And then, I was hoping that you could talk about the implications of the weaker yen for your Japan business in terms of earnings, capital and the demand for foreign currency-denominated products? And I realize that you're hedged for 2022, but can you just remind us what percentage of your earnings are in yen? Ken Tanji : Yes. Erik, it's Ken. I'll start off on sort of the financial implications. And you're right, we do have a pretty established and, we think, a very effective hedging program. But first, it's important to know that of our -- because of the success of us in the Japan market with U.S. dollar products, a substantial portion of our reserves and our assets backing those reserves are U.S. dollar-denominated. And that in combination with the fact that as a Japanese company, our expenses are almost exclusively denominated in yen. The combination of that results in our income from our Japan business being mostly -- nearly all of our U.S. -- our income in Japan is U.S. dollar denominated. What income we have denominated in yen, we hedged over three years. And we have a net equity capital hedge position as well. So, it's a long-established hedging approach, and we think it performs well, both from an accounting and economic standpoint. Erik Bass : Got it. And for the product demand with just -- you sell a lot of foreign countries denominated products start\u2026 Ken Tanji : I'll hand that over to Scott. Scott Sleyster : Eric, this is Scott. Yes, in the -- it's a little bit of a mixed bag or a dislocation, if you will. But for the most part, the higher U.S. interest rates, which I think are related to the currency is good for demand, as Rob said, and I think it's good for Prudential overall. But as investors in Japan are looking for more attractive yielding products, that's good. In the short run, though, and when the currency moves, it does make the price tag of the purchase a little more expensive. And we have found in the bank channel where there's an intermediary in there. You may see slightly higher surrenders because of the run-up in the dollar. But net-net, we think it's generally a positive for us. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Your line is now live. Tom Gallagher : Ken, a question on the holdco cash and just overall capital generation in the quarter, if I look at the -- it looks like you issued $1 billion of junior debt in the quarter, so that would be an inflow, and you got $300 million of cash from the dispositions, and I guess, $4 billion-plus is still closed after the quarter, but that's $1.3 billion. And then, I look at your holdco cash balance, it didn't change versus 4Q. So, just curious, how I should think about that? It doesn't -- looking at it that way, it doesn't look like there were much in the way of dividends that came up during the quarter. Were there capital needs that came up in the subs? Or is it a timing issue? Can you help us think through like the capital generation in the quarter and what that should look like going forward? Ken Tanji : Yes, Tom. Yes, we did issue $1 billion of hybrid debt is actually early in the quarter and before the rise in rates and before the spreads widened out. So we're happy with that execution. And that's part of our process to prefund upcoming debt that we would like to either -- that's either maturing or we're going to call. And we do have about $1 billion of hybrid debt that's going to be callable in September. So, we sort of earmarked that $1 billion for that purpose. Liquid assets at the holding company will fluctuate due to timing. Typically, that's within our $3 billion to $5 billion target. But in the first quarter, as is in typical with most first quarters for us, subsidiary dividends and cash flow were low, and then they tend to be greater in the second part of the year. And so, part of that is just timing. But we also did make a capital contribution to a new reinsurance subsidiary that we have -- that we've established in Bermuda in the first quarter. And that will give us the ability to reinsure policies from PICA, our U.S. insurance company to that new subsidiary, to give us more economic reserving and greater capital efficiency over time. So, over time, it was -- it did require some capital to initially fund -- but over time, we feel good about that in terms of giving us much more balance sheet efficiency going forward? And then also just keep in mind, we did receive $4 billion from the sale of full service and PALAC in April. Tom Gallagher : Got you. And just a follow-up there, Ken. Can you comment on the size of the new reinsurance vehicle that's, I guess, ranged on the captive that you referenced? Ken Tanji : Yes. We initially capitalized it with $800 million. So that was the amount of initial capital that we put in. And although it's a requirement now, it's actually going to provide capital efficiency in the future. So you can think about that as a net positive to our capital efficiency over time. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Suneet Kamath : Great. First question just on strategy. I guess, Charlie, we've been talking about this objective of improving the earnings contribution from growth businesses to, I guess, over 30%. And we're a year into the strategy and haven't really seen that move all that much, at least based on the way we're calculating it. So my question is, is the plan to still sort of get there over the next couple of years? And is it going to take something more than programmatic M&A in order to accomplish that? Charlie Lowrey : Sure. So, we can't control the markets, but this is -- we look at it as both a numerator and a denominator issue. And we're continuing to make progress on both -- through both the acquisitions we've made, the four acquisitions we've made over the past year and the dispositions that we just completed. And so, you've seen that we've made progress with the four acquisitions and the two major dispositions. And we'll continue to execute on the strategy. We have a sense of urgency. We're going to make progress as we go forward, and we'll make progress in both ways. Suneet Kamath : And can you give us a sense on the timing of the use of the $4 billion of proceeds? Obviously, we could think about a couple of different buckets, right, M&A and/or capital return to shareholders. But now that these deals have closed, sort of over what time frame would you like to use that capital? Charlie Lowrey : Yes. Sure. So as I hope you've seen, we are operating with a sense of urgency, right? Speed is important, but we don't have a specific time ban per se. So, we're going to remain prudent stewards of capital, as we've said, and continue to evaluate programmatic acquisitions. But as we've also said and as we've done in the past, we'll return capital to shareholders if we can't find the appropriate opportunities over time. So, we're going to continue on our process. But as you've seen, we have returned capital to shareholders, and we'll continue to operate in that fashion. Suneet Kamath : Got it. If I could just sneak one more in for Ken or Rob. When we think about the individual annuity business, I think in the past, specifically thinking about the highest daily value product, I think the commentary you guys gave in the past is a rising interest rate environment, coupled with a falling equity market environment is generally not great for that business, which is the environment, obviously, we're sitting in today. So can you just talk about from a risk management perspective, how that business is holding up in this environment? Ken Tanji : Yes. Suneet, this is Ken. We've very well capitalized and reserved our business, and we have a highly effective hedging program. And that has been very effective of mitigating market impacts, both from equity markets and interest rates. And so, -- and it continues -- it was continued to be very effective in the quarter. So no change there. Operator : Your next question today is coming from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler. Your line is now live. John Barnidge : Expense ratios in both group disability and group life insurance decline. I know that some of the source of the expense saves programs, but you're also building the service COVID claims. Can you maybe dimension some of the improvement in admin expenses there between those two? Andy Sullivan : Sure, John. It's Andy. So our admin expense ratio for the quarter was 15.6%. That was almost a 4% improvement from Q4, but was basically flat from Q1 of last year. I would just keep in mind, fourth quarter was elevated by some one-time compensation expenses, so there's some seasonality effects going on. We are starting to see the beginnings of our core expense improvement of impacting our businesses. When I think about that, I would say the expense saves are more attributable to the overall expense work. The incidents and severity in the business remain elevated, even though they have started to come back towards normal, they remain elevated, and we maintain the higher level of staffing in both our claim and our call centers. So, we would expect that the admin ratio will stay elevated for the remainder of the year. John Barnidge : Great. And then my follow-up question. Can you talk about maybe how higher rates have changed the conversation around pension risk transfer activity with potential counterparties? Andy Sullivan : So, John, it's Andy. So, we -- maybe let me talk about the current quarter and then I'll go into looking forward. So, as you're aware, this is a very transaction-oriented business. And first quarter tends to be light, and that's kind of what we saw with the industry. We think the first quarter was somewhere around $5.3 billion. We were very pleased, as Rob said, that we did two deals for $700 million. Overall, as we look forward for the rest of the year, we believe it's going to be a strong year, and I think the overall industry level should clock in around $40 billion. The fact is, funded status hit a record high in February of 102%. And if you add on top of that, the rise in rates and then the volatile environment that we're in, all of that bolsters sponsors' desire and proclivity to transact. So this is a big market that it has become more competitive, but we know that we could pick our spots and be disciplined and net-net, will grow over time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Your line is now live. Tracy Benguigui : I'm wondering if your intolerance of interest rate sensitive business changed at all considering the 10-year is nearly 3% may go up from here? Like are you thinking at all about increasing the portion of spread-based business going forward? Rob Falzon : Tracy, it's Rob. Let me take a stab at that. First, to your point, yes, rising interest rates are a good thing. They're a good thing for the industry and they're a good thing for us as a company, both because it allows us to be more competitive in providing a value proposition to our customers and our products and also because it has a positive impact on our portfolio yield. Having said that, it is our desire to have a mix of businesses and products that are less market-sensitive and less market-sensitive across market cycles. So our focus is on trying to operate at the intersection of both shareholder and customer value propositions that are sustainable throughout cycles. If you're asking about how we think about the impact of higher interest rates on the long-term reversion rate that we have in our assumptions, obviously, that drives pricing and valuation. We do our assumption updates in the second quarter, probably not something -- anything specific we can say about that. But maybe I'll turn it over to Ken and he can comment more generally. Ken Tanji : Yes. Thanks, Rob. Yes. The long-term interest rates and our assumptions are something that we do look at in our assumption updates annually. We do that by looking at multiple perspectives sort of from an array of economists and banks and asset managers. We also look at the forward curve, which as you know, has increased recently. And we set our assumption kind of close to the median of that. And also with our assumption update, inflation has risen. We factor near-term inflation into our reserve setting as well as for long-term inflation as well. And then part of our assumption update will obviously cover mortality and other policyholder behavior as well, including not just our own experience, but anything we get in terms of new data from other sources in the industry. We did recently receive a new industry study that indicates experience is more adverse in some of our assumptions of our U.S. life insurance business. We're evaluating this information and its applicability to our business. And to the extent that it would cause an increase in reserves or a decline in earnings. So, that -- all that work is underway, it will conclude later in the quarter, and that will be part of what we report in the second quarter. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. Great. I'm also wondering as unfavorable FX impacts change your view right now on increasing international business through M&A. Scott Sleyster : Tracy, this is Scott. I'll go ahead and take that one. I guess in the short answer, I'd say, not really. We're seeking to build out a well-diversified emerging markets portfolio of businesses. And we see local currency weakness as an opportunity to improve our U.S. dollar purchase economics, if you will. But that being said, we do factor in the potential for currency risk over time by using risk-adjusted discount rates in our valuation estimates when we think about these businesses. So I would say if you take a step back, we'd actually say, it's a net positive. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. Sorry, if I could just sneak one quick one, that mention of that reinsurance entity established in Bermuda for the type of business. I'm just wondering, is that reinsurance flow or the back book? Is that being reinsured? Ken Tanji : Initially, we're going to use it for reinsuring some of our in-force business, but we are gaining experience in Bermuda and our ability to use it -- we will be considering strategies, potentially, for flow in the future. Operator : Your next question is coming from Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Alex Goldman : I had a follow-up just on Suneet's question and the answer there. And when you mentioned that the business mix shift, part of it's the denominator, I guess -- I think part of that is also being communicated is the runoff of the annuities business over time or at least the sort of more legacy piece of the annuities business. And now that, that transaction is closed, I was just wondering if you could give us a more firm way to think about how we should expect the earnings power to run off or whether some of the new product growth can offset that? Ken Tanji : Alex, it's Ken. Yes, our traditional -- we've -- we're no longer issuing traditional variable annuities. So it is running off. And after our -- the sale of about 20% of our block of business with PALAC, it will continue to run off at about $3 billion a quarter is what you saw in the quarter. So, you can kind of think about that as kind of $12 billion to $15 billion a year, and that's about an 8% runoff a year. So that, combined with the PALAC business that was 20%, that over time will get us very close to our objective to reducing our income from traditional variable annuities, and having said that, we would think about other ways to do that as well. Alex Goldman : Got it. And then I had one more follow-up to the response on the impact of interest rates, particularly your comments on the actuarial review. The inflation impact that you mentioned, I assume that's probably long-term care and the reimbursement style policies. Could you help us think through the sensitivity to that? I mean, you've provided a lot of sensitivity around long-term care. And so, we have all of that around changes in discount rates and new money yields and so forth. But the inflation one, I've struggled to put my finger on. So even if it's just relative to rates, which is the bigger factor, any kind of commentary you can provide to help us think through that would be useful. Ken Tanji : Yes, Alex. Yes, long-term care is probably where that's most relevant in terms of inflation. We have factored in inflation, obviously, into our reserves including increases in near term, it's -- long-term inflation would be where it's more sensitive. We have provided some of those sensitivities. So -- and overall, we think it's very manageable for us. Operator : Your next question today is coming from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Elyse Greenspan : My first question is on Assurance IQ. You guys took a goodwill impairment there in the fourth quarter. And I believe at the time, you mentioned that part of the rationale for that was the lower valuation of the public peers. I noticed you didn't take another charge this quarter, and the peers have rerated subsequently lower from a few months ago. Was that to contemplate it when you took the charge in the fourth quarter? Or any update you can give us there? Ken Tanji : Yes. The charge that we took in the fourth quarter was relevant to the environment at the end of the fourth quarter. We again did a qualitative review of our -- the value of our insurance goodwill and assurance, and we did not need any further impairment. So that's where that stands. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then my second question, the group disability loss ratio was pretty strong in the quarter. Can we just get some more color there and just how you expect that to trend over the balance of the year? Andy Sullivan : Yes. Elyse, it's Andy. We very much obviously like the improvement that we saw in the disability business this quarter. It was our best benefit ratio since 2018 at 73.4%. I would frame this as what we've seen in disability, it continues to behave as we would expect and what we have been preparing for. And you always need to split this into the two different impacts. The one impact on the absence and STD side, on that side, we do continue to see a very high level of COVID-related claims. That, in general, turns into the need for the elevated staffing and claim and call. And because those are fee-oriented businesses, it shows up in our more from an elevated admin ratio perspective. We're going to stay the course on that staffing because being there for our customers is critically important in job one. On the long-term disability side, as I mentioned earlier, we are beginning to see both incidents and severity trend back downward in the business. You'll recall the previous two quarters both of those were up about 10% in Q3 and Q4. But on top of that, our claims teams are also experiencing very good claims resolutions. And what we're hearing from our claims managers is the combination of very low unemployment at 3.8% and wage inflation accelerating, there's a strong desire for claimants to get back to the productive workforce. So, in all, we're very pleased with the claims team's performance, and we're obviously happy to see the beginnings of an improvement in the environment. Operator : We reach end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Charlie for any further closing comments. Charlie Lowrey : All right. Thank you very much, and thank you all for joining us today. We continue to make significant progress on repositioning our business mix and advancing our cost savings program to transform Prudential into a higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble company. We're confident this strategy will help us deliver an even more meaningful difference in the lives of our customers and sustain value for our shareholders, while enabling us to fulfill our vision of becoming a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. Thanks again for your time today. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation.",

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Bob McLaughlin. Please go ahead, sir. Bob McLaughlin : Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today's call are Charlie Lowrey, Chairman and CEO; Rob Falzon, Vice Chairman; Andy Sullivan, Head of US Businesses; Scott Sleyster, Head of International Businesses; Ken Tanji, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by Charlie, Rob, and Ken, and then we will take your questions. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of such measures to the comparable GAAP measures and the discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, please see the slide titled Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures in the appendix to today's presentation and the quarterly financial supplement, both of which can be found on our website at investor.prudential.com. And now I'll turn it over to Charlie. Charlie Lowrey : Thank you, Bob, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our second quarter financial results reflect the impact of macroeconomic environments, including the unusual confluence and magnitude of rising interest rates, widening credit spreads, and equity market declines. In addition, we strengthened our individual life reserves as part of our annual review of assumptions, which had a significant impact on our results. This was primarily driven by an increase in our guaranteed universal life reserves. As a reminder, we discontinued single life guaranteed universal life sales in 2020 as part of our strategy to derisk our product mix and we continue to make strategic progress in transforming our businesses to be less market-sensitive and more nimble. We also made additional investments to enhance our long-term sustainable growth. We did this in several ways. First, we significantly reduced our market sensitivity by completing our planned divestitures. Second, we invested in growth businesses and partnerships to address customer needs and expand access to our products and solutions. And third, we continue to advance our cost savings program and now expect to reach our $75 0 million target one year ahead of schedule. We executed on these strategic initiatives with the support of our solid balance sheet. Our strong financial position provides us with the flexibility to navigate through the current macroeconomic conditions, while continuing to invest in the long-term growth of our businesses and return capital to shareholders. We're also confident that our higher rate environment will benefit our businesses over time despite the short-term impacts on our financial performance. I'll now provide an update on the progress of our strategic initiatives. Turning to slide three. We plans to reposition the businesses by reducing market sensitivity and making investments to support long-term sustainable growth. We completed the sales of our full service business and a portion of our traditional variable annuities in April. Together, these divestitures resulted in a $1.5 billion pre-tax gain and further reduce the overall market sensitivity of our businesses by approximately 20%. Moving to our growth investments. We are investing in programmatic acquisitions and partnerships that will help us grow in emerging markets and expand access to investing, insurance and retirement security around the world. In Africa, we completed our acquisition of an initial minority stake in Alex Forbes, a leading provider of financial advice, retirement, investment and wealth management in South Africa. We are now in the process of increasing our stake in the company by up to an additional 18% through a tender offer. In June, we established a partnership with Mercado Libre, the largest e-commerce platform in Latin America with approximately 200 million users. This will enable us to deliver life insurance and accident and health products, tailored to the platform's mass market customer base. At the same time, we are investing in the growth of our products that meet the evolving needs of our customers. Our FlexGuard buffered annuity product recently surpassed $10 billion in sales since launching two years ago. We are also experiencing strong sales from our more recently launched FlexGuard Income offering. Turning to our cost savings initiative on slide four. We now expect to achieve our full $750 million cost savings target in 2022, one year ahead of schedule. We recorded $175 million in cost savings during the second quarter for a total of $725 million of run rate savings to date since 2019. We've also implemented a process of continuous improvement to identify and execute on additional cost savings opportunities in the future. Turning now to slide five. Our robust balance sheet is at the core of all our efforts to transform Prudential to be a leader in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security around the world. This financial strength also provides the flexibility to balance investing in our businesses with delivering attractive returns to our shareholders. Our robust financial position includes a high-quality, well-diversified investment portfolio, our capital position supports a AA financial strength rating and we had $7 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the second quarter. During the second quarter, we returned over $800 million to shareholders. And since the beginning of 2021, we have returned a total of $6 billion towards our objective of $11 billion by the end of 2023. Finally, a comment on the environmental, social and governance front. In June, we published our third Annual Sustainability Report, which details the progress of our ESG initiatives, including information on our EEO-1 and pay equity disclosures, commitments to racial equity and achieving net-zero emissions. We believe in transparency and hold ourselves accountable to the commitments detailed in our report. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for an update on our business performance. Rob Falzon : Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, US and International Businesses. I'll begin on slide six with our financial results for the second quarter of 2022. Pre-tax adjusted operating income was $872 million or $1.74 per share on an after-tax basis and included a $1.4 billion increase in reserves from our annual assumption update and other refinements. We strengthened our Individual Life reserves, primarily reflecting updates to policyholder behavior and revised mortality assumptions. These updates were based on several industry studies; emerging practices and our own experience, following our well-established annual assumption update process. Current quarter results also included an $852 million gain from completing the sale of PALAC, a legacy block of Variable Annuities. Our GAAP net loss was $1.4 billion lower than our after-tax adjusted operating income, primarily driven by the mark-to-market impact from higher interest rates on derivatives that are used for asset liability management, partially offset by a gain on the full -- on the sale of our full service business. Turning to the operating results of our businesses, excluding the impacts of the annual assumption update and the gain on the sale of PALAC. PGIM, our global investment manager reported lower other related revenues driven by a decrease in seed and co-investment income and incentive fees, as well as lower asset management fees compared to the year ago quarter. Results of our US businesses were lower than the year ago quarter, reflecting lower spread income due to less favorable variable investment income and lower fee income resulting from the decline in equity markets, partially offset by more favorable underwriting. The decrease in earnings in our International Businesses primarily reflected lower earnings from joint venture investments, lower net investment results driven by less favorable variable investment income and less favorable underwriting results, partially offset by business growth. Turning to Slide 7. PGIM, our global active investment manager, has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, alternatives, real estate and equities. PGIM's long-term investment performance remains attractive with 75% to 85% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last three, five and ten-year periods. PGIM benefited from its diversified business mix, as strong institutional net inflows of $8.1 billion, primarily driven by fixed income, offset retail outflows as investors repositioned their portfolios in a rising rate environment. As the investment engine of Prudential, the success and growth of PGIM and of our US and international insurance and retirement businesses are mutually enhancing. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise and access to institutional and other sources of private capital are our competitive advantage, helping our businesses bring enhanced solutions, innovation and create more value for our customers. Our insurance and retirement businesses in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated flows and unique access to insurance liabilities that complement its successful third-party track record of growth. PGIM's average fee rate increased due to the successful execution of our strategy, including the continued mix shift toward higher fee strategies in our alternatives and private credit business. As a result, asset management fees decreased by only 6% despite assets under management declining by 11% due to rising rates, widening spreads and equity market depreciation. We continue to grow our alternatives in private credit business, which has assets under management of approximately $230 billion across private credit, real estate equity and debt and private equity secondaries and benefits from our global scale and market-leading positions. Notably, across PGIM's private platform, we deployed nearly $15 billion of capital, up nearly 40% from the year ago quarter, reflecting the continued strong environment for private credit. PGIM also raised nearly $3 billion in new private capital commitments across real estate and private credit. Turning to Slide 8. Our US businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income and benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to shift our business mix towards higher growth and less market-sensitive products and businesses to transform our capabilities and cost structure and to further expand our addressable markets.  Retirement Strategies achieved solid sales in the second quarter across its institutional and individual lines of business. Institutional stable value sales were $1.6 billion. International reinsurance closed $1.4 billion of longevity reinsurance transactions during the quarter, and US pension risk transfer closed several transactions totaling more than $725 million. Our product pivots in individual retirement have resulted in strong sales of more simplified solutions with nearly $1.5 billion of FlexGuard and FlexGuard Income sales in the second quarter. Our strong FlexGuard sales benefited from implementing a fully digital and automated new business experience. This tech-forward approach helps to maintain our record pace of sales. Our Individual Life sales also reflect our earlier product pivot strategy, with variable life products representing approximately 71% of sales for the quarter. The improved group insurance benefits ratio for the quarter reflects the transition from a pandemic to an endemic phase of COVID, as well as favorable experience in both group life and disability. In addition, we're focused on creating the next generation of financial solutions to serve the diverse needs of a broader range of customers and clients. This quarter, we launched the Prudential simplified issue final expense product on the Assurance platform. Turning to slide nine. Our International Businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multi-channel distribution model, as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in high-growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high-quality service and expanding our geographic coverage and product offerings. Our needs-based approach and mortality protection focus continue to provide important value to our customers, as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. And we continue to enhance customer experience and agent support, including through digital tools. For example, this quarter, Gibraltar launched an exclusive website dedicated to teachers to help serve this market. In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a carefully selected portfolio of businesses in regions where customer needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market-leading businesses and where the Prudential enterprise can add value. In the second quarter, we continued to focus on expanding product and business capabilities in emerging markets to meet the evolving needs of customers. In Brazil, we achieved record sales, driven by the expansion of our third-party distribution channel, where sales increased 120% compared to the year ago quarter, as well as by the continued strength of the Life Planner channel. We established a partnership with Mercado Libre in Latin America to expand access to customers in the region. In the first two weeks following the launch in June, we have sold Life and A&H policies in every state in Brazil. This was accomplished through a fully digital sales, customer service and claims experience. We also continue to expand our wellness platform across Latin America by establishing a partnership with Medif\u00e9, a health service provider to 300,000 customers in Argentina. In addition, we are expanding our presence in Africa through an investment in South African-based Alex Forbes, as Charlie discussed earlier. As we look ahead, we're well positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We continue to invest in growth businesses and markets, deliver industry-leading customer experiences and create the next generation of financial solutions to better serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken. Ken Tanji : Thanks, Rob. I'll begin on slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the third quarter of 2022 relative to our second quarter results. As noted, pre-tax adjusted operating income in the second quarter was $872 million and resulted in earnings per share of $1.74 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense for how our third quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items. First is an adjustment for two one-time items that net to a charge of $571 million in the second quarter. Our annual assumption update and other refinements resulted in a net charge of $1.4 billion, primarily driven by our Individual Life business, as Rob previously described. This was partially offset by a $852 million gain from the sale of a block of legacy variable annuities. Next, variable investment income outperformed expectations in the second quarter by $80 million. Third, we adjust underwriting experience by a net $25 million. This adjustment includes a placeholder for COVID-19 claims experience in the third quarter of $5 0 million for our International Businesses, primarily due to hospitalization benefits for policyholders recovering from COVID-19 at home in accordance with the special regulatory provision in Japan that is currently in effect. We have also updated our mortality assumptions for the US Businesses to include continued COVID-19 mortality with an expected gradual transition to an endemic phase over time. While we have attempted to reflect COVID-19-related claims experience, the actual impact will depend on a variety of factors such as infection and fatality rates, geographic and demographic mix, and the effectiveness of vaccines. And last, we expect other items to be $30 million lower in the third quarter, primarily due to lower than typical expenses in the second quarter that were partially offset by lower other related revenues in PGIM and lower joint venture earnings. These items combined get us to a baseline of $2.63 per share for the third quarter. I'll note that if you exclude items specific to the third quarter, earnings per share would be $2.75, a modest decline primarily due to lower fee income as a result of market depreciation, lower underwriting income due to the updated actuarial assumptions, and continued COVID-19 mortality that is now reflected in our US Businesses expected results. While we have provided these items to consider, please note there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the third quarter. Turning to slide 11. I will now comment on the upcoming adoption of the new accounting standard for long-duration insurance contracts, also known as LDTI, which goes into effect on January 1st, 2023. The new accounting standard applies to our GAAP financial statements and will have no direct effect on our statutory financial statements, cash flows or dividend capacity. We estimate that adjusted book value, which excludes accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, will be reduced by $1 billion to $2 billion as of December 31st, 2021. This reflects the reclassification of non-performance risk gains from retained earnings to AOCI and other changes in reserves. We believe adjusted book value, which excludes AOCI, remains a relevant measure as AOCI and GAAP equity will continue to lack symmetry in the valuation of invested assets and insurance liabilities. We estimate that AOCI will be reduced by approximately $28 billion to $33 billion as of December 31st, 2021, primarily due to the remeasurement of long-duration liabilities with a lower discount rates, primarily in our Japan business. Also of note, GAAP equity and adjusted book value will continue to exclude certain unrealized insurance margins from products subject to LDTI. As of December 31st, 2021, the estimated after-tax unrealized insurance margins related to those products are expected to be $60 billion to $65 billion, primarily in our Japan business. These margins represent an important factor in determining financial strength. Turning to Slide 12. We continue to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position continues to support a AA financial strength rating and we have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets were $7 billion and above our $3 billion to $5 billion liquidity target range, due to the receipt of proceeds from the sales of our full service retirement business and a block of legacy Variable Annuities and other sources of funds include free cash flow from our businesses as well as contingent capital facilities. Turning to Slide 13 and in summary, we are executing on our plans to reposition our businesses. We are expecting to reach our targeted cost savings one year ahead of plan and our rock-solid balance sheet provides financial flexibility to execute on our transformation and thoughtfully deploy capital. Now I'll turn it to your operator for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Your line is now live. Tom Gallagher : Good morning. I'd like to start on the mortality assumption review, the charge. Can you talk a little bit about what drove it? Was it more the mortality side? Was it more the lapse side? Was it mainly mortality assumptions pre-pandemic? Was there a meaningful adjustment from the experience that you've seen through the pandemic? A little bit of color there would be helpful? Thanks. Ken Tanji : Yes. Hey Tom, it's Ken. Let me give you a little bit of background on the assumption update. As I think most people know, each year in the second quarter, we examined our updated experience that's available from our own business, but we also look at information that's available from industry studies and other surveys.  And again, this year, we followed our process that's quite comprehensive and well established. We did make updates to our individual life insurance actuarial assumptions, primarily for policyholder persistency and mortality. Let me start with the policy persistency changes, that was mainly with our guaranteed Universal Life products, where we lowered our lapse and surrender assumptions and that revision reflected information, we gained from recently released studies and surveys, as well as our recent emerging experience. And so, we essentially refined into a more dynamic lapse assumptions for that portion of the business. In terms of mortality, we also included the impact of COVID-19 claims with the expectation of shifting from endemic to -- or from a pandemic to endemic phase. And we also lowered future mortality improvement, as well given recent trends. Now the majority of the reserve strengthening was the result of the policyholder persistency assumption. The mortality updates were more modest and across all of our businesses. Tom Gallagher : That's really helpful, Ken. Appreciate that color. My follow-up is just, will the -- will this also result in a statutory impact in addition to the GAAP impact? And if so, can you help quantify that and talk about how that could impact capital management, if at all? Ken Tanji : Yes. The updated assumptions are applied to our statutory reserves as well. It will have a comparable magnitude of impact but we're well positioned to maintain strong regulatory capital ratios. We have a strong capital position overall, and we continue to have diverse sources of free cash flow going forward as well. Operator : Your next question is coming from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Your line is now live. Ryan Krueger : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Would you expect much of an impact from updated Q2 factors for longevity risk, which I don't think was in the RBC ratio previously and an updated mortality risk factor when that is implemented, I believe, which may be at year-end? Ken Tanji : Yes. Ryan, it's Ken again. I'll take those. No, we don't expect a significant overall impact for either of those. The longevity factors were incorporated, I believe, last year and including some correlation benefits between longevity and mortality and given the updated -- the updates to mortality that have been proposed, those will be manageable and again, reflective of the good combination of business that we have that is both longevity-based and mortality-based. Ryan Krueger : Got it. Thanks. And then I had a question on the Bermuda subsidiary that you had established earlier this year and contributed capital to last year -- or last quarter. Can you give any more color on kind of what your longer-term plans are for that? And what -- to what extent you may be able to start shifting US Business into Bermuda to get an offsetting benefit from the capital you had contributed last quarter. Thanks. Ken Tanji : Okay. Yes, Ryan, yes. The -- we did launch a new company last quarter. It's a new reinsurance company that's based in Bermuda, which we call LOTUS Re. We think it's a really good capability to have. We've reinsured a block of variable life policies to that company. We're obviously following the BMA standards. The business is well reserved and capitalized, including the capital that we put in, in it last quarter. But it's also very well aligned with the economics of that business. So going forward, we do believe this will be a more efficient capital framework for our Variable Life business that's well aligned with the economics of that business as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler. Your line is now live. John Barnidge : Thank you very much. Can you maybe talk about persistency trends in group life and visibility? There's been increased lapse activity seen by other market participants, given kind of the movements in the war on talent among employees. It looks like persistency did go down in 2Q for disability, but not life. Thank you. Andy Sullivan : Hey, John, good morning, it's Andy. Ill take your question. Maybe I'll bring it up a level and say that the general effect that we saw during the pandemic was companies really pulled back on switching their benefit plans. As we've come through the pandemic and as hopefully we're coming out the other side, and it's becoming more endemic, we've seen, basically, in the marketplace, a normal level of RFP activity. So things have gotten sort of back to normal. When we talk about our persistency, we're very pleased with our persistency results. And as you would imagine, we track very closely the profitability of the business that we retain versus the profitability of the business that we lose. And part of the secret sauce of managing group insurance businesses is, sometimes addition by subtraction. If we can't get the rates that we want to get to move a case to profitability, we -- our plan and our intention and our follow-through is always to let it go. But we're quite pleased at the persistency levels in the business. John Barnidge : Great. Thank you very much. And then, my follow-up question, if I may. That unrealized insurance margin in Japan, is that a gain that can be harvested through a risk transfer, or how should we be thinking about Pru realizing those? Ken Tanji : Yes. Hey, John, it's Ken. Let me just -- the unrealized insurance margin is -- that we're referencing here and quantified is under the GAAP constructs. And you can think of it as basically the present value of future premiums less the amounts of the premiums needed to provide claims -- to provide for claims. So it's margin above and beyond what's needed to support the expected claims. It is indicative of the profitability of the business, and the majority is from our Japan business, and it's reflective of what we think is the strong profitability of our Japan business. It's -- there is good embedded profits there and value, and it is a potential source of free cash flow over time. And if we choose to reinsure a block of it as well, we could release capital that way. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Elyse Greenspan : Hi. Thanks. My first question, going back to Individual Life. When we normalize for the assumption review, VII and underwriting, it looks like the underlying earnings power of that segment is in the range of $100 million. And I think in the slides, you guys put the Q3 baseline at $96 million. So can you talk about if there are any ongoing earnings impact from the assumption review? And is roughly $100 million pre-tax a good quarterly level run rate earnings for that segment? Andy Sullivan : Yes, Elyse, this is Andy. I'll take your question. The assumption update does have an ongoing impact on our Individual Life business. It reduces our core earnings capability in the neighborhood of $30 million per quarter. So our core run rate was about $105 million before, so it brings it down to $75 million. What you're seeing in our walk on the slide, remember that we expect to have $20 million of higher underwriting gains seasonally in third quarter of 2022. So if you make that adjustment, that gets you to that 96 baseline. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thank you. And then my second question is on Assurance IQ, if you guys can just give us some color on the upcoming enrollment season. And then revenues declined there roughly 30% in the second quarter. Were revenues, for some reason, impacted by the assumption review, or should we just think about that $78 million perhaps indicating a lower baseline for that segment? Andy Sullivan : Yes, Elyse, it's Andy. I'll take the question. Let me start by reiterating that we're still very focused on scaling up revenue in each of the distinct product lines in the Assurance IQ platform, as that really is what's required to get the business to achieve profitability. With that said and you sort of pointed to this, there are a number of things that are important to discuss this quarter as we've made really good progress in Medicare Advantage that was somewhat masked. First, we did have a $17 million negative LTV adjustment, that is a direct impact on revenue, that was an adjustment -- assumption adjustment based on our persistency. Second, we saw an impact on the under 65 healthcare business versus the year ago quarter as the Biden administration did not open up a special enrollment period like they did last year. Those two factors really masked a 64% improvement in Medicare Advantage enrollments and a resulting 35% increase in Medicare Advantage Commission revenue versus a year ago quarter. So, we are pleased with the continued underlying fundamental strengthening in the Medicare Advantage product line. The first part of your question is, how we're feeling about our preparation. We're making very good progress in becoming ready for the fourth quarter open enrollment season from an agent preparedness perspective specifically. We've now -- we'll be entering our third year, so we have the benefit of two full cycles underneath us. And candidly, we're seeing great success in hiring agents, partly due to the difficult time that some of the smaller players in the space are having. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Jimmy Bhullar : Hi, good morning. I just had a question first on the actuarial review and its impact on future income. I think you mentioned $120 million on GAAP. Should we assume a commensurate impact on stat income going forward as well? Ken Tanji : It would have a similar impact on GAAP earnings. I'm not -- we'll have to get back to on the quantum of that, but there would be a future impact to strengthening going forward. Q \u2013 Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. And then can you talk about your \u2013 the decline in the Life Planner Count and Gibraltar Life Consultants and whether it's sort of -- and what your expectations are for growth in both of those agency channels? Is the decline being caused more by sort of COVID-related factors right now or should we assume modest growth going forward in both of those? Scott Sleyster : Hi Jimmy, this is Scott. The LP count has been essentially flat with new recruits roughly offsetting LP resignations and our LC count has actually been slightly negative. As you might expect, it's been more challenging to recruit in a pandemic environment. It's actually a little bit harder to mentor new hires in this kind of environment. We expect this situation to remain challenging until the pandemic eases. But we would then expect to see improvement in kind of a return to normal beyond the pandemic. I think it's also worth noting that we continue to focus a great deal of energy on expanding our third-party distribution channels across all of our markets. Operator : Thanks. The next question is coming from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Suneet Kamath : Thanks. Just wanted to come back to the assumption review and the impact on statutory. Just given the size of the charge, does this suggest that you're going to need to infuse capital into PICA or is there enough excess RBC in there to sort of absorb the similar charge that you took on a GAAP basis? Ken Tanji : Yeah, overall this will be very manageable, as I mentioned, where we think we're well positioned to maintain strong RBC statutory ratios. And right now, we're not expecting to have to infuse additional capital as a result. Suneet Kamath : Okay. Got it. And then I guess for, Charlie, I'll ask the same question I always ask on the strategy. And this idea of improving the earnings contribution from growth businesses to over 30%, it still seems like you'll need pretty sizable inorganic M&A to get there. So just curious, what you're seeing out there in the landscape? Are you seeing opportunities to put some of the $7 billion of liquid assets at the holding company to work? I mean, just thinking about inorganic growth, what are you seeing out there? Thanks. Charlie Lowrey : Yea, sure. We\u2019re seeing a number of different opportunities at this point in the cycle. You're beginning to see other things or some things free up that wouldn't have been there before and at reduced multiple. So it's a good time to have flexibility in order to be able to think about that kind of acquisition. What I would say is, I'll make a couple of observations. The first is our strong balance sheet provides us with the flexibility to manage through whatever macroeconomic conditions we may face as we look forward. And that's going to be an important consideration for us as we go forward. But second, to your point, having a strong balance sheet in a dislocated market means that we can take advantage of opportunities that present themselves. So we're going to be -- we do have a strong balance sheet. We're going to remain flexible with that balance sheet, and we're going to look for opportunities that may present themselves in the current economic environment. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Alex Scott : Hi. First question I had was on the Annuities business. Now that the transaction is closed, I was just wondering if you could help us think through earnings power there and just given a lot of moving parts to the transaction, equity markets. And then I think, maybe, the runoff of the block, how should we think of that over the next several quarters? Andy Sullivan : So, Alex -- Ken Tanji : Go ahead, Andy. All right. I was talking about that. Maybe I'll just comment. The -- we did close the PALAC transaction. And it was -- it came in as we were expecting and would reduce our earnings by about $75 million a quarter, and that is very consistent with what we had announced at the time of the transaction. Andy Sullivan : Yes, Ken, maybe I'll just jump in and add. I just may bring it up a level back to our intentional strategy to reduce our exposure to traditional variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits to be less than 10% of our enterprise earnings. And so that reduction is very intentional, and it was the two-step process of pivoting and runoff that remains on track. We saw $2.9 billion in runoff this quarter. And then, obviously, the derisking transaction. But the other major part of that was pivot to our FlexGuard chassis, a more simpler design, less volatile design. And we're certainly pleased with the continued strength of those sales. Alex Scott : Got it. And the second one I had for you was on the LDTI. You gave some good disclosure on the book value impact. And I know you mentioned that there's a lot of margin that's sort of left in the reserve, because of the pivot sort of approach to LDTI. What does that mean to the earnings power? Can you help us think through that, particularly in Japan, where it's a lot of 60, I assume that a lot of that margin probably has to do with that business. Will this materially change the earnings power? Ken Tanji : Yes. Overall -- and we'll be providing more disclosure around the whole transition to the new accounting standard as we -- around the time that it is implemented. But let me provide some overall thoughts on earnings. First, overall, we don't expect a significant impact on the level of core operating earnings. Certain businesses have little or no impact like PGIM and group insurance. And from our insurance and retirement businesses in the US and internationally, some will be a bit higher, some will be a bit lower. But overall, that's generally offsetting. So again, overall, we don't expect a significant change in the level of our core operating earnings. Operator : Thanks. Our next question today is from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Your line is now live. Tracy Benguigui : Good morning. I have another question on the assumption of that you mentioned industry study. We're in the cheap speed tier. Is that something that is widely available or if you could provide context regarding who participated in that study and who conducted the study, that would be very helpful. Ken Tanji : Yes. Tracy, that was done by a private party, and it did involve a number of people in the industry. We're not at liberty to disclose who was in there. That's proprietary information of the study. So that's about what I can tell you. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. Got it. Also noticed that your corporate expenses were low in the quarter compared to the baseline you provided last year. And I'm just wondering how you're thinking about the full year of $1.65 billion guidance. Ken Tanji : Yes. During the quarter, we did have some favorable items. We did have an FX gain that was helpful this quarter. We did have some other lower expenses and then there is some timing. And we do expect to have seasonally higher expenses in the second half of the year. But given where we are in the first half, we would expect to be modestly below the 1.650 billion guidance that we originally gave. Operator : Thanks. Our next question is coming from Jack Maton [ph] from Wolfe Research. Your line is now live. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask on the investment portfolio. Are there any metrics you can provide regarding new money rates relative to current portfolio yields? And then what percentage of the portfolio turns over on average in a given year? Rob Axel : Jack, it's Rob. I can provide that for you. In the -- if you compare the new money rates to our portfolio yields, they're up about 20 basis points in the US and 50 basis points in terms of a positive spread in Japan. So the rise in rates means we're no longer having a drag on our earnings when we measure our new money rates against that portfolio yield. In terms of rollover, it's somewhere between 5% and 10% on an annual basis. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you. And then just a question on the drivers and the outlook for net flows in the PGIM business. And clearly, this quarter, there was a strong recovery in institutional flows, but some pressure on retail flows. I guess could you just talk about what's driving some of the divergence across those customer types and maybe your outlook moving forward? Andy Sullivan : Yes, Jack, it's Andy. I'll take your question on flows. As we've talked about in the past, flows at PGIM will vary quarter-to-quarter. So we stay very focused on the long-term track record. In Q2, third-party net flows were roughly flat as very strong institutional inflows of $8.1 billion were offset by the retail outflows of $8.3 billion. Let me give you some color on that. So the $8.1 billion of institutional inflows represented our best quarter since 2018, and those flows were positive across every geography that we operate in. The real drivers where we continue to see clients, their algorithms, institutional clients algorithm shifting into fixed income as the rates rise, and we also see those clients continuing to seek yield in our private and alternative strategies. On the retail side, I would say the story is we were impacted like the rest of the industry by headwinds in the active fixed income and growth equity space. The industry experienced $305 billion in outflows across active US mutual funds as individual investors continue to reposition. Every top 10 fixed income manager and nine of the top 10 active growth equity managers posted negative flows. So, -- but despite that environment, our PGIM investments moved up to the number 16 US mutual fund family in the quarter by assets under management. I'll end the way I typically do, which is we're confident that we're going to be a net flow winner over time. As we look at our business, we have a broad and diversified product portfolio. We continue to put up very strong long-term investment performance, and we have great distribution. So, we'll continue to build on our track record of 18 of the last 19 years of positive flows, and we're quite proud of that. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Mike Ward from Citi. Your line is now live. Mike Ward : Thanks guys. Just wanted to follow up on Suneet's question about the transformation. And I think you touched on your strategy in terms of acquisitions. But to his point, it seems like that would require a very decent chunk of inorganic growth. So, I guess just wondering, should we assume from here that the strategy is primarily around organic growth acquisitions or opportunistic buys, or do you still look at material kind of divestments or reinsurance from your existing business mix? Charlie Lowrey : Yes. This is Charlie. Let me take that one. It's going to be a combination of both, right? Because in the -- as we've done in the past, we're going to continue to be thoughtful about the deployment of proceeds, especially in light of the macroeconomic conditions, and we've always said we're going to be good stewards of capital. But we're going to -- what we're going to do is to continue to demonstrate a discipline, a consistent and a balanced approach to the redeployment of capital within our businesses for acquisitions and to our shareholders, while fulfilling a commitment to our financial strength by maintaining a strong balance sheet. So, we're going to look at a combination of, again, investment in our businesses, acquisitions, returns to shareholders, but also divestitures if they make sense. And we've always said we'll look at additional divestitures of blocks of business, but only if they make sense. And that's what we're going to do as we go forward. So, it will be -- we'll get to our goals through both addition and potentially subtraction, but it has to make sense on both sides for shareholders. Mike Ward : Okay. Thanks very much. And so I guess, kind of relatedly, it sounds like a pretty comprehensive review in the Life business, just thinking about some of the difficulties that segment has faced over the last few years. I guess, does this have any impact on your strategic view of the Life business? It almost seems like at this point, even if you were to sell it or offload it at a loss, it might be beneficial, or is the diversification benefit, mortality longevity offset? Is that important to the extent that you're going to hang on to Life? Thanks. Charlie Lowrey : Yes. Let me start, and then Andy, you may want to add some commentary on it. But for the Life business, we still think there's a significant potential for growth in the industry. You have a $12 trillion insurance -- life insurance gap. You have increasing sales as shown by last year's industry, with sales being the best they have been in about two decades. And from an enterprise perspective, the Life business continues to be a really helpful component in balancing our longevity with our mortality. So there's a lot of interconnection with the other businesses along with PGIM, and it's a business that we would like to remain in, but we'll do so very, very carefully as we go forward. Andy? Andy Sullivan : Yes, Charlie, I would just add that we've had a very explicit strategy that we remain committed to, and the path forward is clear. We recognize the disappointing and volatile aspects of GUL. But remember that our strategy has been about pivoting and derisking the business. We see selling GUL -- single life GUL in third quarter of 2020 and we began to rotate the product portfolio towards simpler designs, inclusive of variable universal life final expense and simply term. We also have been very much leaned into reducing expenses to make the business more efficient. So as we're doing that, we're seeing the new business sales, where we have a lot of pricing power and we like the positive returns of that block of business that we're putting on, and we're filling that gap that Charlie talked about. Operator : Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lowrey for any further closing comments. Charlie Lowrey : Okay. Thank you very much, and thank you for joining us today. We've made significant progress reducing our market sensitivity, while investing in sustainable long-term growth, advancing our cost savings program and returning capital to shareholders. Looking ahead, we are confident that our strategy, along with our solid financial position will help us deliver an even more meaningful difference in the lives of our customers and delivering value to all our stakeholders, including providing attractive returns to our shareholders, while enabling us to fulfill our vision to become a global leader in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security. Thank you again for joining us and for your time today. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Bob McLaughlin. Please, go ahead. Bob McLaughlin : Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today's call are Charlie Lowrey, Chairman and CEO; Rob Falzon, Vice Chairman; Andy Sullivan, Head of US Businesses; Scott Sleyster, Head of International Businesses; Ken Tanji, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by Charlie, Rob, and Ken, and then we will take your questions. Today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions that we make today. In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of such measures to the comparable GAAP measures and the discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, please see the slide titled Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures in the appendix to today\u2019s presentation and the quarterly financial supplement, both of which can be found on our website at investor.prudential.com. And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Charlie. Charlie Lowrey : Thank you, Bob, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our third quarter financial results reflect the impact of market conditions, including the variability in alternative investment returns and lower fee income, as well as an elevated level of COVID-19 hospitalization claims in Japan, partially offset by underlying business growth, including the benefit from rising interest rates. We continue to transform our businesses to be less market-sensitive and better positioned to deliver sustainable long-term growth. This includes investing in products and solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers and achieving our $750 million cost savings target one year ahead of schedule. Our rock-solid balance sheet provides the financial strength to navigate the current macroeconomic environment and support our customers, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders. Turning to slide three. I'll start off today with an update on how we are investing in long-term growth opportunities that meet the evolving needs of our customers and support our vision to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. In September, Prudential was selected by IBM for a 50% participation in the second largest pension risk transfer transaction in US market history, with a total value of over $16 billion. This transaction builds upon our leadership role in this market, where we have helped employers safeguard their workers' retirements since pioneering the first jumbo PRT transaction a decade ago. We are well positioned to continue to benefit from the growing PRT market, which is expected to have over $50 billion of total industry transactions in 2022. In the individual retirement market, our FlexGuard suite continues to grow in both sales volume and product scope, with an additional $1 billion in sales, bringing the total to nearly $12 billion since its launch in 2020. Building upon FlexGuard's tremendous success, we plan to introduce FlexGuard Life, an index variable universal life product later this month. We expect our businesses will benefit from the increased demand for retirement decumulation products over the next decade, as we strengthen our role as a leader in the $300 billion annuities market. We're making similar growth investments on behalf of our international customers as well. During the third quarter, we expanded into Argentina, our partnership with Mercado Libre, Latin America's largest e-commerce platform with approximately 200 million users. Our expanded partnership follows our initial launch with Mercado Libre in Brazil earlier this year, which delivers life insurance and accident and health products tailored to the platform's mass market customer base. Moving to slide 4. As I noted earlier, we have now achieved $765 million of annual run rate cost savings, exceeding our target of $750 million and completed this one year ahead of schedule. This includes $180 million realized in the third quarter. To achieve these cost savings, we carefully assessed all aspects of our business and operations from our physical office space, to how we leverage technology to deliver more efficient customer experiences. For example, by embracing a hybrid work model, we reduced our office space footprint in the US by approximately 50%, which results in an annual run rate savings of about $50 million. On the customer experience front, our use of artificial intelligence accelerated our individual life underwriting from 22 days to 22 seconds. And our new digital claims processing capability can now deliver funds to most customers in six hours as opposed to six days. We also automated and reduced the timing of fund verification and processing on about one-third of new annuity sales from what was two to three weeks to now two to three days. And our group insurance claims processing is now three times faster, thanks to new data systems we have installed. Turning now to slide 5. Our rock-solid balance sheet and disciplined approach to capital deployment has helped Prudential navigate financial and macroeconomic challenges for nearly 150 years. Consistent with our AA financial strength rating, we have a strong capital position, a high-quality, well-diversified investment portfolio and approximately $5 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the third quarter. We continue to balance investing in our businesses for long-term growth, with shareholder distributions. In addition to the investments in our businesses that I previously mentioned, we also returned over $800 million to shareholders during the third quarter through dividends and share repurchases and for a total of $7 billion since the beginning of 2021. Looking ahead, we expect higher interest rates will economically benefit our business over time. We have the financial strength to continue to navigate the current economic and market environment. As we monitor developments, we will maintain our disciplined approach to capital management and redeployment, and our Board will review our 2023 capital plan early next year. Before turning it over to Rob, I'd like to touch upon the leadership transition we announced last week as part of our thoughtful approach to creating a sustainable long-term leadership structure. Beginning early next year, Andy Sullivan will move from his current role as Head of our US Businesses, including PGIM, to lead our international businesses and PGIM. Caroline Feeney who currently leads our US Insurance & Retirement Businesses, will take on an expanded role as Head of our Business Portfolio in the US and will join our executive leadership team. Scott Sleyster, who currently leads our international businesses, will retire in the first quarter of 2023. We thank Scott for his tremendous contributions to Prudential over the course of the 35-year career with the company. And look forward to working closely with Andy and Caroline in their new roles. I'll now turn it over to Rob for an update on our business performance. Rob Falzon : Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, US and international businesses. I'll begin on Slide 6 with our financial results for the third quarter of 2022. Pre-tax adjusted operating income was $1 billion or $2.13 per share on an after-tax basis and reflected lower variable investment income driven by market conditions and an elevated level of Japan COVID-19 hospitalization claims, partially offset by underlying business growth, including a benefit from rising interest rates. Our GAAP net loss per share was $0.78 on an after-tax basis, primarily reflecting realized investment losses, largely driven by higher interest rates. Turning to the operating results from our businesses compared to the year ago quarter. PGIM, our Global Investment Manager reported lower asset management fees, resulting from a reduction in assets under management reflecting higher interest rates, widening credit spreads and declines in equity markets. Results of our US businesses were lower than the year-ago quarter, reflecting lower spread income due to less favorable variable investment income and lower fee income resulting from the sale of a portion of the legacy variable annuities business, the decline in equity markets and net outflows, partially offset by more favorable underwriting as COVID-19 transitions to an endemic level in the US. The decrease in earnings in our international businesses reflected elevated COVID-19 hospitalization claims in Japan and lower spread income driven by less favorable variable investment income. Turning to Slide 7. PGIM, our global active investment manager, has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, alternatives, real estate and equities. PGIM's long-term investment performance remains attractive with more than 80% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last five and 10-year periods. PGM experienced retail outflows, primarily in fixed income, consistent with industry trends due to the rising rate environment, while institutional net flows continue to be positive. As the investment engine of Prudential, the success and growth of PGIM and of our US and international insurance and retirement businesses are mutually enhancing. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise and access to institutional and other sources of private capital or a competitive advantage. This helps our businesses bring enhanced solutions and create more value for our customers. Our insurance and retirement businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated flows and unique access to insurance liabilities that complement its track record of third-party growth. PGIM's annual fee rate increased due to the continued shift toward higher fee strategies, including our alternatives and private credit business. We continue to grow our alternatives in private credit business, which has assets under management of nearly $230 billion across private credit, real estate equity and debt and private equity secondaries and benefits from our global scale and market-leading positions. Across PGIM's private platform, we deployed $9.6 billion of capital this quarter. As we continue to invest in growth areas that are aligned with the needs of our clients, we also remain disciplined in finding opportunities to protect operating margins by managing the business more efficiently. Turning to Slide 8. Our US businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income and benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to shift our business mix towards higher growth and less market-sensitive products in markets, transform our capabilities and cost structure and further expand our addressable markets. Retirement Strategies achieved robust sales in the third quarter across its institutional and individual lines of business. Institutional Retirement closed nearly $10 billion of pension risk transfer transactions in the third quarter including being selected by IBM for a 50% participation in a $16 billion pension risk transfer transaction. Our focus on superior execution, supported by the experience of our high-quality PRT team and our continued market leadership in the US pension risk transfer market contributed to IBM selecting us. We continue to see a significant opportunity in the growing PRT market. In individual retirement, product pits have resulted solutions with $1 billion of FlexGuard and FlexGuard income sales in the third quarter, as well as increased fixed annuity sales. Our individual life sales also reflect our earlier product pivot strategy with variable life products representing approximately 70% of sales for the quarter. Group Insurance experienced a 50% increase in sales compared to the year ago quarter, reflecting higher national account life and disability sales and execution of our product growth strategy to drive supplemental health. Turning to Slide 9. Our international businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in high-growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high-quality service and expanding our geographic coverage and product offerings. Our needs-based approach and protection product focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. For example, we launched a yen-denominated investment product with a joint survivorship feature in the bank channel in the third quarter. In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a carefully selected portfolio of businesses and regions where customer needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market-leading businesses and where the Prudential enterprise can add value. In the third quarter, we continued to focus on expanding product and business capabilities to meet the evolving needs of customers. In Brazil, we expanded our digital sales application and achieved record sales for the second consecutive quarter driven by strong performance across all distribution channels. We further expanded our product offerings on the Mercado Libre platform in Brazil and successfully launched the sales platform in Argentina, as Charlie mentioned. In addition, we completed our tender offer for Alex Forbes, expanding our ownership to 33% of a leading provider of integrated retirement, investment and wealth management services in South Africa. As we look ahead, we're well positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We continue to invest in growth businesses and markets, deliver industry-leading customer experiences and create the next generation of financial solutions to better serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. And now with that, I'll hand it over to Ken. Ken Tanji : Thanks, Rob. I'll begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022 relative to our third quarter results. As noted, pretax adjusted operating income in the third quarter was $1 billion, and resulted in earnings per share of $2.13 on an after-tax basis.  To get a sense for how our fourth quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items : First, variable investment income was below expectations in the third quarter by $295 million; next, we adjust underwriting experience by a net $165 million. This adjustment includes a placeholder for COVID-19 claims experience in the fourth quarter of $20 million for our International Insurance businesses. We expect a lower level of hospitalization claims due to the recent government supported industry revision of eligible benefits policyholders recovering from COVID-19 at home in Japan; and last, we expect seasonal and other items to reduce adjusted operating income by $166 million, primarily driven by the seasonally elevated expenses expected in the fourth quarter. These items combined get us to a baseline of $2.71 per share for the fourth quarter. I'll note that if you exclude items specific to the fourth quarter, earnings per share would be $2.96. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power improved due to business growth, including the benefit of higher interest rates that more than offset equity market depreciation. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the fourth quarter. Turning to slide 11. Our capital position supports our AA financial strength rating. Our cash and liquid assets were $5 billion at the high end of our liquidity target range after investing in our businesses to support long-term growth, including the capital to support our IBM pension risk transfer transaction. We have substantial off-balance sheet resources, including contingent capital and liquidity facilities. Over the long-term, a higher interest rate environment is economically beneficial. In the near-term, the current market environment and the annual assumption update reduce our regulatory capital and excess liquidity. We will remain prudent in our capital deployment, balancing the preservation of financial strength, investment in our businesses for sustainable long-term growth and shareholder distributions. Turning to slide 12 and in summary. We are executing our plans to reposition our businesses, we achieved our targeted cost savings one year ahead of plan, and we are navigating the current macro environment with the financial strength of our rock solid balance sheet. Now I'll turn it over to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. Tom Gallagher : Good morning. The first question is just on the decline in the holding company cash balance dropped $2 billion sequentially despite the increase in net debt by $500 million. Ken, can you comment on whether there were any contributions to subs, I assume there were no dividends taking out, but a little bit of color for what happened there? Ken Tanji : Yeah. Hey Tom, sure. I'll cover that. We did make a capital contribution of $1 billion to PICA, our main US life insurance company. And that is to support a high volume of business growth, including the IBM and other pension risk transfer transactions that we did. We also made a $200 million of contributions to fund a few international joint venture investments that's part of our programmatic M&A into emerging markets. And then as we mentioned and highlighted that we funded shareholder distributions of $800 million. The $500 million of net debt increase that we had as we refinance our debt profile was essentially offset by holding company costs, including interest. We did not have dividends from our subs in this quarter, the timing of dividends from our subs to the holdco tend to vary and tend to be greater in the fourth quarter and first quarter. Putting that all together, we ended with highly liquid assets, $5.1 billion, still above our target range. So in some, the primary reason our holdco HLA declined or highlight liquid assets declined was due to the $1.2 billion of business growth. I also -- I just thought it would be helpful to remind people what I said on our last call is that we expect the statutory funding needs for our US Life Insurance business, including our assumption updates to be comparable to our GAPP -- the GAAP impact that we recorded in 2Q. The reserve strengthening will be higher, stat is more conservative, and that's going to be fully reflected in our stat results in the fourth quarter. As I also mentioned on our last call, we have excess capacity already in Pika available to meet that need. So the combination of the capital that we contributed to support business growth this quarter and the excess capacity we had in Pika within Pika will remain with RBC ratios consistent with our AA financial strength target. In terms of shareholder distributions, we will complete our shareholder distributions for this year in the fourth quarter with both dividends and share repurchases. And as Charlie mentioned in his remarks, our capital plan for 2023 will be approved by the Board early next year. And as always, they'll consider our capital position, opportunities to invest in our businesses and now increasingly so, the volatility uncertainty of the economy and markets looking ahead. So we'll factor that all in. But we'll continue with our philosophy of being thoughtful and disciplined with our capital and balance investment in our businesses with long-term growth and maintaining financial strength and returning capital to shareholders. Charlie Lowrey : Hey, Tom, it's Charlie. Let me just add one thing because I think part of your question is about can we execute on a long-term plan. And I'll just take it up a level and say we have additional levers we can pull and resources that we can use to do just that, to execute on our long-term plan. Tom Gallagher : Thanks a lot guys. It was very comprehensive. And Charlie, just -- so you'd still -- I think it was the $10 billion three-year total capital return plan. You still feel good about that given the levers that you have to work from? Charlie Lowrey : Yes. Ken, do you want to comment on that? Ken Tanji : Yes. Yes. Again, we're will complete -- we've already returned $7 billion through the third quarter. We'll complete our plans for this year. And again, our Board will factor in all the considerations that I mentioned into their decisions in early part of next year. Tom Gallagher : Okay. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Your line is now live. Tracy Benguigui : Thank you. First, congratulations to Scott, your retirement, Andy, Carolina in your new role. I'm wondering, given your progress to-date and thinking about market opportunities, do you feel like you need to elongate the three-year timetable of reallocating $5 billion to $10 billion of capital to higher growth less market-sensitive business. Charlie Lowrey : Sure, Tracy, it's Charlie. Let me take that one. So let me start by saying we remain totally focused on executing on our transformation strategy to become a less market-sensitive and higher-growth company. As you've seen, we've made a number of programmatic acquisitions in PGIM and emerging markets and in the second quarter, we completed two key divestitures that reduced our overall market sensitivity by 20%, so we're well on our way. Now, our path may not be linear as different growth opportunities present themselves at different times. And I would note that our diverse set of businesses provides opportunities to grow in different market environments as we've seen with this market environment, and we're well-positioned to benefit from this diversification. For instance, in the third quarter, our Retirement Strategies business did nearly $15 billion of sales, including a significant PRT transaction that demonstrate our leadership position in this market where we believe there's just tremendous growth potential going forward. But our business system is also self-reinforcing and as an example, the recent IBM PRT -- with the recent IBM PRT transaction, which is in the institutional retirement business. That also brought in over $8 billion in AUM to PGIM. So by saying we're focused on our high-growth businesses, naming PGIM and emerging markets, doesn't mean we're not looking to grow our other businesses as well. So, in summary, what I'd say is we're definitely committed to becoming a higher growth, less market-sensitive company. But our progress will depend upon a couple of things. One is the opportunities that arise, and the second is the macroeconomic conditions. Tracy Benguigui : That's very helpful. So, it sounds like you have organic growth opportunities. You're not only relying on programmatic acquisition. So, speaking of organic and you mentioned PRT. I'm just wondering if we should expect to see more coinsurance in the future for these large deals. And also if you could comment on funded status these days and what you've seen in the pipeline would that prohibit some deals getting done? Andy Sullivan : So, Tracy, it's Andy. And first, let me thanks for -- I appreciate the congratulations. You probably could tell we're exceptionally proud of our team and of our capabilities in our pension risk transfer business. The fact that we conducted the second largest transaction in history is second only to the ground breakage transaction we did with General Motors about a decade ago for $29 billion. This transaction, we did split 50-50 between us and another provider. And for clarity, the decision to split a deal is made by the plan sponsor versus carriers bidding together. As we look forward, we don't think deal splitting will be atypical and we will always be open to that type of situation depending on the deal's characteristics. Overall, the market in pension risk transfer remains very robust. The industry experienced a third successive record-breaking quarter. Third quarter came in at $28 billion, which was a 60% increase from last year. Funded status remains near record levels at 106%. So, we now expect this year, as you heard in Charlie's remarks to come in above $50 billion for the industry, and we believe that we'll consistently see about $40 billion going forward. Given the size of that market, despite that it's a competitive market, we expect, given our industry-leading track record and our capabilities, we're going to continue to find success at picking our spots. And net-net, this will be a nice organic growth area for us over time. Tracy Benguigui : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Your line is now live. Ryan Krueger : Hey thanks. Morning. I had a question on individual retirement earnings. I think on a core basis, they were up about $60 million, sequentially. Can you help us think through the key drivers of that? And if you'd expect that to be sustainable longer term? Andy Sullivan : Yes. So, Ryan, it's Andy again. Good morning. Thanks for your question on the Individual Retirement business. We're very pleased with the momentum that we're seeing this quarter. Let me speak first about our core earnings progress, and then I'll talk about our continued success at FlexGuard. We saw a material lift in our core earnings, thanks primarily to the change in the interest rate environment. And that's both on the short and long end of the curve. We get lift from interest rates on our collateral on the short end, and we're getting lift on the long-term side in our portfolio as well. And we're seeing the FlexGuard block grow. That's why you saw the step-up in our core earnings. And I would just kind of go back to what Ken said earlier, higher rates are a good thing overall for Prudential. Additionally, we're very pleased with the continued progress at building a very healthy FlexGuard block of business. Quarter in and quarter out, we remain a top share player in the market. We've achieved $11 billion in sales life to date. We very much like the profitability of the block that we've brought into the organization. And at the end of the day, kind of back to the organic growth discussion, we see the retirement decumulation opportunity in the country as a very good growth opportunity and we have all the right stuff to capture it. Ryan Krueger : Thanks. And then just wanted -- I had one quick capital follow-up. Charlie, you had mentioned that you have other levers that you can pull to execute on your long-term capital deployment plan. See if you could expand on that at all? And I guess, probably related to that, just you would contribute to capital earlier this year to Bermuda. At what point in time do you think you might see more business there to then release capital in the US? Thanks. Charlie Lowrey : Sure. Let me take the first part of that and then turn it over to Ken. I'll just give you a couple of quick examples. One would be sort of ongoing reinsurance transactions that we continue to review. And the other would be, we have levers both on and off balance sheet that we can pull. So we have lots of different levers and resources that we can use and regularly look at them in order to access additional capital. And Ken, do you want to talk about Bermuda? Ken Tanji : Yes, Ryan. Yes, the Bermuda sub that we launched earlier in the year is a good example of the levers that Charlie referenced. We have a new reinsurer in Bermuda. It's called Lotus Re. We did capitalize it with $800 million earlier this year, and we've reinsured a block of variable life business to it. So it will create capital efficiency, and it's a reinsurance capability that's sort of another tool in our toolbox going forward. Ryan Krueger : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Suneet Kamath : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to circle back on capital. You made comments about 2023 a couple of times. But just to level set, I mean, we're used to thinking about kind of the 65% free cash flow conversion as sort of the level of capital return that you guys would do on an annual basis, ex any specific special transactions. Should we be thinking about that as a baseline for next year, or are you signaling that the operating environment is a little bit more challenging. So maybe you'd guide to something a little bit lower than that. Ken Tanji : Yes. Hey, Suneet, yes, 65%, if you looked at our -- what we've generated in free cash flow from our businesses over time, that's been the average. It's been in some years higher than that and in some years, lower than that. Cash flow from our businesses this year is below our historical average. That's both as we continue to invest in our businesses for long-term growth, but also work through the statutory reserve increases in our life insurance businesses that we updated this year. So it will vary over time, but we think given our growth rates and our business profile, that's what our historical average has been. Suneet Kamath : Okay. Got it. And then just if I could come back to that $1 billion infusion into PICA, I mean, my rough math would suggest maybe half of that was related to the IBM PRT deal. So that leaves another $400 million, $500 million left. And I hear you on FlexGuard funding that growth, but individual retirement is still in outflows. And I would have thought the capital release from withdrawals would have sort of supported the new business. I guess I'm just trying to understand what the other piece of it is into PICA apart from the PRT transaction. Thanks. Ken Tanji : Yes. I don't know what rule of thumb you're using on specific business lines, but it was -- for us, it was primarily related to not just the IBM transaction but the other deals that we did as well. And the growth in our FlexGuard business. And we continue to see good profitability and cash flows from our existing VA business as well. Suneet Kamath : Was there any impact from interest rate hedges? You had a GAAP loss, but just wondering if there's any impact from that on the statutory results? Ken Tanji : Yes. There is, Suneet, is the rise in interest rates has been very swift. And over time, that will allow us to invest our insurance reserves at higher yields and improving profitability and cash flows. But in the near-term, our statutory surplus in the US business -- for our US business is reduced by what we consider a non-economic statutory reserve method that tends to manifest itself when rates rise, and we experienced unrealized and realized losses on our fixed income and derivatives. This is not unique to us. We believe it's an issue for the broader industry and it's uneconomic in nature and should be addressed. And there's a lot of discussions going on with regulators in the industry about this. So we'll manage the change in the rate environment, and we'll maintain regulatory capital is consistent with our AA financial strength objectives, but there is a short-term impact on our statutory capital. Suneet Kamath : Can you size that at all? Ken Tanji : It's still -- it's going to be subject to where the rates move. And so that's still dynamic. Suneet Kamath : Okay. Thanks, Ken. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler. Your line is now live. John Barnidge : Thank you very much. Seasonally 3Qs had typically been the best more talented quarter in any given year. This is a pre-pandemic world, of course. With COVID now clearly endemic, did that typical mortality seasonality return this year? Andy Sullivan : Hey, John, good morning, it's Andy. I'll talk about our COVID. We intentionally, as we've talked about many times in the past, manage our business mix to have a good balance between longevity and mortality. That absolutely paid us dividends all throughout the pandemic. During 3Q, the US experienced 42,000 deaths, which was 17,000 more than our estimate. But the fact is we continue to see a declining impact from COVID in the US. Let me just hit a little bit about each business. In Group Insurance, our life benefit ratio was 91.4%. It did reflect pre-pandemic mortality. That was slightly elevated due to accidental death and dismemberment claims that we very much see just as a natural quarter-to-quarter variability, nothing more. We're very pleased that we continue to see working age guests and its impact on working as continuing to decline. In Individual Life, we saw our mortality actual to expect it at the low end of our range, 97%. And we saw particularly good performance in the smaller face amount bands, and that is typically where we would see the COVID experience show up. In Institutional Retirement, we did see underwriting gains above our seasonalized expectations, particularly in pension risk transfer, but again, not surprising given the average age of that block of business. So the bottom line is, given the balanced mix of businesses that we have, we very much expect this will be very manageable as COVID continues to shift into an endemic state. John Barnidge : Great. And then my follow-up question. Institutional flows positive, but material deceleration in PGIM, retail improve in outflow. Can you maybe talk about how FX impact is changing where you're seeing demand, either a geographic perspective or from an asset perspective? Thank you. Andy Sullivan : Yeah, John, it's Andy. I'll take your question on flows. As we've always talked about, flows will vary quarter-to-quarter. So we stay very focused on our long-term track record. In Q3, we experienced third-party net outflows of $4 billion, driven on the retail side. Institutional net flows remained positive with strong positive flows into both Jennison equity and real estate debt. So showing the benefit of our diversified portfolio. We're very pleased with our positive $9 billion in institutional flows year-to-date. I would also note that, we experienced good affiliated flows. So from our insurance transactions, like the IBM transaction, we saw $7 billion in affiliated flows in Q3 and $14 billion year-to-date. That is a very important part of our strategy, and it reflects the synergies between our liability generation capability as well as our asset management capability. To your specific question about retail outflows were $4.6 billion that was a marked improvement from the $8.3 billion last quarter. Much like the rest of the industry, we continue to be impacted by headwinds in both active fixed income and growth equity. As far as where are the flows going, the flows are tending to go into passive, and in the short-duration strategies, we're obviously not a passive player. As far as FX impacts, we really haven't seen anything material to speak of. At the end of the day, we're highly confident that our diversified product portfolio has us well positioned that as the environment settles down and stabilize and flows start to shift back in, we have the experience to succeed and will be a net winner as we always have been. As we've talked about before, we've experienced 18 out of 19 years of positive inflows. John Barnidge : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Elyse Greenspan : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the Japan COVID losses. You had guided last quarter to maybe seeing about $50 million of unfavorable underwriting impact. And that came in at $200 million this quarter. So are you concerned that some of that leads into the fourth quarter? And do you think that there could be any movement around your reserves? Scott Sleyster : Thanks, Elyse. This is Scott. During the quarter, Japan experienced the largest surge of COVID cases since the beginning of the pandemic. Japan sort of did a really good job upfront, but Omicron hit them hard much later. The new infections were mainly concentrated in younger ages and they peaked in August, I think, at like over 240,000. They have since declined quite significantly. I think they're running around 40,000 today. So they're down to about one-sixth to where they were. From the beginning of the pandemic and consistent with regulatory guidance, A&H claims provided for a policyholder payments related to hospitalizations irrespective of whether the patient actually checked into the hospital. So with the large sets of COVID cases, we did, in fact, see a big spike in A&H claims, which is what you were seeing. Starting September 26, the industry in agreement or with support from the government determined that hospitalization benefits will no longer be paid if the insured individuals are not actually in the hospital with very few exceptions, things for people over 65 or pregnant women and certain serious comorbidities. So we expect the change here to be pretty dramatic in the fourth quarter. First of all, the infection levels are down a great deal and then the qualification levels have been substantially restricted. I think Ken already mentioned that we've got a placeholder for $20 million versus the $180 million for the fourth quarter. So we'll continue to closely monitor the situation. And as in the past, we remain focused on really taking care of our customers, but also looking out for our employees and maintaining the strength of our distribution channels. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks. And then my second question, what are you guys seeing in terms of the base spreads within institutional retirement? How quickly are those accelerating? And how should we think about the earnings growth potential in that segment from rising rates? Ken Tanji : Elyse, it's Ken. I'll start. And we have seen as the rise in rates and the rising yields have played out a better opportunity to invest at more attractive terms. And you see that leading to earnings improvement. But probably more importantly, will be the business growth, particularly with the with the pension risk transfer business that we just put on the books at the end of the third quarter. Andy Sullivan : Yeah. And Elyse, it's Andy. I would just add, we have a lot of momentum in our institutional retirement business. We have exceptional people, great capabilities, great brand and distribution systems, that's really second to none. And obviously, you've heard about that from a pension risk transfer perspective. But we had $13.5 billion in sales and institutional retirement. So it goes well beyond just pension risk transfer. We also had $1.5 billion in investment-only stable value and $1.2 billion in longevity reinsurance. So we have very good momentum, and it was a banner quarter for us in Institutional Retirement. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Your line is now live. Erik Bass : Hi. Thank you. Your outlook implies higher seasonal expenses of, I think, $115 million in the fourth quarter, which is less than the $125 million to $175 million range that you typically expect. Is this a function of just being disciplined on expenses given the environment, or should we think of this as a more permanent trend given the cost-saving actions that you've highlighted? Ken Tanji : Hey Erik, it's Ken. We are being more disciplined, but it's really timing. We see a lot of that coming into the fourth quarter as usual. And I wouldn't read too much into that. It's -- yes, we are being disciplined, but there's also timing considerations. Erik Bass : Got it. Thank you. And then can you talk about how the yen movements are affecting demand for US dollar-denominated products in Japan? Does this materially change the consumer value proposition and the outlook for demand or persistency? Scott Sleyster : Thanks, Erik. This is Scott. I'll go ahead and take that. There are several things that go on from the strength of the US dollar. On the one hand, you will have a cohort of customers who have bought kind of investment products, and they may want to terminate to take a gain if it's a net positive versus any surrender charge. And for people that have permanent life they may be thinking about reducing coverage because a certain dollar amount will provide more yen coverage, which is ultimately typically what they're looking for.  I think your question focused more on the sales side. With the dollar being this strong, we think people that will be looking for US dollar products will be sizing down their purchase again because in general, they are looking back to the coverage of the -- of ultimately how it covers them in yen. That being said, two other good things, I think, are going on with higher rates, US dollar investment products do look more attractive. And ultimately, overtime, while we have some short-term headwinds because we use swaps to hedge. In the long fall, this will add to our net investment income, which we view is a tailwind in that market. Erik Bass : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Wilma Burdis from Raymond James. Your line is now live. Wilma Burdis : Good morning. Could you clarify how the Lotus Re Bermuda entity works to create capital efficiencies? And is there a plan to bring in third-party capital in Bermuda? Ken Tanji : Yes. The Lotus Re is an internal reinsurance capability that's based in Bermuda. And we find that certain products in our initial use of it was with variable life that we find that the regime there, which is a very robust reserving standard is more principle-based and is better aligned with the economics of that business.  And as a result, by transferring that to reinsuring that to that regime, we get releases of reserves and capital in PICA. And again, it's our efforts to really align the economics of our businesses with reserve and capital standards that are robust and risk sensitive, recognize the nature of the business and are a better fit for that type of business. Rob Falzon : Wilma, it's Rob. Just sort of following on the second part of your question. So in that particular entity, no, our intent is not to bring in third-party capital. As Ken alluded to, it's a kind of a captive vehicle. Having said that, we are keenly aware of the increased institutional appetite coming into this sector. And as we've said before, we don't think that there's a firm who's better positioned to figure out how to satisfy the intersection of demand for our customers on the liability origination side with appetite for funding into those sorts of investments from the institutional side. So, nothing to talk about near term there, but we think we're particularly well positioned in order to be able to exploit that. Wilma Burdis : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Alex Scott : Hi, I had a follow-up on some of the questions on capital and the holdco cash balance. When I think about growth. I appreciate that there's the PRT. Ex maybe some heightened PRT growth, I would think PICA would be a bit more self-funding -- and I'm just trying to understand if maybe some of the need to fund growth from the holdco balance has to do with the expectation of what's going to happen in 4Q around the UL review. And the reason I ask is just if that is part of the contemplation that that's fine, and it's actually good because it means maybe you don't need to contribute any more in 4Q. And that's really what I'm trying to figure out is when you go through that review in 4Q, would this need to occur again? Like will there need to be more cash from the holdco that goes down into PICA to help fund that that impact? Ken Tanji : Yes. So Alex, the -- PICA is generating statutory capital with its business profile. But the size of the business growth that we experienced this quarter was pretty high and unique. And that's why -- we thought it was a very attractive use of capital and deployed capital for that purpose. We acknowledged that the assumption update would require funding needs, and that was a use of capital as well. But we had -- at the time of the second quarter, we had -- we're well-positioned to absorb that capital requirement within PICA, including the -- using the cash flow and statutory surplus that's being generated by our businesses. We'll be looking at the fourth quarter and evaluating again -- well, and I should mention, as I also described, we have had some short-term capital that is being held in reserves potentially for what we consider non-economic reserving given the rise in rates. And then we'll, again, as we always do in the fourth quarter, look at our capital position, our opportunities to deploy capital attractively and make sure we're maintaining PICA at our AA financial strength standards. Alex Scott : Got it, that's helpful. And then maybe a little bit of a more broad question on Japan. Could you talk about how a weaker yen impacts your business? And if that should be something we contemplate as we think about cash flow in 2023, either positive or negative? Scott Sleyster : Thanks Alex. This is Scott. We've been operating in Japan for a long time. And in my many years here, I've seen the yen as low as in the high 70s to as high as it is today. So, as that happens, customer preferences will shift, and so we'll see more yen sales, for example, if dollar products get priced too high. On the other hand, we may see more dollar deposit type products that will be more attractive in the bank or other parts of the Gib channel related to where the dollar is. So, I'd say fundamentally, we have the ability to adapt and we've demonstrated that we've done that over time. I guess, what I would come back to is, I would say, we're very disciplined in how we price our business in Japan. Part of the reason you've seen the bank channel down is we are \u2013 we've maintained our discipline around profitability. We haven't been chasing deposit products when the margins were really tight. So I feel very good about the franchise we have there. We see less price sensitivity in channels where we have a preferred position like Life Planners and some of the affinity groups. And we'll adapt the product mix based off of customer demand, but we're always going to keep our pricing discipline front and center. Ken Tanji : And Alex, I'll just add. We also have a very established hedging program with our Japanese business that hedges both earnings and the net equity position. And given the strength of the dollar that has a $1.8 billion gain at the end of the third quarter. Alex Scott : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Mike Ward from Citi. Your line is now live. Mike Ward : Thank you, guys. So you mentioned potentially reinsurance as one lever for a source of capital. Just wondering if that means we should sort of be expecting an annuities reinsurance deal, or could it be life or anywhere else? Any color there? Charlie Lowrey : Sure. Let me take that. This is Charlie. First, I'll deal with both annuities and then talk a little bit about life. We're really pleased with the valuation for the block of traditional variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits that we sold as evidenced by the gain on sale we reported. And we'll continue to explore possible additional opportunities to de-risk in-force blocks of traditional VA business. We expect to reach our goal of reducing market sensitivity through the pallet transaction we just completed and through the natural runoff of traditional variable annuities business over time and as we're not in a position of having to do another transaction. But having said this, we'll continue to explore possible additional opportunities, but we'll only do something, as we've said before, if it's in the best interest of stakeholders. So that's on the annuity side. On the Life block side, as we've noted in the past, we've dedicated resources to looking at various opportunities aligned with our strategy of becoming a higher growth and less market-sensitive company. And as a result, we'd certainly consider opportunities for a life sub-block if they came our way, but with the caveat that it has to make sense for shareholders. So we're going to be disciplined in our approach as the individual life business continues to be core to our purpose. Mike Ward : Great. Thank you. That's very helpful. And then maybe on PRT, just wondering if there's kind of a benchmark that maybe you could give in terms of how you think about earnings per $1 billion of PRT business or something like that. I guess one of your larger peers has given this in the past, I think it's around $7 million, $8 million of earnings per $1 billion of PRT, wondering if that sounds ballpark accurate? Ken Tanji : Yeah. Hey, Mike, this is Ken. All the deals are a little different. I don't think putting out a benchmark is \u2013 would be appropriate. Mike Ward : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is a follow-up from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Your line is now live. Tracy Benguigui : Thank you. I just wanted to revisit the statutory reserve charge you'll be taking in the fourth quarter. Just help me understand better why it would be comparable in size on the GAAP side? Because as you mentioned, statutory reserves are more conservative. I mean, I would imagine there'd be some cushion there, if you could elaborate on the compatibility. Ken Tanji : Yes. Tracy, it will be higher. But again -- and because generally because the stat is more conservative and it's also -- it's just different. But again, we have capacity to absorb that, and we still hold that view. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. When you say higher, you mean on absolute terms or the contribution will be higher, a little bit confused. Ken Tanji : No, I'm sorry. When we took the charge, we believe that we had and we continue to believe we have capacity to absorb that within PICA's excess capital position as a result. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. But I think last quarter, I think it was something like $1.4 billion pretax. So, are we talking the same dollar amount for stat? Ken Tanji : It would be higher again. We're still finalizing those. That will be finalized in our fourth quarter results. But again, we have the capacity to absorb that within PICA, and we'll continue to maintain RBC ratios consistent with our AA standards. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from Ryan Krueger. Your line is now live from KBW. Ryan Krueger : Thanks. I figured I just asked this since it wasn't asked last quarter. Would you be able to say what your ULSG stat reserve total is and what you moved to the ultimate lapse rate assumption to when you did the review last quarter. Ken Tanji : I think we need to follow up on both of those. They're pretty specific, if that's all right. Ryan Krueger : Yes, no problem. I just figured I'd give it a shot. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is a follow-up from Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. Tom Gallagher : Thanks. Just one question on the holding company cash, again, to come back to the -- the $5.1 billion, I believe, includes $1.5 billion that we should think about for prefunding a debt maturity in the middle part of 2023. I just wanted to confirm that, that's the intention. And should we think about the holding company cash really as $3.6 billion on a net basis? Thanks. Ken Tanji : Yes, Tom, in our holding company, cash position will vary depending upon the timing of when we issue debt or debt matures or we call it. We've consistently made it a good practice to prefund maturing and callable debt 12 to 18 months in advance. And this -- what this does is it reduces our refinancing risk and enables us to be selective in the timing of debt funding relative to particular market conditions. In August, we issued $1.5 billion of debt and we've earmarked that for debt that's callable next year. The timing was good. We're happy with the outcome. And we're going to continue to prefund debt as a good practice. And overall, though, if you looked at our level of debt over the last three years, it's been at a fairly consistent level. It will vary depending on timing of maturities and issuance. But overall, it hasn't changed that much. We also have, as we continue to highlight contingent sources of debt. So overall, we feel very good about the level of our debt that's consistent with our AA financial strength rating and how we manage refinancings of our debt very well as well. Charlie Lowrey : Hey, Tom, it's Charlie. I'd just reiterate what I said in the beginning as well. We believe we have other levers and resources by which to execute on our plan. So there are -- you can look at it in the one way you did. But on the other hand, as Ken said, and as we've reiterated throughout the call, we have other means by which to execute on our plan as well. End of Q&A: Operator : Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lowrey for any further closing comments. Charlie Lowrey : Okay. Thank you, operator, and thank you for joining us today. Before I conclude, I want to acknowledge the unexpected passing of George Paz last week, a member of Prudential's Board of Directors for the past six years. George was an integral member of our Board, with a unique perspective and deep business experience that helped us shape our thinking on a multitude of issues. He will be greatly missed and remembered as both a trusted adviser and as a friend. I hope we demonstrated during this call, the progress we're making to transform Prudential to deliver sustainable long-term growth and meet the evolving needs of our customers. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our strategy and the strength of our company. For nearly 150 years, Prudential has been there for its customers and other stakeholders, who we will continue to serve as we strive to be a global leader in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security. Thank you again for joining us today. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Bob McLaughlin. Please, go ahead. Bob McLaughlin : Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today\u2019s call are Charlie Lowrey, Chairman and CEO; Rob Falzon, Vice Chairman; Andy Sullivan, Head of International Businesses; PGIM [ph], our Global Investment Manager, Caroline Feeney, Head of US Businesses, Ken Tanji, Chief Financial Officer and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by Charlie, Rob, and Ken, and then we will take your questions. Today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions that we make today. In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of such measures to the comparable GAAP measures and the discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, please see the slide titled Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures in the appendix to today\u2019s presentation and the quarterly financial supplement, both of which can be found on our website at investor.prudential.com. And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Charlie. Charlie Lowrey : Thank you, Bob. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. As we look back on 2022. I am proud of the progress we've made executing against our strategic priorities. During the year. We continue to transform our business to be less market sensitive and better positioned to deliver sustainable long-term growth. We exceeded our $750 million cost savings target one year ahead of schedule, and our rock solid balance sheet provided the financial strength to navigate the evolving macro economic environment. I'll provide an update on each of these areas, beginning with our business transformation. Turning to slide three, during 2022 we reduced the overall market sensitivity of our business by completing the sales of the full service retirement business and the pay lock block as well as the run off of traditional variable annuities. We simultaneously continue to invest in the long-term sustainable growth of our business through programmatic acquisitions, and partnerships in emerging markets. In Africa, we acquired a minority interest in Alex Forbes, a leading provider of financial advice, retirement, investment, and wealth management in South Africa. We also continue to grow our third-party distribution network in Latin America, particularly in Brazil, where third-party distribution now accounts for about 50% of sales and complements our strong Life Planner channel. Additionally, we advanced our vision to be a global leader in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security. For example, we completed the second largest pension risk transfer transaction in US market history with IBM and close several major longevity risk transactions, including the $8 billion transaction we completed in the fourth quarter with the Barclays Bank, UK retirement fund. These transactions underscore our leadership in these markets, as well as the strength of our interconnected business model. Our IBM, PRT transaction provided PGIM with more than $8 billion in additional assets under management, and is a good example of how we leverage synergies across our businesses. We see a strong pipeline of opportunities in these markets in the year ahead. We continue to expand our product offerings to meet the increasing customer needs for financial solutions. For example, building on the success of our FlexGuard annuity products, we introduced during the fourth quarter FlexGuard Life, an indexed variable universal life product. In PGIM, we expanded our private loan capabilities through PGIM private capital, including our direct lending capabilities. This broad proprietary origination platform provides our insurance businesses and our institutional clients with unique investment opportunities and is another example of our self-reinforcing business model. We also invested in enhanced customer experiences that blend human touch with advanced technology. In Brazil for example, we expanded our digital sales application to expedite same-day policy delivery and processing with greater automation. In addition, as we administrator for the IBM PRT transaction, we introduced new technology capabilities to expedite the onboarding experience for 100,000 IBM pensioners. And as part of our continued efforts to refine customer experience, we implemented a company-wide initiative to better understand the evolving needs of all our customers around the globe. And in turn, deliver the most effective products and solutions to meet their needs. Moving to slide 4, we achieved $820 million of annual run rate cost savings, exceeding our target of $750 million one year ahead of schedule. We reach this milestone by streamlining and automating the way in which we operate, while improving the customer and employee experience. We leverage new systems and technologies to enhance our digital underwriting, claims and fund processing capabilities, improving efficiency, while reducing customer wait times. For example, for many of our Individual Life customers, we reduce the underwriting time from 22 days to 22 seconds. Our Group Insurance claims processing is now three times faster, and fund verification to process new annuity sales now takes two to three days, down from two to three weeks. We also implemented a hybrid work model for our employees that reduced our U.S. real estate footprint by 50%, equating to approximately $50 million in annual run rate savings. And finally, we adopted a continuous improvement mindset that helps us proactively identify and execute on cost savings opportunities that enhanced customer and employee experiences, and continue to improve our competitiveness going forward. Now to slide 5, our rock solid balance sheet and disciplined approach to capital deployment have helped Prudential navigate financial and macro economic challenges for nearly 150 years. And 2022 was no exception. Our financial strength, including our AA ratings is supported by $4.5 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the fourth quarter, as well as a high quality, well diversified investment portfolio. We continue to balance investments in the growth of our businesses with returning capital to our shareholders. During the fourth quarter, we returned more than $800 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, for a total of over $7.5 billion since the beginning of 2021. For 2023, our Board has authorized up to $1 billion in share repurchases, as well as a 4% dividend increase beginning in the first quarter. This represents our 15th consecutive annual dividend increase. Looking ahead, our strategic progress, financial strength and self-reinforcing business system, coupled with a higher interest rate environment position as well to be a leader in expanding access to investing, insurance, and retirement for our customers across the globe. Now, before turning it over to Rob, I'd like to extend a special Thank you to all our employees for their dedication to our customers and our communities. Together, we have made significant progress on our transformation, and are fulfilling our purpose of making lives better, by solving the financial challenges of our changing world. And now, over to Rob, to talk about the fourth quarter financial results, and to provide an update on our business performance. Rob Falzon : Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, US, and International Businesses. I'll begin on slide six. Pre-tax adjusted operating income was $4.7 billion or $9.46 per share for 2022 and $1.2 billion or $2.42 per share in the fourth quarter. These results reflect lower variable investment and fee income, partially offset by improved mortality as COVID has transitioned to an endemic phase, an increase in spread income due to rising interest rates, and underlying business growth. In addition, full year results include the strengthening of reserves from our annual assumption update and the gain on the sale of the PALAC Legacy variable annuity block. Our GAAP net loss for the quarter was $1.53 per share and included net realized investment losses and related charges and adjustments of $800 million, largely reflecting the impacts of rising interest rates. This loss also included a $700 million goodwill impairment due to the reduction in the estimated fair value of assurance. While assurance is making good progress in many areas and had a profitable fourth quarter, the impairment reflects lower growth expectations, higher discount rate applied to future applied to future cashflows reflecting macroeconomic conditions, and lower publicly traded peer evaluations. Turning to the operating results from our businesses compared to the year ago quarter. PGIM, our global investment manager reported fees, primarily due to lower assets under management, resulting from higher rates and equity market declines. Results of our US businesses primarily reflected less favorable variable investment income, partially offset by the impact of higher rates on spread income and more favorable underwriting. The decrease in earnings and our international businesses primarily reflected lower spread income, largely due to less favorable variable investment income and less favorable underwriting including elevated surrenders in Japan through the depreciation of the yen. Turning to slide seven, PGIM, our global investment manager has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, equities, and alternatives including real estate and private credit. PGIM's investment performance remains attractive with more than 79% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last three, five, and 10 year periods. For 2022, PGIM experienced positive institutional net flows that were more than offset by retail outflows, primarily in fixed income, consistent with industry trends due to the rising rate environment. In the fourth quarter, PGIM experienced third-party net outflows of $11.7 billion, driven by public fixed income strategies across institutional and retail clients. Institutional net outflows were driven by a few large client redemptions, while retail net outflows reflected the impact of the rising interest rate environment on retail flows across the industry. As the investment engine of Prudential, success and growth of PGIM and of our US and International Insurance and Retirement businesses are mutually reinforcing. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise and access to institutional and other sources of private capital are a competitive advantage, helping our businesses bring enhanced solutions and create more value for our customers. Our insurance and retirement businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated flows that totaled $13 billion during 2022 as well as unique access to insurance liabilities. In addition, we continue to grow our alternatives business, which has assets in excess of $230 billion across private credit and real estate equity and debt and benefits from our global scale and market leading positions. Notably, PGIM\u2019s private businesses deployed nearly $43 billion of gross capital in 2022. Turning to slide 8. Our US Businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investments spread and underwriting income and benefit from our complimentary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to shift towards higher growth and less market sensitive products and markets, enhance our customer experience while reducing costs by amplifying the use of capabilities and self-service tools and further expand our addressable markets. Retirement Strategies achieved robust sales in fourth quarter and full year 2022 across its institutional and individual lines of business. Our Institutional Retirement business has market leading capabilities with full year sales of almost $32 billion driving record account values at the end of the year. This includes being selected for a 50% participation in a $16 billion pension risk transfer transaction and our fourth largest international reinsurance transaction of $8 billion in the fourth quarter. In Individual Retirement, product pivots have resulted in continued strong sales of more simplified solutions like FlexGuard and FlexGuard income, representing over $12 billion of sales since inception, as well as increased fixed annuity sales. Our Individual Life sales were consistent through the year and reflect our earlier product pivot strategy, with variable life products representing approximately 70% of sales for the year. And our Group Insurance benefits ratio has improved during the year from lower COVID mortality. Turning to slide 9. Our International Businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multi-channel distribution model as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in high growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high quality service and expanding our geographic coverage and product offerings. Our needs-based approach and protection product focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a carefully selected portfolio of businesses and regions where customer's needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market leading businesses and where the Prudential enterprise can add value. Our International Businesses experienced their highest sales since the third quarter of 2020, including record sales in Brazil. Compared to the prior year quarter, Gibraltar sales were up 20% mainly driven by the life consultant channel primarily from higher US dollar sales. Life Planner sales were also up 17%, driven by continued momentum in Brazil's third-party distribution channel, as well as higher sales in Japan. As we look ahead, we're well-positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We continue to focus on investing in growth businesses in markets, delivering industry leading customer experiences, and creating the next generation of financial solutions to better serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. And with that, I'll now hand it over to Ken. Ken Tanji : Thanks, Rob. I\u2019ll begin on slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the first quarter of 2023 relative to our fourth quarter results. As noted, pre-tax adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter was $1.2 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.42 on an after tax basis. To get a sense of how our first quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items. First, variable investment income was below expectations in the fourth quarter by $125 million. Next, we adjust underwriting experience by net $60 million, as we normalize for fourth quarter experience and expect seasonality in the first quarter. And last, we expect other items to increase adjusted operating income by $91 million, primarily due to seasonally elevated expenses in the fourth quarter. These items combined get us to a baseline of $3.01 per share for the first quarter. I'll note that if you exclude items specific to the first quarter, earnings per share would be $3.07. The key takeaway is that, our underlying earnings power has improved due to the business growth and the benefit of higher interest rates. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the first quarter. As we as we look forward, we have included other considerations for 2023 in the appendix. Turning to slide 11. I'll now provide an update on the adoption of the new accounting standard for long duration insurance contracts which went into effect on January 1. The new standard applies to our GAAP financial statements and will have no direct effect on our statutory financial statements, cash flows or dividend capacity. We estimate that as of September 30, 2022, GAAP equity will increase by approximately $15 billion comprised of two components. Accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, will increase by approximately $17 billion, primarily due to remeasurement of long duration liabilities with higher discount rates in our Japan business. Retained earnings will be reduced by approximately $2 billion, reflecting the reclassification of non-performance risk gains from retained earnings AOCI and other changes in reserves. Also of note, GAAP equity will continue to exclude certain unrealized insurance margins from products subject to LDTI. As of September 30, 2022, the estimated after-tax unrealized insurance margins related to those products are approximately $50 billion, primarily in our Japan business. These margins are an important factor in determining financial strength and assessing profitability. And finally, we do not expect significant impacts from LDTI on our total underlying earnings power, as impacts across our businesses will largely offset. Turning to slide 12. Our capital position continues to support our AA financial strength rating. Our cash and liquid assets were $4.5 billion, at the high end of our liquidity target range. We have substantial off-balance sheet resources, including contingent capital and liquidity facilities. We remain thoughtful in our capital deployment, balancing the preservation of financial strength, investment in our businesses and shareholder distributions. Turning to slide 13 and in summary. We are transforming our businesses for sustainable growth. We exceeded our targeted cost savings one year ahead of plan and will maintain our discipline and continuous improvement mindset going forward. We continue to navigate the current macro environment with the financial strength of our rock solid balance sheet. Now, I'll turn it to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Your line is now live. Erik Bass : Hi. Thank you. Just hoping you could talk a bit more about how you're viewing excess capital. If we look at the pieces you provide, the pike RBC ratio is below the 400% level where it's run historically, I think the SMR ratio looks in line and Holdco liquidity is within your target range, but at the low end, if we adjust for the planned debt call that you talked about on the last call. So if this suggests a little excess capital, but are there other pieces or sources that we should be considering? Ken Tanji : Yeah. Hey, Erik, it's Ken. Overall, we do feel good about our overall capital picture in multiple parts, as you suggest, but I thought it might be helpful to give a little bit of an overall context for our capital management. We've had a very well-established and consistent approach. And we've served us very well particularly last year as we look to shift our business to be less market-sensitive and grow, while also maintaining financial strength and the flexibility. We closed the sales of our full service business and the PALAC variable annuity block last year that released capital at attractive terms. And we also deployed capital to the second largest PRT transaction with IBM. We also, as we mentioned and discussed on our last call, absorbed the capital impact of the assumption update in our life insurance business and the non-economic impact of higher rates on staffed capital. Again, that was expected. It's manageable, and we've appropriately addressed those capital implications. When you put that all together, we ended 2022 in a solid capital position. Our RBC ratios were above our AA objectives and our target there is to be above 3.75%. Our Japan solvency margin ratios are above their AA objectives. We have an HLA balance of $4.5 billion at the Holdco. And as you mentioned, that's at the high end of our target range. And we have a healthy outlook for our businesses with sustained profitability and free cash flow, so that led our Board to authorize $1 billion of share repurchases for next year \u2013 or this year, actually, 2023, and that's reflective of our capital position as we end 2022. That also considers the free cash flow outlook for our businesses and our opportunities to deploy capital and also the macro environment, whether that's a potential for another recession or other stress events. So again, when we put that all together, we feel good that we're consistent with our AA objectives. We have a level of flexibility, and that's what our board considered when they issued where they authorized $1 billion in share repurchases for this year and increased our dividend 4%, which, again, is the 15th straight year of dividend increases. So hopefully, I gave you a much broader answer there, but I hope that's helpful context. Erik Bass : Yes. Thank you. And then my second question was just hoping you could provide a bit more color on the company's sensitivity to short-term interest rates, which it seems like has been a big uplift, particularly in the individual retirement business. Hoping to get a little bit of the sensitivity there. And then just wondering if it were to reverse and the Fed were to cut interest rates would then you see kind of the earnings pattern for individual retirement move back lower? Ken Tanji : Hey, Erik, I'll start and then turn it over to Caroline to give a broader business context. But just from a sheer sensitivity to short-term rates, yes, we are benefiting from short-term rates. And generally, overall, our variable annuity business is sensitive to rates, both long-term and short-term. So a rise in both is actually helping us. In terms of short-term rates, we did see a pickup in earnings, because we're earning a higher return from collateral, that's posted on our hedging positions, and that's driven by the uptick in short-term rates. But there's more dynamics going on broadly for the business. So maybe Caroline, I'll turn it over to you for that. Caroline Feeney : Yes, of course, Ken. So Erik, first, I should point out that the individual annuities market had a record year last year with over $300 billion of sales and our own individual retirement strategies business delivered strong sales and earnings, and our sales success continues to be driven by our FlexGuard suite of index variable annuities where we now have over $12 billion in sales clearly reinforcing our leadership position as a top five player in this market. We also saw, Erik, some strong growth in our fixed indexed and fixed annuity solutions with fourth quarter results twice that of what we saw in the third quarter. Actually, in fact, more than 25% of our sales for the quarter came from these products. So ultimately, we're pleased with the progress we've made in this space. And we like the diversification these products bring to our overall business mix and the role they can play as a strong complement to our FlexGuard suite of solutions. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. Tom Gallagher : Good morning. Ken, should we think about that reduction being a planned use of the $4.5 billion of Holdco cash in 2023. I think you have a callable instrument in the middle part of the year of $1.5 billion. Should we assume your planning on calling that, or you still expect -- should we expect that to remain outstanding? Ken Tanji : Yes. Generally are -- and again, I think I mentioned this on the last call, our overall level of debt has been pretty consistent over the last few years. And we do have the ability to call about $1.5 billion of debt this year in June. But that's up to us. We're not obligated to do so. It is our practice to pre-fund upcoming maturities and calls and we've factored that into our debt issuance plans last year. Having said that, we're going to continue to evaluate the market conditions in our liquidity position and factor that into the decision to -- and the timing to call the debt or not. And we're also going to look at our overall funding needs going forward. And again, our discipline is to pre-fund upcoming plan. So it's really an ongoing cycle is the best way you should think of it. Tom Gallagher : Okay. Thanks. And then can you -- just for my follow-up, can you talk about how big of a GUL charge you took at -- for the -- at PICA for year-end? And any other, we'll call it, adjustments that we consider that occurred on a statutory basis at year-end between I assume there might have been AAT reserve releases or any other ins and outs that you can provide on the statutory impacts? Thanks. Ken Tanji : Sure, Tom. We -- as we described, when we updated our assumptions for GAAP, we would be making those same assumption updates for stat and that -- for statutory purposes occurs in the fourth quarter. So that was -- our GAAP impact was about $1.4 billion. It is larger on a stat basis. Stat tends to be more conservative, and that's what occurred in the fourth quarter. That was generally what led to the -- our RBC ratio in the fourth quarter going from above 400% to below it, but still, again, above our AA objective of 375. And we didn't make a capital contribution into PICA to achieve that again as we expected. So, just a reminder of the moving parts there. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Suneet Kamath : Thanks. I guess for Ken. Just curious, have you used Lotus Re yet and if and when you use it, should we expect sort of the freed resources to be somewhere in that neighborhood of the $800 million capital contribution that you originally made? Ken Tanji : Yes, thanks for bringing that up. We do have a company in Bermuda called Lotus Re, which is a reinsurer. And it does give us the capability to reinsure business to that entity, and we did so in 2022. As you mentioned, we initially capitalized it and then we reinsured a block of variable life business to that business -- to that entity in 2022, and that was a source of capital release. And all that was factored into our PICA outcomes for the year, which, again, we continue to be above 375. Suneet Kamath : And can you size that capital release? Ken Tanji : I don't think we want to put a precise number on it. It's an internal reinsurance transaction, but it does improve our flexibility. Suneet Kamath : Got it. And then I guess my follow-up for Charlie. I guess, overnight, we saw some headlines that came out about -- I don't know if they were quoting you are referring to some comments that you made about Prudential's M&A strategy and perhaps a change post I'm assuming the goodwill write-downs for Assurance IQ. So, I just wanted to give you a chance to comment on that and kind of how you're thinking about M&A, especially as you think about that strategy around improving the earnings contribution from growth businesses that you talked about, I guess, two years ago? Charlie Lowrey : Sure, Suneet. Thanks for the question and our ability to clarify. Yes, we saw the headlines too and we're slightly surprised. The -- our strategy remains consistent with exactly what we have been doing. So, what we've said is that we won't be investing in early-stage companies with less proven track records. What we're focusing on is developing a portfolio programmatic acquisitions, concentrating on more established businesses where we can expand the capabilities and scale of our existing businesses. And this approach supports what you said, which is our strategy of growing PGIM and emerging markets and really focusing on asset management and high-growth international markets that will help increase our fee earnings and growth profile. And if you look at our recent -- most recent four transactions, which include ICEA LION, Montana Capital Partners, Custom Harvest Asset Management, and most recently, Alexforbes, these are all examples of this approach of acquiring more established companies and are consistent with what we have done and what we will do going forward. Suneet Kamath : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Alex Scott : Hi. First one I had is on just sort of sources of cash flow as we think about 2023. You've talked about $1 billion of share repurchases, potentially some debt reduction. Could you talk about how that will be funded between PGIM cash flows, PICA in the US businesses versus Japan. And specifically, I'm interested in particular in PICA, if you plan to take dividends out this year? Ken Tanji : Yes. Alex, it's Ken. Our businesses are generating free cash flow to maintain our shareholder distributions, but -- and also to support the growth of the business. And we do have diverse sources of cash flow to the parent company. That's provided by our business mix across our US insurance and retirement PGIM and Japan businesses. And they're all expected to contribute over time, I think the way to think about our free cash flow ratio is it's been about 65% given our -- of our after-tax AOI, given our mix of business and growth. And we think that's about right. And we would expect, again, to receive capital from all of our businesses, including the PICA legal entity. Alex Scott : Got it. Second question I had is on Japan. Sales have picked up recently and looked pretty good. I guess, the premium growth is still a bit weaker on year-over-year comps and so forth. So I was just interested in what you expect from that, what kind of top line growth can we expect from that business? Andy Sullivan : So Alex, it's Andy. I'll take your question. Yes, you sort of mentioned some of the effects as we look back from the COVID pandemic that obviously resulted in some headwinds from a sales perspective. But thankfully, as we sit here, those pandemic challenges have subsided quite a bit. We're exceptionally proud of our Japanese businesses. We've steadily increased our market share over time, and we've consistently ranked in the top three for new business face amounts every year of the last decade, that's generated significant earnings and cash flows for Prudential. Our strategy to grow the business is threefold. First, we're very focused on continuing to strengthen and expand both our captive and our third-party distribution; Second, we're going to continue to innovate and expand on the solutions that we deliver to our customers; and finally, and importantly, we remain laser-focused on delivering an outstanding customer experience with a particular emphasis on our digital capabilities. We're very, very proud and good at that. In fact, we're consistently ranked by J.D. Power's in the top three and often number one in policy issuance, policy service and claims. The market remains highly attractive to us, and we intend to grow our position in the low-single digits over time. Alex Scott : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Your line is now live. Ryan Krueger : Hey, good morning. I had a follow-up on Japan. Have you seen any change in policyholder behavior in terms that may be driven by the weaker and volatile yen that we've seen over the last year regarding the FX products? Thanks. Andy Sullivan : Yes, Ryan, it's Andy again. I'll take the question. So given the rise in the US dollar and the weakening of the yen, we have seen an elevated level of surrenders in the business. The effect there is really some customers are looking to monetize their gains out of their non-yen products in yen terms. That being said, we saw this effect begin to decelerate in the month of December, and that deceleration has continued here in the month of January as the yen appreciate it. So we would expect as the yen starts to stabilize, this effect will stabilize in the business. Ryan Krueger : Got it. And then on the FC well charge, is there a chance that some of that could reverse from AAT subtest from higher interest rates when you do the look back in 2023? Ken Tanji : Ryan, it's Ken. I think you're referring to our asset adequacy testing. We're not expecting any significant change in our AAT reserves in light of the higher rate environment. Ryan Krueger : Okay. Got it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Your line is now live. Tracy Benguigui : Thank you. A follow-up on your statutory reserve charge for your assumption update. Last quarter, Ken, you mentioned it would be absorbed within PICA's excess capital position. Has that changed in the quarter where the ultimate size ended up being higher than your expectations and also on like GAAP reserve charges, I understand that funding for a statutory reserve charge does not have to come in all at once in 4Q. So can you share if you booked a portion of it before 4Q? Ken Tanji : Hey, Tracy, no, in terms of the assumption update, that is recorded in \u2013 that was recorded in the fourth quarter, again, consistent with established practice for statutory reporting. And nothing new there to report came in as expected, and we did not \u2013 we did not need to fund PICA with capital from Holdco as \u2013 also as expected. So, nothing really new there. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. And your latest buyback authorization levels suggest you're not meeting your objective over three years of $11 billion of capital returns. So I'm just \u2013 if you could walk us through what has changed since you set that objective. Was it just the reserve charge, or is it something else like PRT? I guess, my broader question is from this experience, are you rethinking the idea of coming up with a multiyear plan versus a singular year plan? Ken Tanji : Yeah. Tracy, it's Ken. Just looking back here and as a reminder, we set that a three-year objective in 2021 and the target was initially $10 billion over the three-year period. Later in 2021, we increased that objective as cash flow for 2021 was very strong. And as I kind of highlighted earlier in the call, in 2022, last year, we managed through a number of significant items, which was our assumption update in our life insurance business, the jumping rates and the non-economic impact on stat accounting and then we had the major PRT transactions. And again, when we put that all together, we think we end up to \u2013 at the end of 2022 in a very competitive position from a capital standpoint and a healthy outlook for our businesses with sustained cash flow going forward. So yeah, that's what got factored into the decision along with the outlook of the economy with the recession uncertainty. So the $1 billion will put us a little shy of the $11 billion, but it will only take about another quarter to achieve that. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Jimmy Bhullar : Thanks. First, just could you talk about your sales pipeline in PGIM in both the retail and the institutional side and how that's looking? Andy Sullivan : Sure, Jimmy, it's Andy. We have a high degree of confidence in our approach in PGIM. As you've heard me say before, flows are an outcome of really three things; having a broad and diversified product portfolio, great long-term investment results and great distribution. The bottom line is we've stayed very focused on those elements because we know they work. It has resulted in our strong track record over -- with positive flows in 18 of the last 20 years. So we're continuing to expand our product range in vehicles. Just as an example, our ultra-short bond ETF ranked number two in terms of net flow rate in its category. Second, we're continuing to invest in distribution on both the retail and institutional side. In retail, we're maintaining our high activity, high visibility approach with advisers. And in institutional, we added a significant number of new clients this year. And then obviously, finally, our long-term investment track record speaks for itself over three, five and 10 years. The predominant impact that we've seen has been a fixed income impact. And in particular, we believe that sustained higher rates are really good for the fixed income business. So we're going to keep doing what we know works, and we're confident that we're going to be a net grower over time. Jimmy Bhullar : Do you have enough visibility to assume that you'll have positive flows on an overall basis at PGIM for 2023 or too early to say? Andy Sullivan : So as I've said in the past, flow is very a good bit quarter-to-quarter, especially on the institutional side, they're chunky. So we wouldn't provide a forecast on that. Over the long run, we know that we're going to grow. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler. Your line is now live. John Barnidge : Thank you very much. My question is around agents. As I look at the agent count, they've declined overall in international. Is there anything being done to drive greater agent recruitment, or with productivity improved? Are you taking assurance lessons on the tax side to the agent force more generally? Andy Sullivan : So John, it's Andy. I'll take your question. So really, the impact you saw near-term, COVID kept pressure on our recruiting efforts and retention efforts. Fact is, throughout the last couple of years, it was a harder environment to recruit and establish culture with new agents. That impacted our life consultant count more so than our Life Planner counts, but it did affect both. As we've started to transition to more of an endemic, we are seeing an improvement and expect to see an improvement over time. We'll remain focused on two areas; first, strengthening our existing people's performance and we're exceptionally proud of our talent. We have the highest number of million dollar roundtable members who really deliver every single day for our customers. And second, we are continuing to lean in to attract land and develop new agents, which as we come out of the COVID pandemic, we believe will be easier for us. So this is a model that has worked for us very consistently over a long period of time, and we expect to keep seeing steady performance. John Barnidge : Thank you for that. And then my follow-up question. Can you talk about the decline in group new annualized premium in both Group Life and Group Disability? Is this from renewals, selective exits or job cuts at the large and jumbo into the market? Thank you. Caroline Feeney : Sure. John, it's Caroline. So I'll take your question. So first of all, just let me say, we're very pleased with the momentum that we've seen in our Group Insurance business. And as you're aware, the fourth quarter does tend to be a little lighter in terms of sales quarter, with the first quarter being our largest, as the majority of our cases do have January 1 inception dates. So the lower sales that you're noticing on a year-over-year basis is largely due to just a large case buyout last year that drove up sales volumes. And these do occur periodically and certainly can produce some variability in sales volumes, particularly in those lighter sales quarters. So John, if you were to normalize for last year's one-time buyout that we saw sales are actually up about 7%. And obviously, this is on the disability side. On the life side, it was just a matter of timing of premiums driven by changes in when some customers do enrollment in the year. So I would just say, overall, we feel very good as well about our existing pipeline as we continue with our strong sales momentum. John Barnidge : Thank you for the answers. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Elyse Greenspan : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question, can you talk about the impact that you've seen on your RBC ratio from the IMR getting forward at zero. And do you think that, that issue is solvable via either NAIC changes or by getting a permitted practice from New Jersey? Ken Tanji : Yes. Hey, Elyse, the impact on our PICA RBC ratio was about 35 basis points, maybe a little bit more. And that occurred with the rise in rates from 2Q through 4Q. And you'll be able to see that in our Blue Book and Green Book combined. So we'll be reporting that at the end of the month. We have been with very active discussions with regulators, and I know many others have across the industry have been as well. There seems to be a good understanding of the issue and a lot of careful consideration being given on how to best address it, so more to come. But rest assured, we're working with our regulators and many others are as well to see what -- how best to address this issue. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks. And then, Rob, I think you had mentioned that the Board was looking at capital deployment in the context of a recession and severe credit cycle potential. Can you talk about what kind of credit outlook factored into the Board's decision on the 2023 buyback plan? And what is your budget for downgrades and impairments if we enter into a recession? Rob Axel : Thanks, Elyse. We -- as Ken articulated earlier, the decision with regard to the buybacks factored in a number of considerations, including in that the possibility of recession and obviously, a recession that might be accompanied by a credit cycle, which could affect the portfolio. A couple of thoughts on that. First, while we do scenarios, which would anticipate the potential for both negative migration and credit losses, we also take some comfort, as our Board did from the strength that we have in portfolio management. We think we're incredibly well positioned in the event of any deterioration in the economy that might lead to a credit cycle. We're not yet seeing any of that, I'll note Elyse. If you look at our net credit migration in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2022, it was actually positive. So, we haven't seen any imminent signs of distress sort of percolating within the portfolio that would lead us to be overly concerned about that. But as we established the buyback amount that was authorized, we did anticipate that such a thing could occur and that we would want to be able to both anticipate that level of buyback and have the strength to be able to absorb anything that might happen from a negative migration or default standpoint. Ken Tanji : Maybe I'll just add just to remind people, we do have contingent sources of funding, in particular, our PCAPs, which is $3 billion is a guaranteed source of funding. So, that's an important source of funding in the event of a variety of reasons, including stress. Elyse Greenspan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. Andrew Kligerman : Hey good morning. I know there's been a number of capital questions and the IMR was impacted this quarter due to derivative losses given rising interest rates, now we've got rates coming off a bit in 1Q 2023. So, I'm wondering if you could give us a little sensitivity on rates and how we can think about that impact on capital, particularly with regard to these derivatives? Ken Tanji : Yes. Again, rising rates is generally a good thing economically. But for this one item called IMR, a decline in rates would help. But it's a pretty complicated and complex item and will also vary depending upon the activity level. So, I can't give you a precise sensitivity as a result. But we factored into our overall capital position in order to make sure we can deal with the volatility. Andrew Kligerman : Okay. Okay. And maybe help us on the expenses. So, you've got this terrific $820 million run rate savings. But as I look at results, I'm unable to kind of find those benefits falling to the bottom-line. So, maybe like a little color geographically, is all of it hitting the bottom-line? Like just a little color as to how we could think about that $820 million going forward? Ken Tanji : Yes. It has been a company-wide objective. So, the impact is across all of our businesses and the contribution that our corporate centers make towards that. And it does hit the bottom-line. Having said that, we are investing to grow certain business lines, particularly PGIM and International and so they just want to add that dynamic in there as well. Andrew Kligerman : Got it. And just a real quick technical question. Are you planning to deploy capital into Assurance IQ going forward, or will it -- now that its generating a little profit, can it be self-funding? Ken Tanji : Yes, we've maintained Assurance well-capitalized and funded its losses as they've been incurred. Profitability continues to improve and we'll continue to keep it well-capitalized going forward. Andrew Kligerman : Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Michael Ward from Citi. Your line is now live. Michael Ward : Thanks guys. Good morning. Just a high level question, I was wondering if the capital pressures, reserve charge, maybe earnings pressure in certain lines over the last 12 months or so. I'm wondering if that has changed specifically how you think about your business mix at all. And I know you've taken a few solid steps so far, but it seems like some incremental divestment or derisking could help reduce some of these pressures going forward. So I'm just wondering how you think about that prospect? Charlie Lowrey : Sure, Mike. It's Charlie. I'll take that. So as you know, we've made significant progress in our transformation so far, but we would also note, we still have more work to do to become a higher growth and less market sensitive company. And as we look ahead, we're going to focus on our financial performance. We're going to focus on advancing our transformation, including the customer and employee experience, and we're going to focus on continuing to thoughtfully deploy capital. All of that, with a goal of creating long-term sustainable value for all our stakeholders. And we think we're well-positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investment -- investing insurance and retirement security. And we'll do that in three ways. We'll continue to invest in our growth businesses and markets as we go forward, we'll deliver industry leading customer experiencing, leveraging our broad capabilities and scope of diversified businesses, and which we'll continue to invest as well, and we'll create the next generation of financial solutions to better serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. So what I'd say in summary is that we're definitely committed to becoming a higher growth, less market sensitive company. And our progress will obviously be dependent upon opportunities that arise and the macroeconomic conditions we face, but we're laser focused on what we need to do, and we'll accomplish that. Michael Ward : Okay, great. Thank you. And most of my questions were asked, but I was curious, just sort of nail in the coffin, making sure you're not liable for the earn-out with Assurance IQ? Ken Tanji : Yeah, I'll cover that. Actually, one of the things that we disclosed for GAAP is the fair value of that earn-out, and we've been disclosing that as zero. So I think that would give you a good indication. Michael Ward : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is a follow-up from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Suneet Kamath : Great. Thanks for the follow-up. Maybe just two quick ones. Just for Ken, I was curious about your comment about no change to AAT reserves even with the move up in rates. Can you just talk about why that would be the case? Ken Tanji : Yeah, because AAT, I mean it looks at a number of scenarios and it also looks at not just the level of ending surplus but also interim periods. And with derivatives, we have some interim periods that offset the impact of higher rates on the ultimate period. So it's a little technical question. But overall, little changes there. Suneet Kamath : Got it. And then just curious on LDTI. I know you said that the AO impacts offset across businesses. But can you just give us a sense of maybe, which businesses benefits, and which businesses saw some pressure? Ken Tanji : Yeah. Sure. So yeah, again, overall, we don't expect an overall change to the run rate level of the earnings. And actually, some of the businesses will have no or little impact, which would be, as you would expect, PGIM, Assurance and Group Insurance. The earnings from our International and Institutional Retirement businesses, are expected to increase on a run rate basis, and that's really due to the earlier recognition of the unrealized insurance margins, which are quite sizable. On the other hand, earnings from individual retirement and life insurance in the US are expected to be lower, and that's primarily due to the slower recognition of revenue for those businesses. Again, kind of some pluses and minuses that offset but that's sort of the segment level information. We, like others, will be providing a lot more information prior to our first quarter earnings when we restate under the new standard. So, you can expect to get a lot more. Suneet Kamath : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lowrey for any further or closing comments. Charlie Lowrey : Okay, thank you. And thank you everyone for joining us today. I hope we demonstrated the progress we are making to transform Prudential to deliver sustainable, long-term growth and meet the evolving needs of our customers. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our strategy and the strength of our company. For nearly 150 years, Prudential is focused on creating value for our customers and other stakeholders who we will continue to serve as we strive to be the global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. Thank you again for your time today. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Charlie. Charlie Lowrey : Thank you, Bob. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. During the first quarter, we continued to transform our business to be less market-sensitive and better positioned to deliver sustainable long-term growth. Our financial strength, disciplined asset liability management and robust risk management position us well to navigate the current macroeconomic environment while maintaining our balanced approach to capital deployment focused on creating value for our stakeholders. Turning to Slide 3. I'll begin this morning with an update on the progress of our strategy to become a higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble company. We are investing in long-term sustainable growth by expanding access to our products and services and markets around the world, including through programmatic M&A and organic growth opportunities, creating the next generation of financial solutions and delivering industry-leading customer experiences. Let me provide a few recent examples. Yesterday, we announced that Prudential is acquiring a majority stake in Deerpath Capital Management, a leading US private credit and direct lending manager with more than $5 billion in assets under management. The acquisition will expand PGIM's alternative capabilities, while providing additional fee-based revenue and complementing PGIM's existing direct lending origination capabilities. In addition, Deerpath is a great example of we are building our self-reinforcing business model, which will benefit both third-party investors as well as our insurance and retirement customers. Our Institutional Retirement Strategies business had strong first quarter sales, largely driven by our Pension Risk Transfer business, which had its best first quarter ever with more than $2.8 billion in total new business transactions. In addition, we experienced continued momentum in international reinsurance with a $500 million longevity risk transaction. We also achieved new growth milestones in our international business, especially in Latin America, where Prudential of Brazil's sales reached double-digit year-over-year growth through our three distribution channels. In particular, we are driving growth in Brazil through our expanded third-party distribution channel, which allows more consumers to access our products and services. During the quarter, we also expanded our distribution through the Mercado Libre platform into Mexico to sell life and accident and health products. In the US, our individual retirement strategies business continued to expand its suite of next-generation protection solutions. We expanded our FlexGuard distribution and introduced new product enhancements to meet the evolving needs of our customers. We are also diversifying our sales mix to meet increasing customer needs in a higher interest rate environment. Sales of fixed annuities represented one-third of total individual annuity sales in the first quarter, a significant increase from a year ago quarter. We continue to enhance the ways in which customers engage with our products and solutions, to drive more digital experiences and better customer outcomes. Let me give you a couple of examples. First, an industry survey ranked Prudential as a top three carrier in e-signature adoption. A majority of annuities applications are now submitted with e-signature, which has reduced processing time by several days and improved our environmental impact. Second, we launched a new electronic claims portal for life insurance customers that allows beneficiaries to file claims in minutes and to receive payments in days rather than weeks. By using the portal this quarter, we have experienced a 300% increase in digital claims processing and overwhelmingly positive customer feedback. Turning now to slide four. Prudential's rock solid balance sheet and robust risk and capital management frameworks have allowed us to confidently navigate the current macroeconomic environment. Our financial strength, including our AA rating is supported by $4.6 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the first quarter, as well as a high-quality, well-diversified investment portfolio and a disciplined approach to asset liability management. We've also taken advantage of opportunities to further optimize our financial flexibility and liquidity position. We proactively issued a contingent capital facility to replace the one that matures in November of this year and issued $500 million of hybrid debt to pre-fund the maturity of the same amount next year. Moving to slide five. Our disciplined approach to capital deployment also enables us to effectively balance investing in the long-term growth of our businesses with returning capital to shareholders. In the first quarter, we returned $700 million to shareholders and increased the quarterly dividend by 4%, our 15th consecutive annual dividend increase. Looking ahead, we will maintain our disciplined approach to capital management and redeployment. We are confident that this approach, coupled with our robust financial position, mix of mutually enhancing businesses and growth strategy, positions us well to be a leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security for people around the world. Thank you for your time this morning. And with that, Rob will now provide an overview of our first quarter financial results and an update on our business performance. Rob Falzon : Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, US and International businesses. I will also provide an overview of our investment portfolio and specifically our commercial real estate holdings, given the increased focus on the risks associated with a potential near-term credit cycle. I'll begin on slide six with our financial results for the first quarter of 2023. Our pre-tax adjusted operating income was $1.3 billion or $2.66 per share on an after-tax basis. These results reflect underlying business growth, including the benefits from a higher interest rate environment, offset by lower variable investment and fee income, as well as elevated seasonal mortality experience. While elevated mortality improved compared to the year ago quarter as COVID has transitioned to an endemic phase. Turning to the operating results from our businesses compared to the year ago quarter. PGIM, our global investment manager, had lower asset management fees due to lower assets under management resulting from the higher interest rates, equity market declines, and net outflows. Other related revenues increased primarily from seed and co-investment earnings. Results of our US businesses, primarily reflected lower fee income, less favorable variable investment income, partially offset by the impact of higher rates on spread income and more favorable underwriting. The decrease in earnings in our International businesses primarily reflected lower spread income largely due to less favorable variable investment income. Turning to slide seven, PGIM, our global active investment manager, has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, equities, and alternatives. PGIM's investment performance remains attractive with 80% or more of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last three, five and 10-year periods. PGIM experienced third-party institutional and retail net outflows of $14 billion in the quarter, primarily from fixed income strategies. Institutional outflows were mainly driven by client redemptions for liquidity needs, including de-risking actions of defined benefit sponsors. Retail outflows were driven by investors rebalancing amidst higher interest rates and inflation, consistent with the industry. As the investment engine of Prudential, the success and growth of PGIM and of our US and international insurance and Retirement businesses are mutually self-reinforcing. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise, and access to institutional and other sources of private capital or a competitive advantage, helping our businesses bring enhanced solutions and create more value for our customers. Our insurance and retirement businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated net flows, which totaled $2 billion in the first quarter of 2023 as well as unique access to insurance liabilities. In addition, we continue to grow our private alternatives and credit business, which has assets of approximately $235 billion across private, corporate and infrastructure credit, real estate equity and debt, and secondary private equity and will be further enhanced through the acquisition of Deerpath Capital, as Charlie previously stated. Turning to slide eight, our US businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income and benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to shift towards higher growth and less market-sensitive products and markets, enhance our customer and adviser experiences, and further expand our addressable market. Retirement strategies achieved strong sales of $5.5 billion in the first quarter across its institutional and individual lines of business. Our Institutional Retirement business has market-leading capabilities with first quarter sales of $3.8 billion, including a jumbo pension risk transfer transaction, which contributed to record account values at the end of the first quarter. In Individual Retirement, product pivots have resulted in continued strong sales of more simplified solutions like FlexGuard and FlexGuard Income, representing over $13 billion of sales since inception, as well as increased fixed annuity sales that comprised approximately one-third of our sales. Our individual life sales reflect our earlier product pivot strategy with variable life products representing about 70% of sales for the quarter. And we continue to diversify group insurance sales with strong growth in supplemental health and disability products and driving 25% growth in the premier segment from the prior year quarter. Turning to slide nine. Our international businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multi-channel distribution model, as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in high-growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high-quality service and expanding our geographic coverage and product offerings. Our needs-based approach and protection product focus continue to provide important value to our customers, as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. We continue to enhance customer experience and agent support, including through digital tools. Prudential of Japan ranked number one in two out of the three categories in the 2023 J.D. Power Life Insurance customer satisfaction survey. We are proud to be recognized for the value we provide customers. In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a carefully selected portfolio of businesses in regions where customer needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market-leading businesses and where the Prudential enterprise can add value. Our International businesses experienced their highest sales since the third quarter of 2020. Compared to the prior year quarter, Gibraltar sales were up 16%, mainly driven by the Life Consultant channel, primarily from higher US dollar sales. Life Planner sales were up 13%, driven by the continued momentum in Brazil as well as higher sales in Japan. Now turning to our investment portfolio on slide 10. We have a disciplined approach to our investment portfolio construction and management. It reflects our robust asset liability management practices, commitment to broad diversification and a rigorous underwriting security selection and credit management framework. We also leverage PGIM's expertise across multiple asset classes, including its deep and long-standing experience in private placements and real estate. With respect to our investment portfolio, here are a few key points. 30% of the portfolio is invested in government securities, primarily comprised of US treasuries and Japanese government bonds. 43% of the portfolio is invested in corporate securities, of which over 93% are investment grade. Private placements represent almost 40% of these corporate securities and over half of our BBB and below rated securities. These privates have financial covenants and structural protections that have consistently resulted in lower losses than comparable public securities. In past cycles, the loss experienced on our BBB private placements have been comparable to single A public credits. Mortgage loans represent an area of interest; I'll provide more detail on slide 11. Our mortgage loans represent 13% of our portfolio and reflect our conservative underwriting with an average loan-to-value of 57% and debt service coverage of 2.4 times. The portfolio is broadly diversified by property type, overweight in more defensive sectors such as multifamily and industrial, and underweighted in both office and retail. Specifically, office properties represent only 2% of invested assets, with loan to values and debt service coverage ratios that are in line with the overall portfolio. We have a disciplined portfolio monitoring process to review all investments at least annually and a robust risk management framework, which includes stress tests under cyclical and tail scenarios. Any potential credit losses in these scenarios are factored into our capital management framework and are expected to be manageable. As we look ahead, we are well positioned across our businesses to be a leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We continue to be focused on investing in growth businesses and markets, delivering industry-leading customer experiences and creating the next generation of financial solutions to better serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. And with that, I'll now hand it over to Ken. Ken Tanji : Thanks, Rob. I'll begin on Slide 12, which provides insight into earnings for the second quarter of 2023 relative to our first quarter results. As noted, pre-tax adjusted operating income in the first quarter was $1.3 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.66 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense of how our second quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items. First, variable investment income was below expectations in the first quarter by $150 million. Next, we adjust underwriting experience by $85 million to normalize for first quarter experience. And last, we expect other items to increase adjusted operating income by $25 million, primarily due to the seasonally elevated expenses in the first quarter. These items combined get us to a baseline of $3.20 per share for the second quarter. I'll note that if you exclude items specific to the second quarter, earnings per share would be $3.29. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power has improved due to business growth, including the benefit of higher interest rates. While we have provided these items to consider, please note there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the second quarter. Turning to Slide 13. Our capital position continues to support our AA financial strength rating. Our cash and liquid assets were $4.6 billion at the high end of our liquidity target range. We have substantial off-balance sheet resources including contingent capital and liquidity facilities. As Charlie noted, we replaced a $1.5 billion contingent capital facility that will mature in November. We remain thoughtful in our capital deployment, balancing the preservation of financial strength and flexibility, investment in our businesses and shareholder distributions. Turning to Slide 14 and in summary, we are transforming our businesses for sustainable growth. We continue to navigate the current macro environment with the financial strength of our rock-solid balance sheet, and we maintain a balanced and disciplined approach to capital deployment. Now I'll turn it to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting your question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. Tom Gallagher : Good morning. First question is just on the potential for the rules being changed on the interest maintenance reserve. Can you -- I know that I think that was around the $1.8 billion negative adjustment for you guys last year based on the mark-to-market impacts from interest rates from derivatives. Curious if -- I think there's a proposal within the NAIC out there that suggests there will be some changes. Can you talk about whether you think that will go through and whether or not at least some portion, if not all, of the $1.8 billion could be recaptured if it has changed? Thanks. Ken Tanji : Hi, Tom, it's Ken. Yes, the NAIC is in the process of addressing what is uneconomic issues with the IMR. They -- as you mentioned, they've released a proposal, and that's out for comment until June 9th. So, they're giving some time to receive input for the industry to work collectively on this. We think it's a big step in the right direction as both the industry, the ACOI regulators that -- they're focused on addressing this issue. Having said that, the proposal needs some changes in a few areas, but there is a process to sort that out. We and many others are engaged in very constructive discussions. It's hard to predict the regulatory process, but it seems it's on the path for changes this year. Tom Gallagher : And Ken, would you -- is kind of your base case assumption based on what's out there now that you'll potentially get all of it back, or would it be just a part, maybe a partial clawing back of some of that negative impact on RBC? Kenn Tanji : Yes, Tom, again, it's hard to predict. There are things that are being discussed and until that those things get sorted out, I wouldn't want to give an indication of how that plays out. But again, they are taking input, it's a very constructive process, I think all the intentions are there to put this on the path for resolution, but that will play out in time. Tom Gallagher : And then just for my follow-up, I just -- a question on leverage. I think you've announced you're going to redeem $1.5 billion of sub debt in June. And I think you issued $500 million this quarter as well -- or sorry, in Q1. The -- where do you stand now on leverage? Can you just talk about -- do you have upward capacity to issue more debt? Are you at about the right level? Because I think there's been some changes in -- certainly, from an accounting perspective, it's a bit of an elusive calculation to do from our perspective. But can you provide some help there? Thank you. Kenn Tanji : Yes. Sure. Yes, at the end of first quarter, we were in line with our leverage objectives and then when we call the $1.5 billion of debt, which has always been in our plans to do that in June, that would increase our debt capacity. Our overall debt capacity, though, is a function of rating agency criteria and other objectives, as we look at profitability, free cash flow, fixed cost coverage and stress testing, which we believe is important. So, it's not just leverage that would determine our debt capacity. But again, calling that debt was part of our plans. It was prefunded and that will improve our debt capacity going forward. And overall, we're on track for our plans for the year. Tom Gallagher : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Your line is now live. Ryan Krueger : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Could you talk a little bit more about the drivers of PGIM flows in the quarter? And then I guess how are you thinking about the outlook going forward? Do you -- would you anticipate further liquidity-driven repositioning impacts, or do you think a lot of that's behind you now? Andy Sullivan : Good morning Ryan, it's Andy. I'll take your question. As we always discuss, flows are going to vary quarter-to-quarter. So, we stay focused on the long-term track record. In Q1, we experienced third-party net outflows of $14 billion, driven both by retail and the institutional. On both fronts, as you heard Rob say upfront, it is very much a fixed income story. Our retail outflows were $3.8 billion in the quarter. The fact is we continue to see money flowing out of active US mutual funds and into money market funds, CDs and other short-term solutions. That being said, we did see a slowing of the retail outflows in the quarter consistent with the industry. We would expect this outflow trend to reverse once inflation moderates and the rate environment stabilizes. On the institutional side, net outflows were $10.2 billion for the quarter. That was driven almost entirely by redemptions from public fixed income as institutional investors sought that liquidity, as you mentioned, and DB sponsors de-risk their plans. We would expect that the near-term, flow volatility in the institutional business will remain volatile, given the heightened macroeconomic, geopolitical and market uncertainty. That being said, our long-term investment performance remains very, very strong with over 80% of our benchmarkable assets outperforming the three, five and 10-year marks. We have high confidence in the power of our platform, particularly as sustained higher rates are going to be good for the fixed income business, and we will benefit over time from the synergy between our insurance and asset management businesses. So by paying attention to the fundamentals, we know we'll be a net grower. Ryan Krueger : Thanks. And then, a follow-up on other related revenues in PGIM. What -- how sensitive is that to transaction-related real estate fees? And I guess, in other words, in the current environment where there's less commercial real estate activity, would you expect that to remain a little bit lower than normal because of the lack of incentive fees, or can you give some perspective on that? Andy Sullivan : Yes. Again, it's Andy. Thanks, Ryan. As you know, last quarter, we lowered our run rate expectations for ORR, specifically due to as you're speaking to the expected slowdown in real estate-related revenues. And that shows up in a variety of ways, obviously, both in the agency side, but also as you're talking about in transaction fees and incentive fees. So in the quarter, we came in lower than our expected average, because we saw that real estate slowdown as we expect it. And I guess, the only other thing I would mention is, just a reminder that incentive fees tend to be seasonally low in Q1. So that was definitely a contributor as well. So I think over time, the expected average of about $50 million is still the right ballpark, but definitely, the real estate slowdown will have an impact. Ryan Krueger : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Your line is now live. Erik Bass : Hi. Thank you. You mentioned stress testing your credit portfolio and including that in your capital management plans. So I was just hoping you could provide a bit more color on what you're assuming and what those capital impacts could look like in a moderate or severe recession scenario. Rob Falzon : Erik, it's Rob. I'll take the first stab at sort of describing how we think about stress testing. And then, Ken, perhaps I'll turn it over to you and you can talk about how we factor that into our capital planning. So we perform -- we have a very robust enterprise risk management capability and perform a whole series of stress tests that vary between our outlook on a base case basis, which includes sort of a moderate decline from an economic standpoint, a full board recession and particularly with respect to our real estate portfolio, we look at -- we run some of the CCARs more severe stress tests that the banks are subject to as well. The results of those are factored into both our capital planning and our reserving. We haven't, Erik, updated any disclosure on that. But what I would say is if you look back to when we first -- or last, I should say, provided some disclosure on that was back in the first quarter of 2020, the order of magnitude that we articulated then in terms of the impact coming from the portfolio from a credit cycle is roughly same order of magnitude today. Ken, I don't know if you want to elaborate further on that. Ken Tanji : Yes. Just on your second part of your question, Erik, on sort of what underpins our plans -- what is underpinning our plans is sort of the expectation of a slowing economy and the early stages of a mild recession, which would include an elevated level of credit losses and in-rating migration. And beyond that, though, we also, as Rob just described, we have a variety of stress testing that we also consider. And those are the -- that's what we look at when we set our plans for the year. Erik Bass : Got it. Thank you. And then I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your strategic view of the US individual life business going forward. Just under LDTI, I think your guidance implies this business will be roughly breakeven, are almost slightly profitable on a GAAP basis. So are there any actions that you're considering or that you could take to improve the profitability of this business? Caroline Feeney : Hi, Erik, it's Caroline, and I'll take your question. So obviously, as you state, LDTI is expected to result in a meaningful decline in earnings this year for the Life business as AOI recognition will be deferred. While this impacts the earnings pattern, it doesn't change the economics of the business. So however, even under the impact of LDTI, we are proactively looking at ways to enhance the earnings power of the business. And we do remain encouraged by the actions we've taken to pivot to less interest rate sensitive products, as well as to diversify our overall product portfolio. And Erik, this obviously also includes the recent launch of our indexed variable universal life product, FlexGuard Life, which is ramping up nicely. We do expect our AOI to grow over time based on core growth, the compounding impact of new business written at attractive returns. And also higher reinvestment rates. And overall, we remain very committed to the individual Life business. We do continue to believe that this business is core to Prudential's purpose and we like the growth potential with our overall brand as well as our product breadth and certainly our distribution strength. And we also like the additive mix that the Life business brings, particularly the longevity and mortality balance. And in terms of our pivot, our business -- our new business, Erik, it's really a much more favorable risk profile and we're writing new business at attractive returns. Erik Bass : Great. Thank you. Caroline Feeney : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question today is coming from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Jimmy Bhullar : Hey. Just a question first on your commercial mortgage loan book. If you could discuss your confidence in that portfolio? And any stats that you could give us in the loans that have either been restructured and how that sort of trended over the past several months? Rob Falzon : Jimmy, it's Rob. I'll handle that. First, just from a sort of a high-level standpoint, the real estate portfolio is a very high-quality portfolio, broadly diversified both by geography and in the underlying property types. And we really benefit from PGIM's direct origination capabilities in this arena. They've got a management team there that's got well over 25 years industry experience and deep knowledge of the markets and a proven track record in that area. When we look at the quality of the portfolio, it's actually holding up quite well. You can see that our CECL reserve for that portfolio is just a little under $200 million. That's about 39 basis points against the portfolio, then that is up from about 21 basis points a year ago. But that's primarily a general reserve. We only have a single loan with a specific reserve in there, an office property. But outside of that, the reserve really comprises our estimation of losses across the portfolio based on historical data. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. And then the acquisition of Deerpath, should we assume that there's going to be sort of a diversion of funds from buyback to fund this, or should we not expect any impact on your buyback plans. Charlie Lowrey : So, Jimmy, let me take that and just raise it up a level and then I'll answer your question directly. We have said when we think about buybacks and the application of capital, that we want to be good stewards of capital. And we have and will continue to demonstrate a very disciplined and balanced approach to the redeployment of capital within our businesses and to our shareholders and other stakeholders. And you saw in the first quarter, we returned over $700 million to shareholders, which included the 15th consecutive annual increase in our dividend. So -- but if I take a step back for a moment, let me share with you some observations about how we think about capital allocation and particular optimization, which fits to your point. We look across all our businesses, both domestically and internationally, to ensure that we're optimizing capital deployment. So we'll continue to look for ways to optimize capital to maximize outcomes for all our stakeholders by balancing investments in our businesses and business growth, programmatic M&A, and returning capital to shareholders while maintaining our financial strength. And you saw examples of all four of that this quarter, right? We continue to invest in our businesses. We did programmatic M&A with the Deerpath Capital. We returned capital to shareholders, both in the form of dividends and share repurchases and we made an announcement to repay hybrid, which lowers our -- the hybrid, which lowers our leverage. So we'll continue to evaluate all these things as we go forward, especially in the current macroeconomic environment. But as an example, this quarter, we were able to do all of that given the strength of our capital position, given the cash flow we've generated and given our strategy going forward. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Elyse Greenspan : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the capital side of things. When we -- after the $1.5 billion debt pay down, right, you guys at around are at 3.1 at the holdco. So can you just give me -- I'm just looking for a sense of where you want to run relative to that target? And then the answer to that question, can you give us a sense of just the timing of dividends that you're going to take out of PICA this year as well as any repatriation of capital from Japan? Ken Tanji : Yes. Hey, Elyse, it's Ken. As I mentioned before, we've been planning for the -- all of the $1.5 billion for some time. That's how we built our plans and then in terms of trends and timing 1Q is typically a lower quarter for cash flow from subsidiaries and that\u2019s what we saw this quarter, first quarter and it tends to be higher in subsequent quarters. All of our businesses are profitable in generating cash flow. That includes PICA and PGIM, and we expect cash flows from them as we progress through the year and we expect to operate within our $3 billion to $5 billion of holdco HLA range. It will be higher in some periods and lower in others and that's why we define the range. But overall, we're proceeding very in line with our plans. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks. And then the second quarter baseline, the 320 EPS, that assumes normal PII, but prepays and alternative real estate income could be lower just given the volatility we're seeing in markets. So how should we think about just PII, not only for the Q2, but also for the balance of the year? Rob Falzon : Elyse, it's Rob. I'll try to address that. First, with regard to the returns on the alternatives portion of the portfolio, distinguishing that from the prepayments part of your question, market performance is going to continue to impact returns. That's primarily in the private equity component of our portfolio. That correlation is directional. How it manifests in any given quarter is kind of dependent on the conditions in the quarter. And I'd also note that within that PE allocation that we've got, about a quarter of that is actually allocated to mezzanine distressed debt and infrastructure. So not entirely correlated with the markets. And also remind you that the PE is reported on a one quarter lag. So if you look at equity performance in the first quarter, that would be some indication of the portfolio on a go-forward basis. With regard to prepayments, we did see a reduced level of prepayments on a higher interest rate environment. And I think it's -- that's a trend that we're anticipating on a go-forward basis. Maybe I'll just close with going back to the alternatives portfolio, just to emphasize, we're -- our alternatives are invested for the long-term. And over that horizon, we expect to continue to benefit from the dedicated team that we've got. And from the diversification that we have in the portfolio and the efforts we've had around manager selection, including within the real estate component of that to the part of your question, real estate is actually a relatively modest component of our alternatives, it's 15-ish or so percent. Elyse Greenspan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Alex Scott : Hey, good morning. First one I had is on annuities. That was a place where, I guess, relative to the presentation, you all put out at the time of the LDTI recast, the result came in much, much stronger this quarter. So I just wanted to see if you had a perspective on sort of what changed there versus what you were expecting at the time of the LDTI recast? And one of the things that struck me was NII, and I know you all have talked about sensitivity to the NII on shorter-duration collateral securities and cash. And I just wanted to see if you could provide any kind of sensitivity to help us think through how to model that, as we think through federal funds at the levels they are today versus some of the projections that have them declining? Caroline Feeney : Yeah. So Alex, it's Caroline, and I'll take your questions. So first of all, I would point out that the strong earnings in our Retirement Strategies business continues to reflect the ongoing growth that we're experiencing in this business. And I'll just start with the institutional retirement business, which ended the quarter with record account values of $253 billion. Our account values benefited from nearly $4 billion in sales, including the best first quarter ever in our pension risk transfer business. And then if I move to the individual retirement strategy side, we continue to see strong sales here as well, anchored by our FlexGuard suite of indexed variable annuities. In less than three years, we've delivered over $13 billion in total sales, clearly reinforcing our leadership position as a top five player in the indexed variable annuity space. And complementing that success, our fixed annuity offerings saw continued strong growth and represented over 30% of our sales for the quarter. Compounding this growth story from an earnings perspective, Alex, is our robust disciplined pricing. So when we go to market, our pricing clearly is fair, competitive and also accretive to shareholder value. We're also able to maintain this profitable growth trajectory, thanks to the strength of our brand, our leading distribution capabilities as well as strong execution. I would also point out that earnings in the Retirement Strategies business are seeing a benefit from tailwinds provided by the current interest rate environment in both short- term as well as long-term rates, which are driving favorable spread income. And then finally, we remain focused on expense discipline and continuous improvement in operating efficiency with an eye towards protecting the bottom line. So it's really a combination of all of these factors that contribute to the strong earnings we continue to see in the retirement strategies business, which are well-positioned for continued growth. Alex Scott : Got it. Maybe just a follow-up to that, I mean the portion that's the sensitivity to shorter term interest rates, is there any way for us to gauge how that may react if the Fed run trade begins to decline. It just seemed like there's maybe a bit more leverage than I would have guessed on the upside to that. So I don't want to overlook \u2013 estimate? Caroline Feeney : So Alex, clearly, the earnings, as I mentioned, are seeing a benefit from the current interest rate environment, and that's both on the short-term as well as the long-term rates driving the favorable spread income. And if we were to see rates decline, then clearly, we would see a reduction in the spread income that we earn. But I also want to reiterate the point that I made that business growth continues to be a driver of earnings as well. And so even if there was a reduction in rates, we would clearly expect that to persist. Alex Scott : Got it. Yeah, I understand. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler. Your line is now live. John Barnidge : Thank you very much for the opportunity, and good morning. My question is around the group insurance. Persistency decline in both group life and disability, can you maybe talk about the drivers, seeing any impact from deployment reductions as the larger jumbo into the market? Caroline Feeney : Of course, John. It's Caroline, and I'll take your question. So let me just start by taking a step back and pointing out that at core focus of our group business is to remain price disciplined and profit focused. And that just really means pursuing smart growth. We saw a 2% growth from the year ago quarter and earned premiums and fees, and that was primarily driven by growth in disability and supplemental health. And while we saw strong sales in the first quarter in Group Life, the year-over-year decline in annualized new business premiums is attributable to our strong discipline when it comes to pricing new sales. So specific to your question on persistency, John, I'll highlight our approach to and as well as our experience with renewals, which, as you know, are heavily weighted towards the January 1st effective date. When it comes to pursuing renewals, if we are unable to achieve our desired level of profitability through appropriate rate action, we choose not to retain that business, which is, in fact, just really addition by subtraction. So from a group life persistency perspective, you're actually seeing those principles in action here in the first quarter. And the trend in the persistency ratio in our group disability business remains strong. John, you also asked about unemployment and the impacts there. With regard to any signs of impacts from workforce reductions, we really aren't seeing any impact on our business at this point in time. While there clearly have been quite a few large layoff announcements that have generated their share of headlines, overall employment conditions continue to be strong. We're seeing tight labor markets with low current unemployment and a large number of job openings. So this favorable employment trend is evident in the results of our group disability business and our results reflect favorable macroeconomic tailwinds, as well as strong execution on proactive claims management. So broadly, we view the risk of unemployment impacts to our business as low over the short to medium-term. And also, I would mention, John, historically increases in unemployment rates over a sustained period could drive an increase in disability claims. However, they would typically take six to 12 months to cycle into our results. John Barnidge : Thank you very much. And another question around Japan. I believe they're lifting pandemic related restrictions, categorizing COVID like infectious disease or like the influenza. Can you talk about -- is that anticipated to improve or enhance distribution, or are there any product launches planned around that? Thank you. Andy Sullivan : So John, it's Andy. I'll take your question. But let me lift it up a bit and just talk about Japan sales overall. Our Japan operation is competitively advantaged with outstanding distribution, really strong product and a great brand. We were very pleased with the quarter sales results where we had a 4% improvement over the sequential quarter and a 10% improvement year-over-year. That success was well spread out as we experienced material year-over-year growth in the Life Planner, Life Consultant and bank channels. To your question on product, our work on innovating our product designs continues as we drive to ensure that we meet the needs for retirement, wealth transfer and unmet health and care needs. We also continue to drive our efforts around customer experience with a particular focus on strengthening the product and the offering and the experience to small to midsized enterprises. As far as the pandemic related effects and restrictions, we are seeing the COVID related sales challenges begin to subside. But that being said, we are still seeing impacts from a recruiting and retention perspective. But if you look at everything in aggregate, we're quite optimistic about our ability to grow these businesses over time as it always is, our priorities are to deliver strong value to our customers while achieving very, very healthy levels of profitability. John Barnidge : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question today is coming from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Suneet Kamath : Thanks. I just want to go back to Charlie, an answer that you gave to a previous question on capital, I think it was Jimmy's question. So I just wanted to confirm, are you committing to the $1 billion of buyback for the year, or it just felt like maybe there was a little bit of vagueness in your response. I just wanted to give you the opportunity to clarify. Charlie Lowrey : No, thanks, Suneet. There is no vagueness in my response. But to be clear, the Board has authorized $1 billion of buybacks, and we will evaluate that each quarter according to the macroeconomic conditions. So there is no wavering per se, but we can't guarantee that we are going to -- that would be a forward-looking statement, which we can't make. So no equivocation in our desire to execute on the program. But again, we can't make forward-looking statements. Suneet Kamath : Okay. That's clear. Thanks for that. And then I guess, I don't know if it's for Rob or Ken, when you talk about on Slide 11 about the mortgage loan portfolio and the process that you go through evaluating at least once a year, what is that process like? Is that an internal process where you use your team, or do you go externally and hire firms to kind of confirm or validate your approach? Just curious how you think about that? Rob Falzon : Hi, it's Rob, Suneet, and I\u2019ll take the question. So it\u2019s a rolling process, first of all. So it goes on throughout the year. It's not a single date point in time when we do appraisals. We have a very rigorous process around this which is we have a central team that sort of runs the appraisals on all of the properties, and that's a combination of using outsourced appraisers in order to give us input into those appraisals, but ultimately, the appraisal is an internal appraisal. We use outsiders for inputs into the appraisal and even both from a data standpoint and from a valuation standpoint, we -- the internal appraisal process is one that will look at all that external data and valuations but we put constraints around it. For instance, we have floors on cap rates that vary according to different property types that we use in our own internal valuations. That's resulted as we've noted in the past, in a phenomenon where our internal appraisals have generally been at the time in which we make them about 10% lower than what the external appraisals are that we've received in those processes. So what you see when we quote our valuations, we're doing it based on that internal view informed by external appraisals, but very much in an internal number with a level of conservatism that's applied on it. Suneet Kamath : Makes sense. And if I could sneak one more in just on Japan again. So higher rates in Japan is a relatively new phenomenon. So I'm just curious, one, is that changing kind of customer behavior in terms of products? And then relatedly, I think maybe a quarter or so ago, you guys were having some issues with lapses in the foreign currency products. So just curious if there's an update there in terms of if that's continuing or if it's stabilized, that would be helpful. Thanks. Andy Sullivan : Sure. It's Andy. I'll take the question. Let me start with the second half of your question. So on surrenders. So as we discussed last quarter, our elevated level of surrenders began to decelerate in December. And we've absolutely seen that continue into quarter one, as the surrenders continue to subside all the way through the quarter. So we're seeing that come back and subside pretty consistently. As far as the higher rates, and obviously, when we say that, higher yen rates, higher US interest rates, I would -- as I would always say, higher interest rates are good for Prudential, are good for our businesses, and they're good for our Japanese business. Obviously, that's from an earnings perspective, but also higher yields give us greater flexibility in our product designs and allows us to deliver additional value to our customers while delivering additional value to our shareholders. So, all-in-all, we see these as good trends and good things. Suneet Kamath : Got it. Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Your line is now live. Tracy Benguigui : Thank you. What drove elevated mortality in the first quarter versus what you typically see? I guess, I'm just curious if you saw an early flu season last quarter that was a pull forward or not? Caroline Feeney : Sure, Tracy. It's Caroline. And thanks for your question. The Life business typically experiences elevated seasonal mortality in the first quarter, and that's consistent with what we see across the industry. And certainly, this year was no exception. And along with the industry, we even saw some excess seasonal mortality, and that was due to the impact from COVID, flu and also other respiratory illnesses. We also saw a higher incidence of large face value claims within our Life business. And going forward, Tracy, we do believe that COVID has transitioned to an endemic state and therefore, may still contribute to some amount of elevated mortality over the near to medium term. I would just point out, however, that the overall trend is better than the two previous winters, reinforcing our belief that we will return to pre-pandemic mortality levels in the long term. And finally, even though we did see some unfavorable mortality experience in the quarter, our diverse mix of mortality and longevity businesses helps to mitigate some of that experience over longer-term horizons. Tracy, you also asked about flu season last year and there was no evidence of an early flu season in our book last year. Tracy Benguigui : Very helpful. I appreciate that. The next question, I'd like to ask you about your office loan maturities in the next 24 months. Our review of stat filings, it looks like it's about $500 million. Can you speak to the feasibility of extension? Do you feel like borrowers could either purchase an interest rate cap if the loan is floating or reduce the loan balance by putting in more equity with the current debt yields allow that? Rob Falzon : Sure, Tracy. It's Rob. The -- about -- actually a little over 10% of the portfolio matures in the next two years. So you think about it, just looking at a little further from the statistic that you quoted. The -- recall that our portfolio is almost exclusively a fixed rate portfolio as opposed to floating rate. And so, when you look at the differentiation, the differences on the rollover of the portfolio are going to be looking at what's happened at the long end of the curve versus the short end of the curve where obviously been more dramatic at the short end of the curve for those that have been borrowing on a floating rate basis. Because of the relatively low loan to values we have across our portfolio, and we gave the statistics on that, it's mid-50% on average LTV as we roll over loans. And incidentally, the office portfolio is very much in line with that overall portfolio statistic. So as we're rolling over our loans, we're not particularly concerned about the sufficiency of equity in order to be able to refinance, even if it requires a higher level of loan and LTV from where we are. Tracy Benguigui : Thank you. Very helpful. Operator : Thank you. And your next question is coming from Michael Ward from Citi. Your line is now live. Michael Ward : Thanks guys for squeezing me in. Maybe just on commercial real estate. I was wondering about the slide on the REIT debt. I was just wondering if you could expand on that and help us understand how it fits in the spectrum and how -- if we should think about the credit risk they're similar to like a direct commercial mortgage loan? Rob Falzon : It's Rob again. Mike, I would think about the REIT portfolio as more akin to our private placement portfolio than the mortgage portfolio. So while mortgages of the underlying assets within the businesses, they are larger, more diversified businesses than what you're going to find in a typical single asset mortgage loan, it's about -- that REIT portfolio is about 2% of our assets. It's 97% investment grade. It's very well-diversified by geography and property type. And like all of our private placements and benefits a strong package of covenants as a result of our direct origination capabilities and that loan portfolio is primarily, if not almost entirely a result of that direct origination within PGIM. So like we do across the rest of the private placement portfolio, we actually feel quite good about the strength of those loans and the performance of them in the down cycle vis-\u00e0-vis comparatively rated public securities. Michael Ward : Thanks Rob. And then somewhat and relatedly, I believe PGIM\u2019s one of the bigger CLO managers, I was just wondering if you had any perspective or outlook for that asset class, given broader credit risk? Rob Falzon : It's Rob, I'll take it again. And I'll defer to Andy if he wants to jump in on me to talk more specifically about PGIM. But Mike as we \u2013 to think about CLOs, first of all from our own portfolio, we are solely a holder of AAA securities within the CLO, within the general account portfolio. We have some miniscule exposure below AAA as a result of being a CLO manager, PGIM being a CLO manager. We do European CLOs, we need to have retention there of a relatively modest amount, so it's inconsequential. But outside of that, it's exclusively a AAA portfolio. As we look at the CLO space, we find good value in the AAA and even the AA space and -- but we're more conservative in our views as to what can happen in a stress environment once you get into the single A and obviously the BBB and subordinated tranches of that. Michael Ward : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lowrey for any further or closing comments. Charlie Lowrey : Okay. Thank you again for joining us today. I hope we demonstrated to you the progress we're making in transforming Prudential to deliver sustainable long-term growth and to meet the evolving needs of our customers. We're confident in our strategy and the strength of our company. For nearly 150 years, Prudential has been focused on creating value for our customers and other stakeholders who we will continue to serve as we strive to be a global leader in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security. Thank you again for joining us, and have a good day. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Later, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I will now turn the floor over to Mr. Bob McLaughlin. Please, go ahead. Bob McLaughlin : Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today\u2019s call are Charlie Lowrey, Chairman and CEO; Rob Falzon, Vice Chairman; Andy Sullivan, Head of International Businesses and PGIM, our Global Investment Manager; Caroline Feeney, Head of U.S. Businesses; Ken Tanji, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by Charlie, Rob, and Ken, and then we will take your questions. Today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of such measures to the comparable GAAP measure and a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, please see the slides titled Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures in the appendix to today\u2019s presentation and the quarterly financial supplement, both of which can be found on our website at investor.prudential.com. And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Charlie. Charlie Lowrey : Thank you, Bob. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our second quarter results reflect continued momentum across our businesses, including the fourth consecutive quarter of underlying earnings growth and record operating earnings for group insurance. We continue to execute on our strategy by reducing market sensitivity and increasing our capital flexibility, enhancing our capabilities and optimizing operating efficiency to support long-term growth. Our strategic progress and financial strength position us well to navigate the current macroeconomic environment, and maintain our disciplined approach to capital deployment. Turning to slide 3. I\u2019ll start this morning by noting two significant milestones demonstrating how we are reducing market sensitivity and increasing our capital flexibility. During the second quarter, we completed a reinsurance transaction for a $10 billion block of traditional variable annuities and received proceeds of $650 million. With this transaction, I\u2019m pleased that we have achieved our objective of lowering the proportion of traditional variable annuities, while continuing our progress in pivoting to less market sensitive and higher growth products. Additionally, last week, we announced another transaction to reinsure a $12.5 billion block of guaranteed universal life policies, which will be accretive to earnings. We expect to receive approximately $450 million of proceeds when the transaction closes, which is expected to be in the fourth quarter of this year. We also continue to deliver on our vision to increase access to investing insurance and retirement security by enhancing our capabilities and customer experiences and by expanding our distribution channels and products to more people around the world. In Latin America, we continued to expand our distribution through the Mercado Libre platform and added 150,000 new customers last quarter. Also, Prudential of Brazil achieved a record sales quarter, driven by strong performance by Life Planner and continued expansion of the third-party distribution channel. Prudential of Brazil is now the third largest life insurance company in the country, growing at twice the market average and reaching more than 3.5 million customers. In addition, we see continued opportunity and feel we are well-positioned in the international longevity risk transfer market, as we completed more than $3.5 billion of transaction in the second quarter. In the U.S. our individual retirement strategies business achieved annuity sales of $1.9 billion in the second quarter, a 20% increase year-over-year, and the highest since the fourth quarter of 2020. Our FlexGuard suite has reached $15 billion of sales over the past three years. And our fixed annuity sales in the quarter represented over one-third of new business, as we innovate our portfolio of annuity solutions to meet customer needs. As we look ahead, we are well-positioned as a global leader at the intersection of asset management and insurance. We are confident that our strategy in mutually reinforcing business mix, which leverages the combined strength of our brand, global asset and liability origination capabilities, and multichannel distribution will enable us to drive future growth and continue to expand access to investing insurance and retirement security. At the same time, we continued to enhance the ways we leverage technology to improve customer experiences and optimize operating efficiency. One recent example is, Model My Retirement, a new digital tool designed to help institutional pension customers gain a better understanding of their retirement benefits and adjust their financial planning accordingly. Customers can now quickly and seamlessly get an estimate of their available annuity benefits through our self-service website. We also announced a strategic partnership with Nayya, a leading benefits experience platform. The new partnership will allow group insurance clients to harness AI and data science capabilities to make more informed workplace benefit decisions. And we are also using chatbot technology and robotic process automation to reduce transaction processing time across our U.S. businesses. As part of our continuous improvement framework, we are focusing on creating a linear, faster and more agile company, so that we can better meet the needs of our customers, while driving growth and efficiency. We have made good progress in this area, having exceeded the target we established two years ago, but we think there is more work we can do. We are evaluating additional opportunities including further evolving our operating model, simplifying our organizational structure and streamlining decision making. Turning now to slide 4. Prudential\u2019s rock solid balance sheet and robust risk and capital management frameworks have allowed us to confidently navigate the current macro environment. Our AA financial strength is supported by : our strong capital position, including approximately $50 billion of unrealized insurance margin; $4.5 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the second quarter, which does not include the $650 million of proceeds from the traditional variable annuities reinsurance transaction that was completed this quarter; and a high-quality, well-diversified investment portfolio and disciplined approach to asset liability management. Moving to slide 5. Our disciplined approach to capital deployment coupled with the added capital flexibility achieved through our de-risking transactions enables us to effectively balance investing in the long-term growth of our businesses, with returning capital to shareholders. In the second quarter, we returned approximately $700 million in capital to shareholders. And with that, Rob will now provide an overview of our second quarter financial results and an update on our business performance. Rob Falzon : Thank you, Charlie. I\u2019ll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, U.S. and International businesses. I\u2019ll begin on slide 6 with our financial results the second quarter of 2023. Our pre-tax adjusted operating income was $1.4 billion or $2.94 per share on an after tax basis. These results reflect underlying business growth, including the benefits from a higher interest rate environment and favorable underwriting experience, partially offset by elevated expenses and lower variable investment and fee income. Our GAAP net income was $576 million lower than our after tax adjusted operating income, primarily driven by mark-to-market losses on currency and interest rate derivatives, and losses on fixed maturity sales, driven by higher rates. Turning to the operating results from our businesses compared to the year ago quarter. PGIM, our global investment manager, had lower asset management fees, driven by rising rates and net outflows and higher expenses to support growth initiatives, while other related revenues increased primarily from higher seed and co-investment earnings. Results of our U.S. businesses primarily reflected a more favorable, comparable impact from our annual assumption update, higher spread income and more favorable underwriting, partially offset by the absence of one-time gain from the sale of PALAC in the prior year quarter and lower fee income. The increase in earnings in our International businesses primarily reflected higher emerging markets earnings and a favorable impact from our annual assumption update and other refinements. Turning to slide 7. PGIM, our global active investment manager has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, equities, and alternatives. PGIM\u2019s long-term investment performance remains attractive with 80% or more of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last 5 and 10 year periods. In addition, our short-term performance has improved since the last quarter, with 80% of assets exceeding their benchmarks over a one year period. PGIM experienced third-party net outflows of $5.2 billion in the quarter, primarily from public equity strategies. Institutional outflows were primarily driven by client redemptions for liquidity needs and retail outflows were driven by sub-advised equity mandates. As the investment engine of Prudential, the success and growth of PGIM end of our U.S. and international insurance and retirement businesses are mutually reinforcing. PGIM\u2019s asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise, and access to institutional and other sources of private capital are a competitive advantage, helping our businesses bring enhanced solutions and create more value for our customers. Our insurance and retirement businesses in turn provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated net flows, as well as unique access to insurance liabilities. In addition, we continue to grow both organically and through acquisitions, our private alternatives and credit business, which has assets of approximately $234 billion across private, corporate and infrastructure credit, real estate equity and debt, and secondary private equity. Capital deployment across PGIM\u2019s private assets platform increased from the prior quarter to $8 billion, benefiting from strong private placement and direct lending originations. Turning to slide 8, our U.S. businesses produce diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income, and benefit from our complimentary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continued to drive towards a higher value, higher growth, and less market sensitive mix of earnings, as evidenced by the de-risking transactions that Charlie mentioned, invest in our businesses to deliver best in class customer experiences and expand our addressable market with new financial solutions, leveraging the capabilities across Prudential. Retirement strategies generated strong sales of $7.6 billion in the second quarter across its institutional and individual lines of business. Our institutional retirement business has leading market capabilities, which helped to produce second quarter sales of $5.7 billion, including $3.6 billion of international reinsurance transactions, as well as strong stable value sales. Retirement account values were a record high at the end of the second quarter. In individual retirement, our product pivots have resulted in contingent strong sales of more simplified solutions like FlexGuard and FlexGuard Income, representing approximately 65% of sales and increased fixed annuity sales that accounted for approximately one third of sales this quarter. Our individual life sales increased 27% from the year ago quarter, reflecting our earlier product pivot strategy with variable life products representing approximately 74% of sales in the quarter. And group insurance sales were up 33% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by growth in disability and supplemental health. We\u2019ve been very pleased with the momentum we are seeing in our group insurance business as we execute our strategy of product and segment diversification, while leveraging technology to increase operating efficiency and enhance the customer experience. Our record results this quarter include favorable group life and disability underwriting experience, which resulted in a benefits ratio of 81%. Turning to slide 9, our international businesses include our Japanese Life Insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multi-channel distribution model, as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in targeted high growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high quality service and expanding our distribution and product offerings. Our needs based approach and protection product focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. In emerging markets, we\u2019re focused on creating a selective portfolio of businesses in regions where customer needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market leading businesses, and where the financial enterprise can add value. Our international business sales were up 9%, compared to the year ago quarter. Life Planner sales were up 12% driven by record sales in Brazil, as well as higher single premium U.S. dollar sales in Japan. Gibraltar sales were up 6%, primarily driven by growth in the bank channel. As we look ahead, we are well positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We continue to focus on investing in growth businesses and markets, delivering industry leading customer experiences, and creating the next generation of financial solutions to serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. And with that, I\u2019ll now hand it over to Ken. Ken Tanji : Thanks Rob. I\u2019ll begin on slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the third quarter of 2023 relative to our second quarter results. As noted, pre-tax adjusted operating income in the second quarter was $1.4 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.94 on an after tax basis. To get a sense of how our third quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items. First, our annual assumption update and other refinements resulted in a net benefit of $16 million in the second quarter, not [ph] included an adjustment for the third quarter. The potential exists for continued revaluation of real estate investments and lower prepayment activity due to the current market and economic conditions. Variable investment income will vary from period to period, however, over time, it has exceeded our expectations. Third, underwriting experience was below expectations by $5 million in the second quarter, and we expect $20 million of favorable seasonality in the third quarter. And last, we include an adjustment of $90 million for other items, primarily due to elevated expenses in the second quarter. These adjustments combined get us to a baseline of $3.26 per share for the third quarter. I\u2019ll note if you exclude items specific to the third quarter, earnings per share would be $3.35. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power continued to improve due to business growth, including the benefit of higher interest rates, partially offset by higher investments in our capabilities and growth initiatives. I would also note that due to continued opportunities to build capabilities, pursue growth initiatives and gain efficiency, we expect an increased level of investments in these areas that will be reflected in corporate and other. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the third quarter. Turning to slide 11. Our capital position continues to support our AA financial strength rating. Our cash and liquid assets were $4.5 billion at the high-end of our liquidity target range. Our regulatory capital ratios were well above our targets and we have substantial off-balance sheet resources, including $9 billion of contingent capital and liquidity facilities. We remain thoughtful in our capital deployment, balancing preservation of financial strength and flexibility, investment in our businesses and shareholder distributions. Turning to slide 12 and in summary, we are transforming our business for sustainable growth. We continue to navigate the current macro environment with the financial strength of our rock solid balance sheet, and we maintain a balanced and disciplined approach to capital deployment. Now I\u2019ll turn it to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Tom Gallagher : Good morning. First question is, can you talk a little bit about the dividend flows, the dividends that were paid up in the quarter from the subs, it seemed like a pretty strong capital generation quarter. So, a little bit behind what drove that. And relatedly, the capital that you\u2019re going to be -- that you received for the VA transaction or the freed up capital and the SGUL deals later this year, would you expect to be able to dividend those up and use the proceeds? And then, finally, the IMR rule change, can you comment on whether that affected your RBC this quarter? Do you expect that to affect it later in the year? Thanks. Ken Tanji : Ys. Hey Tom, it\u2019s Ken. Yes, we executed planned distributions from our businesses in the second quarter. That cash flow reflected dividends from PICA and Japan and other affiliated cash flows from subsidiaries as well. And again, it was all part of our plans for the year. Our capital position as a result is very healthy. Our regulatory capital ratios are above our AA objectives that would include the benefit of the recent VA reinsurance transaction, but does not yet reflect the GUL transaction, which will be subject to close later. And again, our Holdco assets were $4.5 billion, relatively flat from the prior quarter and a high end of our target range. So again, we\u2019ll benefit from the GUL transaction when it closes and the NAIC IMR proposal when that is adopted. So that\u2019s not yet in our RBC ratios. And these will all be key considerations for dividends from PICA to PFI in the second half of the year, again, with the close of GUL and NAIC\u2019s decision on negative IMR. So overall, we feel very good about our capital position and the outlook for our flexibility looking ahead. Tom Gallagher : Okay. Thank, Ken. And then just a follow-up. On the potential IMR changes, I think the limitation is now looking like 10% of surplus. Can you give a little bit of color for -- I think you had had something like $1.8 billion negative impact from that in 2022. Would you expect to be able to reverse most of that, some of that? And would we still be looking at potential limitations or future losses if rates keep going up here, I guess, is the other follow-up on that. Thanks. Ken Tanji : Yes. So you\u2019re right, Tom. The proposal is subject to a limitation of 10% of statutory surplus with adjusted for some exclusions. And for us, that\u2019s about $1.3 billion or that you can think of that as about 26 RBC points. So, that\u2019s what it would represent for us where we sit and where interest rate sits right now. Operator : Our next question is coming from Jimmy Bhullar from JP Morgan. Jimmy Bhullar : So first, just a question on your Japan business and how do you -- how are you thinking about potential changes in your new sales mix given changes in the capital regime and also just fluctuations recently we\u2019ve seen in terms of interest rates and currencies in Japan? Andy Sullivan : Hey Jimmy, it\u2019s Andy. I\u2019ll take your question. Our Japan operation, as you know, is competitively advantaged with outstanding distribution, great product and a strong brand. And we\u2019ve been quite pleased with the sales results this quarter as we experienced year-over-year growth in our LP, our LC and our bank channels. That growth was aided by higher U.S. dollar product sales. But we\u2019ve also been investing into the business. Clearly, our work on innovating our product designs and enhancing our customer experience is paying off. As we look at the interest rate changes, as we always say, overall higher interest rates are good for Prudential and are good for our Japanese businesses. We do believe that those higher interest rates will obviously give us greater flexibility in our product design and then delivering value back to our customers. So, while we may see a shift of the mix between U.S. dollar and yen denominated, we think we\u2019ll still see strong demand. And as we look forward, we\u2019re optimistic about our ability to continue to grow the Japan business and deliver shareholder value. Jimmy Bhullar : Does the change in capital affect your sort of the economics of your products between U.S. dollar and yen denominated? Rob Falzon : Hey Jimmy, it\u2019s Rob. So, a couple of thoughts as you\u2019re referring to the eventual adoption of ESR First point ESR is still a work in process and is not scheduled for adoption until like 2025. And so, we continue to work with the JFSA and with the industry to fine-tune the ESR regime, which is, to date, largely mirrored the regime that\u2019s been established on the international side. As currently constructed, it would cause us to look creatively at how we manage our book of business and our sales. So, I don\u2019t think it would necessarily change our distribution and our sales, but where we hold the assets against those sales could be in Japan or it could be reinsured to other jurisdictions in order to be able to make sure that we\u2019re matching the economics of the products that we\u2019re selling into the economics of the statutory regimes in which they reside. So, we\u2019re comfortable that either through a combination of efficacy and getting sort of the right economic outcomes and/or the other levers that we have available to us that we\u2019ll be able to sort of continue the balance of sales that we have and sort of manage the way in which we capitalize and reserve those sales. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. And then just shifting on to PGIM. The negative flows this quarter, how much of that is something that\u2019s maybe Prudential related that might continue into the second half versus maybe just overall industry-wide issues that a lot of your peers have had in asset management recently as well? Andy Sullivan : So Jimmy, it\u2019s Andy. I\u2019ll take your question, and I\u2019ll just hit it broadly to talk about flows for the quarter. As we\u2019ve talked about, flows are outcome of having great distribution, broadly diversified products and strong investment results. And we\u2019ve been a net flow winner over a multiyear period in PGIM, and we\u2019re quite confident in the strength of our capabilities. And as always, we\u2019re going to continue to manage this for the long term. That said, this quarter, we did see a material reduction in our outflows versus the previous quarters. On the retail end, outflows were $2.2 billion and were predominantly an equity story. We\u2019ve seen retail clients rebalancing their portfolios based on the heels of strong equity market appreciation. On the institutional side, the outflows were $3 billion for the quarter. Again, that\u2019s a material improvement over the previous quarters. These outflows included both equity and fixed income. The equity story for Institutional is the same as that for retail. It\u2019s client rebalancing. For fixed income, we saw some of our clients make asset allocation changes and other shift to passive. As far as an outlook, near term, we expect that this current investor behavior is going to continue. And to your question, our trend is consistent with what we\u2019re seeing across the rest of the industry. Over the longer term, we have a lot of confidence in our PGIM platform, and we know that we\u2019re going to return to strong positive flows and gain market share. Operator : Our next question is coming from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler. John Barnidge : Question on PGIM. I know they\u2019re an investment manager on some of these risk transferred assets. How long does that -- those agreements last? Can you talk about how the wind down of those assets would work? Thank you. Andy Sullivan : So John, it\u2019s Andy. I\u2019ll take it. Maybe I\u2019ll bring it up a level, just talk about in general as we do de-risking transactions. And in particular, the recent de-risking transactions we did in Individual Retirement Strategies and Individual Life. It is true, we\u2019ll lose some assets under management from the general account. But we -- as you\u2019ve noted, we worked hard and got an IMA. That is deal specific, how long they -- those IMAs go, depending deal to deal. But it does give us the ability to continue to manage a majority of the assets. And at the end of the day, if you look across the risk transactions that we\u2019ve done recently, it\u2019s not really going to have a material impact on PGIM earnings. Rob Falzon : Hey John, it\u2019s Rob. Maybe just a little further elaboration. In the reinsurance of the PDI transaction, recall that those are individual sort of client separate accounts. And so those -- the separate account business there is something that PGIM will continue to manage. With regard to the GUL business, the agreement that we have there is actually a 7-year initial IMA. And obviously, with good performance, we would expect to continue to be able to manage that even over a longer period of time. John Barnidge : And then my follow-up question, sticking with asset management business, do industry-wide headwinds lead to inorganic opportunities? And are there products or geographies you\u2019d want to get greater scale in? Andy Sullivan : John, it\u2019s Andy again. I\u2019ll take that. So -- and I\u2019ll start where I always start when we talk about this. We\u2019ve demonstrated a strong ability over a couple of decades to grow PGIM organically. So, we -- certainly, as we look at the programmatic M&A, we don\u2019t need it to grow. That being said, we do remain interested in augmenting the organic growth plans with programmatic M&A. If you look at what we\u2019ve done recently, Montana Capital Partners, PGIM Custom Harvest and now Deerpath, those are really good examples of the areas that we said we are going to lean into higher fee, higher growth. As we look forward, we\u2019re going to continue to work to globalize the business and lean into areas like private alternatives and real assets. Clearly, any disruptive environment can lead to opportunities. So, we make sure that we stay in the know and in the flow of what\u2019s going on in the industry. But as always, we will remain very patient and be disciplined in our approach. Operator : Your next question today is coming from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Ryan Krueger : I was hoping you could discuss the new open architecture platform that was referenced in the June press release and give some more specifics on really what you\u2019re looking to do there? Rob Falzon : Ryan, it\u2019s Rob. I\u2019ll take that. As we\u2019ve talked about in the past, we see really interesting opportunities that exist in the intersection of asset management and insurance you see evolving in the industry. And we\u2019re quite excited about what that implies for our ability to create avenues of growth, both in our insurance and our asset management businesses. So, we\u2019re being thoughtful about how we execute against that opportunity. And that includes organizing ourselves in a way so as to institutionalize our ongoing balance sheet optimization capability. So, think about that on the liability side as we\u2019re looking at reinsurance solutions to balance the use of captives, affiliates and third-party reinsurance, to continue to actively evaluate additional blocks, existing blocks of business for reinsurance and then also looking at flow or new sales solutions. On the asset side, it\u2019s about expanding our lens on the available assets or investments that can generate greater outlook for us. We\u2019re also expanding our capabilities to source those investments either directly or in partnership with others, including things like acquiring capabilities as we did with Deerpath. This is an important component of our broader strategy, which is around enhancing valuation by becoming higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble. Ryan Krueger : Just one follow-up there. I mean, should we think of this as also including a potential to bring in more third-party capital in a sidecar-like structured to back some of your new business in the future? Rob Falzon : I think we\u2019re looking at the full range of opportunities that would exist there. And so going from captive to third party and hybrid solutions that would exist in between that. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Wes Carmichael from Wells Fargo. Wes Carmichael : I just had a follow-up on Tom\u2019s question on the Holdco liquidity. So I think in the first quarter, that was roughly around $4.5 billion, ended this quarter at $4.5 billion. But if I kind of add up all the uses of capital in the quarter, from buybacks, dividends, I think there was $1.5 billion of callable debt. I think there were around $2.5 billion of uses in the period. So I\u2019m just curious, like were dividends accelerated? I know you said that they were planned, but was there any other affiliated borrowings? I\u2019m just trying to square that because it\u2019s a pretty sizable use of capital. and I\u2019m just trying to figure out where that came from. Ken Tanji : Yes. Hey Wes, it\u2019s Ken. No, it was all planned. So, the distributions we received were all planned, and we didn\u2019t issue any debt in the quarter either. In fact, as you recognize, we called some debt, which again was all planned. So -- and we didn\u2019t pull forward anything. So, it was all part of what our plans were for the year. So, I hope that helps. Wes Carmichael : And just maybe any thoughts around your kind of PRT pipeline? And just maybe how you think about that versus balancing that with like the longevity business and deploying capital to those two in the institutional retirement business? Caroline Feeney : Yes. Hi Wes. It\u2019s Caroline, and I\u2019ll take your question. So first of all, I\u2019d say, overall, we\u2019re very pleased with the strong results we saw across our entire Retirement Strategies business, with just over $7.5 billion in total sales and record institutional account values of $259 billion. This included $5.7 billion in our Institutional Retirement Strategies business, highlighted by a strong quarter in international reinsurance transactions. In terms of the pipeline overall, Wes, we continue to see strong opportunity in both the U.S. and global risk transfer markets with strong funding positions, both above 100%, and also high intent to transact. And I would be remiss not to mention what was just announced yesterday that we were selected to secure the pension benefits for about 2,000 of PSV and Gs retirees and their beneficiaries. And so far, we\u2019ve seen a record first half of the year in PRT. And while we expect to see a strong second half, we don\u2019t expect to surpass last year\u2019s record pipeline. We also see an extremely strong pipeline in the UK with funded positions that were 110%. And Wes, finally, I\u2019d say that given our expertise and our ability to manage large complex transactions along with our financial strength, we are well positioned to remain a leader in both markets. Operator : Your next question today is coming from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies. Suneet Kamath : I wanted to go back to the risk transfer deals just for a second. I think, Charlie, in your comments that you talked about achieving your goal on the VA side. And obviously, you\u2019ve done an SGUL transaction of late. Should we think about this as still ongoing activity for you, or are you sort of declaring victory here and kind of moving on to some of the more growth-oriented areas of your strategy? Charlie Lowrey : So, I would say, yes, to both of those. So, let me go through yes and, Suneet. So first, I\u2019ll go through each one sort of GUL and then the VA business. But, first, we are very pleased with the valuation we received for reinsuring the $12.5 billion block of guaranteed universal life policies that we announced last week. And as we said, we expect to receive approximately $450 million of proceeds when the transaction closes. The transaction will be accretive to earnings and will also reduce our market sensitivity and increase our capital flexibility. But would we consider an additional de-risking opportunity for Life sub block? Absolutely. As long as it met the strategic financial objectives and made sense to all our stakeholders. However, we\u2019re going to be disciplined in our approach as the individual life business continues to be core to our purpose. There\u2019s still significant potential for growth in the industry with a $12 trillion life insurance gap. And I think our strong Individual Life sales in the second quarter reflects our product pivot to less market-sensitive products. And from an enterprise perspective, our Life business helps balance our longevity with our mortality, so it remains important to us. On the VA side, it\u2019s a little bit of a different story, but there are some similarities. So we\u2019ve made considerable progress in reducing the market sensitivity and increasing our capital flexibility through the two transactions we\u2019ve done, and we\u2019re pleased with the valuations, again, that we received for reinsuring the $10 billion block of traditional variable annuities in the second quarter as well as the valuation for the $30 billion block we sold last year. But as a result of these transactions, as we\u2019ve said, and the natural runoff of this business, we have achieved the original objective that we established two years ago of blowing the proportion of traditional variable annuities. So, we\u2019re not in a position of having to do another transaction. Having said that, I want to be very clear that we\u2019ll continue to explore additional opportunities. But again, to state the obvious, but I\u2019ll state it, we\u2019ll only do something if it\u2019s in the best interest of all our stakeholders. But these transactions aren\u2019t only about de-risking. As you said, they\u2019re also about growth. So, while we\u2019ve been quite successful in our de-risking efforts as part of our strategy, we\u2019ve also been equally focused on growing with less market-sensitive products in our businesses, which you\u2019ve seen over the past few quarters. So, let me turn it over to Caroline for a minute because -- Caroline, would you want to talk about some of the progress we\u2019ve made with that part of our strategy? Caroline Feeney : Yes. Sure, Charlie. I\u2019d be happy to talk about how we\u2019re growing both these businesses. So first of all, in the Life business, as you said, we have a $12 trillion insurance gap. So we have a strong growth path forward, particularly when you think about the 50 million Americans who are currently underinsured. And as you mentioned, Charlie, we\u2019ve been very successful in pivoting our businesses to products that have a more favorable risk profile. Our new solutions have less embedded guarantees, they\u2019re less capital intensive, and we\u2019re writing new business at attractive returns. And as part of that, we saw strong sales in the quarter, up more than 25% over the prior year. And then on the individual retirement strategy side, we also continue to deliver strong sales and earnings. And in fact, we had our strongest sales quarter since the fourth quarter of 2020 and roughly a 20% increase over the prior year, and that\u2019s anchored by our FlexGuard suite of index variable annuities where we now have over $15 billion in cumulative sales, reinforcing our leadership position as a top 5 player and we also saw strong growth in our fixed annuity solutions, which were roughly one-third of our sales in the quarter and a significant increase over the prior year. So, I\u2019d say that our de-risking transactions along with our product pivots, have put us in a position to be more nimble with less market sensitivity and we see a meaningful opportunity for strong growth in both businesses going forward. Suneet Kamath : Got it. That makes sense. And then I just want to follow up. I think, Ken, in your prepared remarks, towards the end of your commentary, you talked about an increased level of investment, I think, in the corporate segment. I was just wondering if you could maybe size that and then some thoughts around for how long should we expect this incremental investment to be impacting that line. Thanks. Ken Tanji : Sure. The -- what I mentioned there was we have found new opportunities to invest in our capabilities and including growth opportunities and to gain efficiency. It\u2019s building on the programs that we\u2019ve executed in the past and we have increased our investment level there. We\u2019ve put a placeholder in there in terms of our run rate of about -- increase of about $25 million a quarter. And so that\u2019s -- given our plans now, we think that\u2019s appropriate planned increase in the pace of that. I just want to mention that the way we look at these opportunities is they\u2019re often company-wide, and that\u2019s why you see the expenses occurring in corporate, but the benefits then are reflected in our business segments. And then overall, from an expense level standpoint, we\u2019ve maintained basically a flat level of expenses, while we\u2019ve increased the level of capacity to invest in growth and capabilities and efficiencies, the efficiencies that we\u2019ve gained there of giving us that capacity. And so overall, we\u2019ve seen a flat level of expenses, improved level of capabilities, gained efficiencies and improve margins. Suneet Kamath : Got it. So you\u2019re not signaling that we need to reflect this $25 million in our corporate forecast going forward, it\u2019s more -- you\u2019re going to have this, but it\u2019s going to be offset by efficiencies and other things? Ken Tanji : Well, yes. But if you think about corporate, you should think about that as being an ongoing level of spend in corporate. Suneet Kamath : Got it. Just offset at the segments? Ken Tanji : Yes. Operator : Your next question is coming from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Erik Bass : Can you provide an update on your emerging markets businesses and what they\u2019re currently contributing to earnings and how they\u2019re growing from a bottom line perspective? Andy Sullivan : So Erik, it\u2019s Andy. I\u2019ll take the question. Let me just start by kind of reminding everyone of the strategy. Our focus on emerging markets is part of shifting our overall business mix to be higher growth. And we\u2019re quite pleased with the performance of our EM portfolio, which is obviously, and as you could see steadily growing and positively contributing to our earnings profile. I would highlight a couple of areas. We\u2019re very pleased with our results in Brazil and quite optimistic about our prospects. Brazil posted strong double-digit year-over-year sales growth with success across basically every channel Life Planner, Third-party and Group, and we had another record quarter. Second, I would highlight our Habitat joint venture has contributed steady growth since the acquisition in 2016. As of the end of the second quarter, total Habitat assets under management is $67 million. That makes us number one in Chile and number two overall in Latin America. Third, we\u2019re continuing to invest in emerging Asia and Africa. And then finally, and Charlie mentioned this sort of at the top of the call was this really exciting partnership we have with Mercado Pago, which is for financial subsidiary of Mercado Libre. Mercado Libre is the largest e-commerce system in Latin America and has given us access to the mass market in Latin America, and we\u2019re seeing really nice growth there. So, we don\u2019t necessarily break out the specific growth rates, but this is a portfolio that\u2019s becoming quite meaningful, with our particular emphasis being on how Brazil and Latin America are growing. And as we look forward, we really do believe we\u2019re in the right spot at the right time, and that growth will continue. Erik Bass : And then on PGIM, I was just hoping you could talk about the drivers of the other related revenues and your outlook for the second half of the year? I think the baseline outlook assumes that these normalize. So, is that an expectation or just a modeling assumption? Andy Sullivan : So thanks, Erik, it\u2019s Andy again. I will talk about the quarter, and then I\u2019ll talk about the outlook. In the second quarter, ORR came in at $31 million, which was about $20 million below our average expectation. The bottom line there is the slowdown in the real estate market is playing through as we predicted, and we\u2019ve seen lower agency earnings, lower real estate transactions fees and lower incentive fees. As far as looking forward, we would expect near term to see pressure remain on the ORR line really until the market experiences a rebound in the real estate transaction volumes. Operator : Our next question is coming from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Tracy Benguigui : Let\u2019s talk about RBC improvements. I appreciate that you quantify the IMR relief. How many RBC points are you expecting from your VA deal and ULSG [ph] deal? Ken Tanji : Yes. Hey Tracy, it\u2019s Ken. The VA deal, it\u2019s -- the 650 is about 13 RBC points and the 450 from the GUL deal is about 9 RBC points. So, that\u2019s the quantum expressed in RBC. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. Awesome. When I\u2019m thinking about these transactions and the counterparty credit risk, do you look at the size of capital by reinsurer, let\u2019s just put the ratings aside, like the Somerset Re capital base feels a little bit light. You did say there was over collateralization, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a comfort trust. What mechanisms do you put in place to reduce recapture risk? And if you could also share any assumptions at Somerset like with that deal? Ken Tanji : Sure, Tracy. It\u2019s Ken. A number of things there. So, let me cover them if I miss them, make sure I come back to them. But overall, we utilize reinsurance and our counterparties very carefully. We spread our reinsurance across a select group of high-quality third-party reinsurers. And as you would expect, we have standards for that reinsurance that we certainly applied to these transactions. While they\u2019re entering into the business, they do have experience, the management team of these reinsurers have a lot of industry experience and are committed to the business in the long term. But beyond that, we have contractual provisions, some of which you alluded to. But I also want to highlight that we\u2019ll be doing the administration of the business. So, we have complete control over that. And the reserves for the business in one instance will be in a comfort trust and the other to the structure, segregated account, but they provide similar assurances and protections. And again, will be over-collateralized with the procedures for timely settlement. We also -- I want to highlight that have investment guidelines for the investment portfolios for the investments that are held in these trusts or accounts. So overall, when we put that all together, we think the counterparty risk is well positioned for us. I think I covered your questions there, but hopefully, that helps. Tracy Benguigui : It definitely does. If I could just slip in, if there was any assumptions, like mortality or lapse rates that Somerset like looking at the deal? Ken Tanji : Yes. Obviously, those are their assumptions. Again, they have the people there on the other side with Somerset. They have a lot of experience, but they make their own assumptions. But also, they obviously are going to be subject to their own regulatory standards in the jurisdictions of which they operate. So, this got a lot of regulatory attention on both their side and our side. And we think that\u2019s also in good standing. Operator : Next question is coming from Mike Ward from Citi. Mike Ward : I really appreciate all the commentary around the de-risking and simplification. I\u2019m just curious, should we think about this as you guys are sort of saying you\u2019re open for considering more block deals or internal reinsurance restructure and whatnot? Or should we think about it as potentially more significant like a more material split or divestiture within the organization to unlock value? Charlie Lowrey : Hi. Mike, this is Charlie. I think it\u2019s really the former. In other words, if you think about what we\u2019re trying to do, if we take a step back and think about strategy of becoming a higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble company, this clearly falls as Caroline and I talked about in the first and second bucket. So we are de-risking and have de-risked and would consider further de-risking transactions if they made sense to stakeholders, but at the same time, using that as a way to pivot to becoming a higher-growth company. Mike Ward : That\u2019s very helpful. Maybe on Group Insurance, it hasn\u2019t gotten much airtime. Results were pretty favorable as they have been for peers. Just curious if there\u2019s any sort of updated kind of annual go-forward earnings power for Group now? Caroline Feeney : Yes. So Mike, it\u2019s Caroline, and I\u2019ll take your question. So certainly, I\u2019ll start by saying it was indeed a great quarter for Group Insurance. And as Charlie mentioned upfront, we saw record earnings and an overall benefit ratio of 81%. That reflects the execution of our strategy of product and segment diversification and our continued focus on profitability. Total disability new business premiums grew 24% year-to-date compared to the same period last year and our supplemental health business, a core component of our product diversification strategy also saw a strong double-digit growth. And our segment diversification strategy is focused on growing in the under 5,000 lives market. We\u2019ve got great momentum with that segment now comprising about a quarter of our block. We\u2019re also pleased to be achieving that diversification and growth without sacrificing profitability and pricing discipline. The current quarter also reflects favorable mortality experience in the working age population, driven primarily from lower incidents and the impact from positive rate actions on renewals. And also disability continued to see strong results as well. That was driven by lower incidents, strong employment numbers and our continued focus on effective claim management. The disability benefits ratio we saw was our second best reported ever trailing only last quarter. So, moving forward, Mike, we are confident in our Group business. We believe we\u2019re in a great position to continue executing on our strategy while continuing to grow in a disciplined and profitable manner. Because of this, you\u2019ll note that we\u2019ve already increased our expectations for core earnings going forward. Charlie Lowrey : Hey Mike, one other thing. It\u2019s Charlie. We talk a lot about the investments we\u2019re making in technology, processes, infrastructure and other things. And this is -- what\u2019s pleasing about this is, this is a tangible -- you can see a tangible outcome of some of the investments we\u2019re making, specifically in Group this time, but there are tangible outcomes we\u2019re beginning to see. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lowrey for any further or closing comments. Charlie Lowrey : All right. Thank you again for joining us today. We are making progress, transforming Prudential to deliver sustainable long-term growth and to meet the evolving needs of our customers. We are confident that our strategy and mutually reinforcing business mix will enable Prudential to become a leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. Thank you again, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Prudential's quarterly earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Bob McLaughlin. Please go ahead. Robert McLaughlin : Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today's call are Charlie Lowrey, Chairman and CEO; Bob Falzon, Vice Chairman and Head of International Businesses; and PGIM, our Global Investment Manager; Caroline Feeney, Head of U.S. Businesses; Ken Tanji, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. . We will start with prepared comments by Charlie, Rob and Ken, and then we will take your questions. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures.  For a reconciliation of such measures to the comparable GAAP measure and a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, please see the slides titled Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures in the appendix of today's presentation and the quarterly financial supplement, both of which can be found on our website at investor.prudential.com. And now I'll turn it over to Charlie. Charles Lowrey : Thank you, Bob, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our third quarter results reflect continued momentum across our businesses, excluding the benefits from strong sales and the fifth consecutive quarter of underlying earnings growth. We continue to execute on our strategy to become a higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble company. This quarter, we increased our capital efficiency and enhanced our capabilities in mutually reinforcing business system. We are also optimizing our operating model to drive both efficiency and growth. Our strategic progress and financial strength position us well to navigate the current macroeconomic environment and maintain a disciplined approach to capital deployment.  Turning to Slide 3. During the quarter, we launched Prismic, a life and annuity reinsurance company alongside Warburg Pincus and other investors. It is one of our most exciting opportunities to drive sustainable long-term growth across our investment management, insurance and retirement businesses. Through Prismic, we can ensure portions of our life and annuity in-force and new business to reduce market sensitivity, free up capital and invest in growth opportunities. Prismic can also offer its services to other insurance companies in need of reinsurance support, tapping into additional sources of third-party capital to drive further growth.  In addition, Prismic expands PGIM's assets under management. Prismic is a great example of how Prudential can unlock value for customers, shareholders and other stakeholders with our mutually reinforcing business system, which combines the power of our brand, global asset and liability origination capabilities and multichannel distribution. We're also growing and investing in our businesses to better serve our customers through both the products and services we offer and through the ways we do business. Our distribution channels continue to evolve and expand to provide more people around the world with our products and services in the way they want them. I'll provide a few examples from the third quarter. In Brazil, we achieved the second consecutive quarter of record sales, driven by continued expansion in the third-party distribution channel and the strong performance of our Life Planner channel.  In the U.S., individual retirement strategies posted its strongest sales quarter in 3 years, driven by the continued success of FlexGuard as well as the expansion of our fixed annuity suite with the launch of our new Wealth Guard multiyear guaranteed annuity. Within the Institutional market, retirement strategy secured $2.5 billion in new pension risk transfer transactions to the health savings account space by securing a $1.2 billion transaction with a top HSA provider, expanding our addressable market. And in our Prudential Advisors distribution channel, we announced a strategic relationship with LPL Financial, which upon completion in the latter part of next year, will enhance both our adviser and customer experience by leveraging LPL's expertise, industry-leading technology and robust broker dealer and registered investment adviser services.  Alongside these investments in our businesses, we continue to focus on customer service through enhanced sales and claims platforms. For example, this year, we have announced 7 customer experience technology partnerships within group insurance. These include Enrolofy, an innovative platform transforming the enrollment experience for millions of employees and Evolution IQ, an AI-driven platform that will streamline the disability claims process.  We're also working to create a leaner, faster and more agile company so that we can better meet the changing needs and expectations of our customers around the world while driving growth and efficiency to further strengthen our competitive position. We're taking new steps to simplify our organizational structure by reducing management layers, complexity and costs while making investments in technology and data platforms.  Our goal is to empower faster decision-making and bring our integrated business teams closer to our customers and clients. Turning now to Slide 4. Prudential's rock solid balance sheet and robust risk and capital management frameworks have allowed us to confidently navigate the current macroeconomic environment. Our AA financial strength is supported by our strong capital position, including approximately $48 billion of unrealized insurance margins, $4.3 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the third quarter and a high-quality, well-diversified investment portfolio and disciplined approach to asset liability management. Moving to Slide 5. Our disciplined approach to capital deployment, coupled with the added capital efficiency from the Prismic transaction enables us to effectively balance investing in the long-term growth of our businesses with returning capital to shareholders. In the third quarter, we returned over $700 million of capital to shareholders.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob. Robert Falzon : Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM U.S. and International businesses. I'll begin on Slide 6 with our financial results for the third quarter of 2023. Our pretax adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion $3.44 per share on an after-tax basis, up 45% from the year ago quarter. These results reflect underlying business growth, including the benefits from a higher interest rate environment, more favorable variable investment income and underwriting experience, partially offset by lower fee income. . Our GAAP net loss was $2.1 billion lower than our after-tax adjusted operating income, primarily driven by mark-to-market losses on interest rate derivatives due to the higher rates. Turning to the operating results from our businesses compared to the year ago quarter. PGIM, our global investment manager, had lower other related revenues driven by lower agency and seed and co-investment earnings and higher expenses.  Results of our U.S. businesses primarily reflected higher spread income, including more favorable variable investment income and lower expenses, partially offset by lower fee income and the increase in earnings in our International businesses primarily reflected higher spread income.  Turning to Slide 7. PGIM, our global active investment manager has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, equities and alternatives. PGIM's long-term investment performance remains attractive with 80% or more of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last 5- and 10-year periods.  In addition, our short-term performance continues to improve with 83% of assets exceeding their benchmarks over a 1-year period. PGIM experienced third-party net outflows of $5.7 billion in the quarter, Institutional outflows were primarily driven by lower than normal fixed income inflows and a large client outflow. Retail outflows were driven by sub-advised equity mandates.  As the investment engine of Prudential, the success and growth of PGIM end of our U.S. and International insurance and retirement businesses are mutually reinforcing. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise and access to institutional and other sources of private capital, including through the recently launched reinsurer of Prismic, our competitive advantage, helping our businesses bring enhanced solutions and create more value for our customers. Our insurance and retirement businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated net flows as well as unique access to insurance liabilities. In addition, we continue to grow both organically and through acquisitions, our private alternatives and credit business, which has assets of approximately $230 billion across private corporate and infrastructure credit real estate equity and debt and secondary private equity.  Capital deployment across PGIM's private assets platform of $8 billion during the quarter benefited from robust private placement and direct lending originations. Turning to Slide 8. Our U.S. businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income and benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to drive towards a higher value, higher growth and less market-sensitive mix of earnings, invest in our businesses to deliver best-in-class customer experiences and expand our addressable market with new financial solutions leveraging the capabilities across Prudential.  Retirement strategies generated strong sales of $6.7 billion in the third quarter across its institutional and individual lines of business. Our institutional retirement business has leading market capabilities, which helped to produce third quarter sales of $4.7 billion, including $2.5 billion of pension risk transfer transactions as well as strong stable value sales.  Individual Retirement posted $2 billion in sales, up 40% from the prior year quarter. Our product pivots have resulted in continued strong sales of FlexGuard and FlexGuard income, which represented about 2/3 of sales and fixed annuities that accounted for approximately 1/3 of sales this quarter. Our Individual Life sales increased 24% from the year ago quarter, reflecting our earlier product pivot strategy with variable life products representing approximately 73% of sales in the quarter, including the benefit from our recently launched FlexGuard Life product.  And in Group Insurance, we continue to execute on our strategy of product and client segment diversification while leveraging technology to increase operating efficiency and enhance the customer experience. Our strong results this quarter included favorable group life underwriting experience, which resulted in a benefit ratio of 82.4%.  Turning to Slide 9. Our International businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in targeted high-growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high-quality service and expanding our distribution and product offerings. Our needs-based approach and protection product focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs.  During the third quarter, we launched a new U.S. dollar indexed annuity product and Prudential of Japan was ranked as the #1 Japanese life insurer in the Forbes world best life insurance companies this year. We are proud to be recognized for the value we provide to our customers. In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a select portfolio of businesses in regions where our customer needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market-leading businesses and where the Prudential enterprise can add value. Our International business sales were up 19% compared to the year ago quarter. Life Planner sales were up 18%, driven by our second consecutive quarter of record sales in Brazil as well as higher sales in Japan.  Gibraltar sales were up 20%, primarily driven by growth in the bank channel. As we look ahead, we are well positioned to cross our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security. We continue to focus on investing in growth businesses and markets, delivering industry-leading customer experiences and creating the next generation of financial solutions to serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers.  And with that, I'll now turn it over to Ken. Kenneth Tanji : Thanks, Rob. I'll begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023 relative to our third quarter results. As noted, pretax adjusted operating income in the third quarter was $1.6 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $3.44 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense of how our fourth quarter results might develop we suggest adjustments for the following items : First, variable investment income was below expectations in the third quarter by $25 million. Second, we adjust underwriting experience by $10 million to normalize for third quarter experience. . And last, we include an adjustment of $350 million for expenses and other items. This includes elevated seasonal expenses and lower international earnings due to timing of seasonal premiums in the fourth quarter. In addition, as Charlie mentioned, we are implementing changes to our organizational structure as part of our continuous improvement process, and we have included an estimated restructuring charge of approximately $200 million that will be incurred in the fourth quarter.  We expect these actions will create operating efficiencies and provide reinvestment capacity to build capabilities. This will allow us to realize additional efficiencies, strengthen our competitiveness and fuel future growth. These adjustments combined get us to a baseline of $2.75 per share for the fourth quarter. I'll note that if you exclude items specific to the fourth quarter, earnings per share would be $3.48. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power continued to improve due to business growth, including the benefit of higher interest rates. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the fourth quarter.  Turning to Slide 11. Our capital position continues to support our AA financial strength rating. Our cash and liquid assets were $4.3 billion within our liquidity target range of $3 billion to $5 billion. Regulatory capital ratios are above our targets, and we have substantial off-balance sheet resources, including approximately $9 billion of contingent capital and liquidity facilities. We remain thoughtful in our capital deployment, balancing the preservation of financial strength and flexibility, investment in our businesses for long-term growth and shareholder distributions.  Turning to Slide 12 and in summary. We are transforming our business for sustainable growth. We continue to navigate the current macro environment with the financial strength of our rock solid balance sheet, and we are maintaining a balanced and disciplined approach to capital deployment. Now I'll turn it to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Thomas Gallagher : Just a couple of questions on capital. Did the GAAP net income loss you had this quarter also impacts statutory capital at all? And if so, did that require any contributions to subsidiaries or otherwise? Kenneth Tanji : Tom, it's Ken. Our GAAP results included the mark-to-market on interest rate hedges and a portion of that increased our negative IMR balance for stat. But our RBC ratios remain above our target and didn't require a capital contribution. Thomas Gallagher : Okay. And then the follow-up is when I think about the transition that lies ahead to ESR from SMR in Japan. Do you have enough clarity at this point to know how you should be positioned? Is it likely to consume capital, release capital? What do you think it should mean for Pru? Kenneth Tanji : Yes. Sure. First, let me start with our Japan businesses financial profile, which the businesses are high quality profitable, financially strong, generating earnings, strong earnings and have good solvency margin ratios under the current regime. The FSA is taking steps to implement new capital standards and that's underway with adoption still now a couple of years away.  But generally, we still believe our businesses are well capitalized, financially strong, and that would be evident under any reasonable capital standard. We also have ways to manage the outcomes we can reinsure business internally or externally to better match the economics of the business if we need to do that. And so we're -- it's something that we're looking at and working on. We're also advocating for reasonable and responsible standards and we'll have strategies to adapt to the new potential regime. Operator : Your next question is coming from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Ryan Krueger : My first question was on the restructuring charge. Can you talk a little bit about the potential economic benefits of that on a go-forward basis in terms of potential expense reduction? Charles Lowrey : Ryan, it's Charlie. Let me take that at a high level and provide you some context and then turn it over to Ken to specifically answer your question. But in terms of the restructuring program, we made good progress towards becoming a higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble company. . And if you think about what we've done, that's including releasing a significant amount of capital through the disposition of market-sensitive and/or low-growth businesses and products executing a series of programmatic acquisitions to expand our investment capabilities and growth potential. Launching Prismic, another arrow in our quiver, if you will, enhancing our mutual reinforcing business system and then exceeding our initial expense goal that we established a number of years ago.  But we've also said that we plan to continuously improve and build upon the progress we've made to further accelerate our vision and our growth objectives. We operate in an increasingly competitive environment. And in order to remain competitive and grow sales and earnings, we will continue to focus on further investing in our businesses and technology, reducing our cost of capital, enhancing the risk-adjusted returns we earn on our products and investments and transforming our operations to produce efficiencies while enhancing both our customer and employee experience.  So we're taking steps to create a leaner, faster and more agile company, including simplifying our management structure by reducing management layers, complexities and costs with the goal of bringing our integrated teams closer to our customers and our clients. We're also empowering our employees with faster decision-making in part through investments in technology and data platforms. And as we make progress in each of these areas, we'll update you as we have in the past. So with that as context, Ken, let me turn it over to you to answer the specific question Ryan had. Kenneth Tanji : Yes. So I think, Ryan, we expect, as you just heard from Charlie, a number of benefits in the way we're transforming but also financially, the restructuring will result in annual cost savings that will be greater than the restructuring charge of $200 million. And those savings will provide expense capacity to invest in capabilities and gain further efficiencies sort of, as Charlie described there to help offset inflation and also to grow our businesses. And the way we think when we put that all together is we'll be keeping expenses flat over the near term. . And that's, again, how we think of things holistically, not just the saves but also combined with the investments in growing our businesses while keeping operating expenses flat and improving margins. And that's the continuous improvement mindset that we're striving for. Ryan Krueger : And then a question on Prismic, you launched it with $1 billion of capital. I assume that the structured settlements transaction consumed a good amount of that. Can you give us any color on how much committed capital that you have already in place for future growth? Robert Axel : Ryan, Rob, maybe let me give a perspective about that. If you're asking that from the perspective of sort of the Prismic standpoint in terms of the appetite there. A couple of thoughts. One is, as Charlie actually indicated in opening remarks, we see very interesting opportunities, growth opportunities that are at the intersection of asset management and insurance, and we expect Prismic to play a material role in executing against that. And we think the benefit of that is it's going to actually accelerate growth across all of our businesses. . And in the course of doing so, actually helped to shift the business mix so that it's higher growth, less market-sensitive and more highly valued at the end of the day. With respect to Prismic itself, I think what we've articulated before is that we and our investors share operations that go well beyond the initial $10 billion structured settlement transaction. So we anticipate that, that will include opportunities to further optimize our balance sheet. It's going to include what's closed. So the reserve and capital financing for our new sales across our businesses and importantly, third-party blocks that will be -- we're looking to reinsure into Prismic as well. Operator : Next question is coming from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler. John Barnidge : Great. Appreciate the opportunity. The restructuring program, you talked about a portion being there to invest. Can you talk about human capital versus automation and then the offshoring opportunity as well? Charles Lowrey : Sure. It's Charlie again. As part of the continuous improvement process, we'll be simplifying our operating model and organizational structure, as you said, really streamlining decision-making to create a leaner, faster and more agile company so we can better meet the needs -- better meet the needs of our customers while driving growth and efficiency. So we are far more focused on optimizing organizational structure through organizational design and investments in technology as opposed to offshoring. That is the predominant direction in which we're going. . John Barnidge : Fantastic. And my follow-up question, can you maybe talk about M&A interest? Do you have what you need to grow organically from a product perspective? And is there opportunities for PGIM to get larger insurances? Charles Lowrey : Yes. It's Charlie again. Let me take that. We've done many acquisitions that have significantly grown the company over time. And these acquisitions include companies of various sizes as well as teams of specialists. And programmatic M&A, to your point, will continue to play a role as we think about the development of the -- of what we want to do going forward and a series of well-executed programmatic M&A transactions will become material over time. As a result, we continue to look at a variety of opportunities and different sizes. . But we're continuing to be thoughtful about the deployment of capital, especially in light of the current macroeconomic conditions. And our M&A interest continue to be focused on mature companies that support our strategy of growing PGIM and emerging markets by which we can expand our capabilities or our distribution and continue to increase the scale of our existing businesses. But regardless of size, we're going to be thoughtful about evaluating the strategic and the financial merits of each transaction. Andrew Sullivan : John, it's Andy. Maybe I'll just add in because you asked about PGIM we're going to continue to work to globalize the business. And as we've talked about before, focus on higher growth, higher fee areas. So you should think about private alternatives and real asset capabilities. Operator : Next question is coming from Wes Carmichael from Wells Fargo. Wesley Carmichael : I had a question on RBC. I think your slide showed that PICA's RBC ratio is in excess of 3.75. I just wanted to confirm, is the benefit of negative IMR within that RBC ratio? And could you maybe just size that for us? Kenneth Tanji : Yes, sure. It's Ken. Yes, that -- the benefit of admitting the negative IMR as part of the new standard is -- has been adopted and is in effect for our third quarter results. We were able to admit $1.3 billion, which is at the cap level relative to our surplus, so that is already reflected in there. Wesley Carmichael : And maybe just a follow-up on an earlier question on Japan and ESR. Could you maybe just help us understand how your USD-denominated products are proposed to be treated under ESR versus the current SMR framework? Robert Falzon : It's Wes. Let me take that question. The -- first of all, this is a regulatory framework that's still in development, and I want to emphasize that. It's a regulatory framework that to date has been based on the international, the ICS capital standards that have been developed, and those standards are actually not -- don't necessarily reflect the underlying economics of more iteration product, particularly in the U.S.  So we continue to work on the international front on the ICS, and we continue to work with Japan as well in terms of how that ultimately gets reflected into their regime, whether it's modified at the international level or not. But what we found is one of the coming of the current set of proposals is that they don't quite get the economics right when you get into the -- the types of long duration products that are typically sold in the U.S., both on the life side and on the retirement side.  So that's an area where industry continues to work with the regulators and we're hopeful of making progress there. As Ken mentioned earlier, to the extent that's challenged any way that we do have alternatives that are available to us to think about how we would then manage that product on a go-forward basis. There's a strong demand for the products in the Japan marketplace. So for Japanese consumers like the U.S. dollar-denominated products. And so the industry will want to continue to sell those products in the marketplace, and we'll come up with solutions for being able to do that and be able to finance that on an economic basis. . Andrew Sullivan : This is Andy. I was just going to add in. We have a lot of ability and flexibility to navigate those changes that are coming at us. We obviously have incredibly strong distribution, both captive and third party. We have a very wide product portfolio from both a yen and U.S. dollar perspective and single premium and recurring premium and we've been very successful at delivering a top-notch, great customer experience that we've been recognized for. So the strength of that business complex will really enable us to navigate the changes that are coming down the road. Operator : Next question is coming from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Jimmy Bhullar : First a question on PGIM flows. If you could just talk about what drove the negative flows in both retail and institutional funds? And to what extent do you think it's a function of just industry-wide issues that asset managers are seeing versus maybe the slight dip that you saw in your performance? And then relatedly, the impact on fees, should it be considered to the assets? Or are the fees lower or higher on the assets that you've lost? Andrew Sullivan : So Jimmy, it's Andy. I'll take your question. So this quarter, we experienced third-party outflows of $5.7 billion. On the retail end, outflows were $1.9 billion. That was predominantly an equity story. We've seen clients rebound for a variety of reasons, including to recognize gains as the funds have performed well. We have produced strong equity performance with 89% of our equity asset performing benchmark in the last year. On institutional side, outflows were $3.8 billion. Net outflows were primarily fixed income. We are seeing a lower level of gross inflows into this asset class. Investors are hesitant to come back in until it's clear rates have stabilized. We also saw 1 large low fee rate mandate lapse in institutional. As to your question, industry or specific, these are consistent with the industry. And in particular, the fixed income headwinds are consistent. As far as our outlook looking forward, a stable higher rate environment will be good for our flow. So we know that once rates stabilize, we expect to benefit flow-wise. Your question around fees, obviously, it depends very much on the mix of assets, but we're being very successful in bringing inflows into higher fee rate strategies, in particular, into the private alts areas of our business. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. And then on Individual Life, that's a business where the results have been weak the past several quarters, but this quarter was actually a good quarter. I think you mentioned in the presentation, there's a benefit from lower expenses and a legal reserve release. Can you quantify how much each was so that one gets an idea on sort of the underlying earnings in the business? And what your outlook is for individual Life earnings? . Caroline Feeney : Yes. So Jimmy, it's Caroline, and I'll take your question. So as you mentioned, this quarter, Individual Life did see favorable expense experience and that includes a number of onetime items, but it also, as you mentioned, does include the release of a legal reserve.  So Jimmy, it's our practice to regularly review our legal reserves and then make appropriate adjustments reflecting activity within the quarter. And the release this quarter reflects the results of that review. In terms of the outlook for life overall, I would say, in addition to what you saw in favorable expenses on the life side, we also saw strong investment results and also underwriting results that were largely aligned to our expectations and overall fundamentals of the business continue to remain very solid, and we're very optimistic about the growth there. Jimmy Bhullar : And just any color on the size of the legal reserve because that I view that more as sort of a onetime versus expenses tend to move around. . Caroline Feeney : Jimmy, I would not comment on the specific size of a particular legal reserve, as I said. We saw favorable expenses overall and part of that was the release of a league overserved, but we do not comment on the specific size of a case. Operator : Next question is coming from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Tracy Benguigui : I know it's early, but I was wondering if you could just share your thoughts on DOL and the impact on your FIA business. Caroline Feeney : Sure, Tracy, it's Caroline, and I'll take your question. So I'll first start off by saying, Tracy, we've been a long-time support of regulations that provide consumer protections while ensuring that all Americans continue to have access to quality advice and the solutions they need for a secure retirement.  So the proposal was just released 2 days ago, and so we're very much still in the midst of thoroughly reviewing and analyzing it so we can assess any potential impact on our customers and specifically their ability to access critical retirement products. And you specifically strike you about. So we do realize that in the proposal, there appears to be a focus on fixed indexed annuities, which today, for us, accounts for less than 20% of our total annuity sales, but are also part of a well diversified suite of annuity solutions as we continue to focus on delivering valuable solutions to help our customers meet their retirement savings needs -- that being said, I will just reiterate that we're still in the process of reviewing the proposed rule. And finally, I'll just add that under the last proposed rule change, we implemented policies and procedures to comply with the final prohibited transaction exemption in a timely fashion, and we'd expect to do the same here. Tracy Benguigui : Do you think that evolution also took place in the IMO channel or they could comply with new standards? . Caroline Feeney : I'm sorry, Tracy, I want to make sure I heard your question. Tracy Benguigui : The IMO channel independent agents Yes, would they also be well equipped since the last proposal? Caroline Feeney : So what I could improve on Yes. So Tracy, what I couldn't comment on is others in terms of their IMO channels and whether they'd be prepared or not. What I will say, particularly, and I'll just reiterate with the last DOL-proposed rule, we were very much ready as an entire enterprise across all of the various businesses where there was any impact, and we are ready to comply with the rule. And as I mentioned, we would expect to do the same here. That would include all of the distribution channels that would, in any way, be impacted by the new proposed rule. Tracy Benguigui : Got it. I want to touch on Prismic and thinking about the investor consortium. Could you let me know like what they're thinking in terms of an investment time horizon? Will there be like a call option being arbitrary here but, let's say, like in 10 years, would prune to provide liquidity to those investors after a set period of time? Or do you envision raising new funds? Robert Falzon : Tracy, it's Rob. So we're partnering with a group of very large global institutional investors. Their intent is to operate with scale. And their investment horizon very much aligned with our own is quite long term. Prismic itself has an independent Board of Directors, and that will govern the route toward growth and otherwise. But there are no put or call provisions embedded in the agreement that we've got with Prismic. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is coming from Wilma Burdis from Raymond James. Wilma Burdis : A couple of earnings-related questions. First, I think you guys previously cited $65 million of deal closing costs with Somerset Re. I just want to know if that would lower the 275 baseline for 4Q? Or maybe just an update on timing there? And then the other is, if you could walk us through the trajectory of benefits from the restructuring. Will we see a benefit in 1Q? Or is it going to take a little bit longer? Kenneth Tanji : Yes. It's Ken. The deal-related costs for the reinsurance with Summerset Re will be incurred at the time of closing, and those have not been included in the baseline. And I'm sorry. And obviously, I think your second part of the question was the benefits of the restructuring or the benefits of the reinsurance will occur subsequent to close, obviously. . Wilma Burdis : Yes, the restructuring, should we start to see some benefits coming in 1Q? Or is it going to take some time? Kenneth Tanji : Are you say the organizational restructuring, is that what you're referring to or the reinsurer. I'm sorry. We will see benefits in 2020 for pretty soon thereafter, there will be a portion that's highly -- that's effective in the first quarter and then thereafter. Wilma Burdis : And could you talk about the impact of Prismic on Pages RBC -- just -- I know there was a little bit of a holdco liquidity impact from the initial investments. So could you just talk about that aspect as well? Kenneth Tanji : Sure. The initial impact of the reinsurance of the structured settlement the Prismic was modest, and that was impact -- that was in our RBC ratio for September. And so we had the impact of the initial portion of that. But over time, it will also enable capital benefits as we reallocate the retained investment portfolio. And so it will -- we had some impact immediately, but they also will have continued impact as we reallocate the investment portfolio. Operator : Next question today is coming from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies. Suneet Kamath : Great. I wanted to go to Prismic again. Charlie, I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about further optimization of your in-force block. And I think you specifically referred to life and annuity blocks. Is that sort of the extent to where we should be thinking about in terms of where you'd optimize? I guess where I'm going with this is there an opportunity for something like a long-term care in terms of your in-force and reinsuring that to Prismic? Charles Lowrey : Sure. Let me take a step back and just tell you generally how we're thinking about this. This makes really an example of our open architecture solutions and is a very important additional component of our strategy to become a higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble company. We formed Prismic with Warburg Pincus and other global investors because we see significant opportunities that exist at the intersection, as Rob said, of asset management and insurance.  And we're perfectly positioned to take advantage of those opportunities in the business which we have. And we're excited about our ability to leverage third-party capital and reinsurance to drive the incremental growth in our insurance, retirement and asset management businesses. And Prismic, to get, to your point, really reinforces and enhances our mutually reinforcing business system in 3 ways. First, we can reinsure portions of our in-force business like the structural settlements transaction we just completed and have PGIM continue to manage the majority of assets locking up capital to become less market sensitive. And to your point, we'll look to our retirement and life businesses for those assets.  Secondly, we can write new business that could be reinsured to Prismic, so forward flow. And since Prismic is mainly supported by third-party capital, we can write additional retirement and insurance business to further accelerate our growth and at the same time, increase PGIM's assets under management.  And finally, Prismic can reinsure third-party blocks, which would again increased PGIM's AUM. So there's a lot of potential we see for Prismic, and we're being thoughtful about how we execute against these opportunities and have recently reallocated resources to further optimize and cap our will further optimize our capabilities since Prismic is such an important component of our mutually reinforcing business system. So it's going to be in the life and retirement businesses mainly that we think about reinsuring other blocks, but we could think about others as we go forward. Robert Falzon : Suneet, it's Robert. I'd sort of add as sort of a general market observation to Charlie's remarks is that we've seen investors that are behind many of the reinsurance vehicles in partnership and otherwise, having an increasingly higher appetite for a variety of different products. So this started out very much if you look at the early reinsurance transactions in the sort of very vanilla insurance space and in the very vanilla annuity space of fixed annuities. And over time, what you've seen on our own transactions as well as others is that now is expanded into variable annuities. It's expanded into GUL, and we do see that that's a trend that's likely to continue. There's a robust appetite and that appetite as it gets -- as investors get more comfortable with the dynamics of the insurance marketplace and business model that their appetite will continue to grow. So we see interesting opportunities, both domestically and importantly internationally as well. Suneet Kamath : Okay. Got it. And then I guess on the VA deal, the proceeds from that transaction still in PICA and is the expectation that they'll just sort of stay there and be used to support organic growth? Or would you expect to take those proceeds up to holdco for other uses? Kenneth Tanji : Yes, it's Ken. So the reinsurance of our variable annuity block closed in April. And so we had the benefit of that effective April 1, and it is one of the considerations we made as we looked at our RBC and our dividend capacity and factored into the dividends that we made in the third quarter, which was $1 billion from PICA.  So we did get the benefit. It's one of the things we thought about when we looked at the overall level of our RBC and then decided to make a dividend to PICA of $1 billion in the third quarter. Suneet Kamath : Sorry, dividend out of PICA. Kenneth Tanji : Yes, I'm sorry, yes. Suneet Kamath : So just a quick follow-up there. I was just trying to track the holdco cash because it looked like it went down a little bit sequentially. Can you just kind of give us some of the bigger moving pieces there? Kenneth Tanji : Sure. Yes. The bigger moving pieces, like I just mentioned, was the $1 billion that the holding company received from PICA as a dividend. And then we also made a $200 million investment in Prismic and then the other would be ordinary course, interest expense and shareholder distributions. And those are the main components that led to a very small change in our HLA. Operator : Your next question is coming from Michael Ward from Citi. Michael Ward : Another one on Prismic. But for the third-party component and the mechanics, if PGIM could get the AUM of new blocks being reinsured, wouldn't the general account of the external blocks go on your balance sheet? Because I wouldn't have thought that you're targeting exposure to third-party capital intensive business. Robert Falzon : Mike, it's Rob. So yes, PGIM will have an appetite for doing both flow and balance sheet from Prudential as well as third parties. We will look to put -- and yes, we will get the asset management on those blocks as they're brought into Prismic. So that's part of the arrangement that we have with Prismic. And then separately, we'll make a decision as to how much we invest in Prismic on a go-forward basis. . As of now, our ownership in Prismic is at a 20% level. It's not a contractual application for us to stay at that level. But having said that, we think that the returns that we get for a capital that could be deployed through Prismic when you think about the returns on the underlying blocks enhanced by the fees that we get from from our asset management business could be quite attractive on a risk-reward basis.  And so we would have some appetite for continuing to invest in those sorts of business when they significantly enhance the fee components that we get out of that business, which on an overall basis with a reduced risk profile of the earnings stream on a go forward. Michael Ward : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe one thing we didn't touch on CRE, commercial real estate. Any developments for you guys in the office area? Robert Falzon : No, I would say that -- it's Rob again. Sorry, Mike, that nothing material to update you on from last quarter. We have a very high-quality overall real estate portfolio, including the office components to that or component of that. And we continue to see resiliency within that portfolio, as you would expect, given the experience that we have there, the dedicated team that we have from an underwriting standpoint and the quality of the overall portfolio. So while on the -- from a valuation standpoint, but updating our valuations and the valuations of the collateral supporting office loans continues to come down, but our LTV still remain quite low on a relative basis, and we feel very comfortable with the overall portfolio exposure there. Operator : Our next question is a follow-up from Wes Carmichael from Wells Fargo. Wesley Carmichael : Just had a couple of earnings ones should be quick. But on the baseline for Q4, the $2.75 that includes normal variable investment income. So I was just hoping if you could help us with your outlook in the near term. It's a pretty modest headwind in the third quarter, but just wondering if you expect that to be a bit challenged going forward. Robert Falzon : See, from a VII standpoint, Wes, it's Rob. I think about that as having 2 components to it. One is the returns that we get from our alternatives portfolio and the second being the level of prepayment income that we get from the fixed income portfolio. I think we've guided to the fact that we expect lower levels of prepayment income on a go-forward basis. That was the primary contributor to the below expectations in the current quarter.  So I think you should expect to see that. On a go-forward basis, we generally don't provide an outlook. What I would say is that as even the current quarter, we have a good portfolio that's very well diversified. And so while there are different components of it that performed up and down in the current quarter, we would expect that to continue in future quarters as well. In this particular quarter, real estate performance was off, as you would expect.  But actually, our private equity portfolio performed quite well. And just to be very clear, within our private equity portfolio, we have a very small exposure to sort of the DC area. So it's more core private equity. And even within that, it's a fairly significant component of that that's in high yield and debt strategies. And so that sort of caused some stabilization within that private equity portfolio.  So I think that we will vary as markets do, but we continue to believe that we'll perform on a relevant basis quite well. Wesley Carmichael : Got it. And then on PGIM, I think you lowered your expected range for other related revenues by about $10 million on a quarterly basis. Just curious if you can provide us some color on what's driving that there. Andrew Sullivan : Yes, Wes, it's Andy. I'll take your question. So ORR came in at the quarter at $37 million. It was predominantly driven by the real estate space. So this is a pretty consistent story. That's been the last few quarters.  Our agency earning decline from the real estate slowdown, and we saw lower real estate valuations and transactions. As far as the go-forward look, you are correct. We now expect our ORR to average about $40 million per quarter. That lower run rate, again, is flowing directly from the slowdown in the real estate markets. we're expecting to see lower agency earnings as well as lower private incentive fees. And while this will vary quarter-to-quarter as always, we expect the patterns that we've been seeing to be more muted in this environment. Operator : We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lowrey for any further closing comments. Charles Lowrey : Okay. Thank you again for joining us today. We're entering into the next chapter of our evolution with a unique business model and growth strategy that positions Prudential to help current and future generation secure financial future. We are confident that our strategy and mutually reimbursing business model will enable Prudential to be a global leader in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security. Thank you again, and stay well. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Later, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Bob McLaughlin. Please go ahead. Robert McLaughlin : Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today's call are Charlie Lowrey, Chairman and CEO; Rob Falzon, Vice Chairman; Andy Sullivan, Head of International Businesses; and PGIM, our global investment manager; Caroline Feeney, Head of US Businesses; Ken Tanji, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by Charlie, Rob and Ken, and then we will take your questions. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from those predictions we make today. In addition, this presentation may include references to non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of such measures to the comparable GAAP measure and a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Please see the slides titled Forward-Looking Statements and non-GAAP Measures in the appendix to today's presentation and the quarterly financial supplement, both of which can be found on our website at investor.prudential.com. Now, I'll turn it over to Charlie. Charles Lowrey : Thank you, Bob, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Before we begin, I'd like to comment on our CFO transition. As you saw from yesterday's news release, Yanela Frias, President of Prudential's Group Insurance Business has been named Executive Vice President and CFO of Prudential, succeeding Ken Tanji, has a 27-year veteran of Prudential. Yanela is a seasoned executive who brings a deep understanding of our business and industry, as well as significant finance, operations and leadership experience. I'm sure you'll enjoy getting to know her as she starts her new role. Yanela will become CFO effective March 15, and Ken will stay on for a six-month period to ensure a smooth transition. Ken has been a great partner and friend and has had a distinguished 35-year career at Prudential. I don't need to go back far to articulate his impact. Most recently, as CFO, Ken guided Prudential through the financial challenges of the COVID pandemic and the market volatility that followed. During the same time, his leadership on strategic initiatives meaningfully contributed to our goals of becoming less market-sensitive and more nimble. We are grateful to Ken for his many contributions over more than three decades and wish him well. Now, let's turn to my remarks for the quarter. Our financial results for 2023 reflect continued strong sales momentum across our insurance and retirement businesses and solid underlying earnings growth. The fourth quarter capped a productive year of continued transformation to make Prudential a higher growth, more capital-efficient and more nimble company. Our strategic progress and financial strength position us well to navigate the current macroeconomic environment, maintain a disciplined approach to capital deployment and deliver long-term sustainable growth. Turning to Slide 3. I will begin today by sharing a few examples of how we are transforming our business to drive future growth and unlock value for all our stakeholders. Over the course of 2023, we executed several attractive transactions adding to our capital efficiency. We reinsure the $10 billion block of traditional variable annuities, reducing our market sensitivity. We closed a $10 billion transaction of structured settlement annuities with Prismic, a life and annuity reinsurance company we launched. Prismic will enhance our mutually reinforcing business system and drive future growth by leveraging our differentiated brands, global asset and liability origination capabilities and multichannel distribution. In addition, we entered into a reinsurance agreement with Somerset Re for a $12.5 billion block of guaranteed universal life reserves, which will release capital and increase earnings. We continue to strengthen the capabilities of our market-leading businesses through strategic M&A, expanded distribution channels and created new products and solutions to meet the evolving needs of our customers across the globe and to support future growth. In PGIM, we enhanced our capabilities in the attractive area of private credit and direct lending by acquiring a majority stake in Dearpath Capital, which closed in December. To further provide investors with a cohesive offering, we brought together PGIM's private alternatives capabilities into one global team with the formation of PGIM private alternatives. Internationally, we continue to expand third-party distribution in Latin America through Mercado Libre, reaching a milestone of close to 300,000 policies in force last quarter. In Japan, we launched expanded inheritance and new investment products to diversify our portfolio and meet a broader range of customer needs. Our Institutional Retirement Strategies business secured its second largest longevity risk transfer transaction ever with one of the biggest life insurance companies in the Netherlands. This marks our first international reinsurance deal in the Dutch market. Retirement strategies also worked with Fidelity Investments to address growing consumer demand for a workplace retirement income solution. Our Prudential Simply Income product, a new single premium immediate annuity is now available to employer-based retirement plans administered by Fidelity. In addition, to solidify our leadership and expand our addressable market and structured settlements, we launched a new index structured settlement annuity product. We also continue to create a more nimble and efficient company to meet the changing needs of our customers and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace. This included evolving our operating model and organizational structure to better support customers at the business level and leveraging technology to bring products to market faster. Our business and technology teams together launched an average of one new or enhanced product every two weeks in 2023. Additionally, we are strategically leaning into partnerships with cutting-edge technology firms within our group business to increase the speed of innovation, add capabilities and enhance customer experience. We entered 2024 with momentum and optimism as we have expanded and diversified our product offerings, enhanced customer and client experiences and continued to reinvest in our businesses for sustainable long-term growth. Moving to Slide 4. Our transformation strategy and growth initiatives are supported by Prudential's rock solid balance sheet and robust risk and capital management framework, which have allowed us to confidently navigate the macroeconomic environment. Our AA rated financial strength, includes a strong capital position, including approximately $50 billion of unrealized insurance margins, $4.1 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the fourth quarter, and a high-quality, well-diversified investment portfolio and disciplined approach to asset liability management. Turning to Slide 5, our disciplined approach to capital deployment enables us to effectively balance investing in the long-term growth of our businesses with returning capital to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we returned over $700 million of capital to shareholders.  For 2024, our board has authorized up to $1 billion in share repurchases as well as a 4% dividend increase beginning in the first quarter. This represents our 16th consecutive annual dividend increase.  And now I will turn it over to Rob. Robert Falzon : Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, US and International businesses. I'll begin on Slide 6 with our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. Our pre-tax adjusted operating income was $5.5 billion or $11.62 per share for 2023 and $1.3 billion or $2.58 per share in the fourth quarter. These results reflect an increase in the underlying earnings power of our businesses, including the benefits of strong sales growth and higher interest rates. This was partially offset by pressure on variable investment income and higher expenses, primarily due to a $200 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter. Our GAAP net income for the quarter was $374 million higher than our after-tax AOI primarily driven by net investment gains due to declining rates. Turning to the quarterly operating results of our businesses compared to the year ago quarter. PGIM, our global investment manager, had lower other related revenues driven by lower incentive fees and agency income and higher expenses. This was partially offset by higher asset management fees, including the benefits from our acquisition of Deerpath Capital and of launching Prismic. Results of our US businesses primarily reflected higher spread income driven by business growth and the benefit of higher interest rates and lower expenses. This was partially offset by lower legacy traditional variable annuity fee income as we pivot to less market-sensitive products. The earnings in our international businesses primarily reflected less favorable underwriting results, including unfavorable policyholder behavior partially offset by lower expenses. Turning to Slide 7, PGIM, our global active investment manager, has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, equities and alternatives. PGIM's strong investment performance over the past year has also driven attractive long-term performance with over 80% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last five- and 10-year periods. PGIM's assets under management increased 6% to $1.3 trillion from the year ago quarter, primarily resulting from market appreciation. Third-party net outflows in the fourth quarter totaled $13.5 billion. Institutional outflows of $6.3 billion were driven primarily by a large redemption of a low fee equity index mandate and redemptions in public fixed income resulting from client rebalancing and liquidity needs. Retail outflows of $7.2 billion were primarily driven by equity, sub-advised mandates and fixed income outflows. As the investment engine of Prudential, the success and growth of PGIM and of our US and International insurance and Retirement businesses are mutually reinforcing. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise and access to institutional and other sources of private capital, including through the recently launched reinsurer Prismic or a competitive advantage, helping our businesses to bring enhanced solutions and create more value for our customers. Our insurance and retirement businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated net flows as well as unique access to insurance liabilities. In addition, we continue to grow both organically and through acquisitions, our PGIM Private Alternatives business, which has assets of approximately $240 billion across private, corporate and infrastructure credit, real estate equity and debt and secondary private equity. Capital deployment across PGIM's private assets platform of $9 billion during the quarter benefited from robust private placement and direct lending originations. Turning to Slide 8, our US businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income and benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to drive growth by transforming our capabilities to improve customer experiences and expanding our addressable market with new financial solutions leveraging the capabilities across Prudential. Retirement strategies generated strong sales of $16.4 billion in the fourth quarter across its institutional and individual lines of business. Institutional Retirement sales of $14.3 billion in the fourth quarter were driven by strong international reinsurance sales and our best quarter for structured settlements since 2016. International Reinsurance sales included a $9.2 billion transaction in the Netherlands and with the recently passed Dutch Pension Reform Legislation, we anticipate this market will continue to grow over time. Individual Retirement posted $2.1 billion in sales, reaching the highest level since the third quarter of 2019. Our product pivots have resulted in continued strong sales of FlexGuard and FlexGuard Income, which increased about 20% from the year ago quarter, while fixed annuity sales have doubled. Our Individual Life sales increased 33% from the year ago quarter, reflecting our product pivot strategy towards more capital-efficient products. Variable life protection and accumulation products represented approximately 70% of sales for the year, including a benefit from our recently launched FlexGuard Life product. In group Insurance, we continue to execute on our strategy of product and client segment diversification while leveraging technology to increase operating efficiency and enhance the customer experience. Our full year sales were up 11% compared to the prior year, driven by growth in disability and supplemental health. Group's full year adjusted operating income was the highest in the past 15 years and included favorable underwriting experience. As a result, we are lowering our benefits ratio target range by 2 percentage points to 83% to 87%. Turning to Slide 9, our international businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in targeted high-growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high-quality service and expanding our distribution and product offerings. Our needs-based approach and protection product focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a selective portfolio of businesses in regions where customer needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market-leading businesses and where the Prudential enterprise can add value. Sales in our international businesses were up 24% compared to the year ago quarter. Life Planner sales were up 21%, including the benefits of recent product launches in Japan to diversify our product offering. In addition, Brazil sales were up 24%, reflecting growth across all channels and leading to a full year record. Gibraltar sales were up 27%, primarily driven by higher independent agency sales and growth in the bank channel. As we look ahead, we are well positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We continue to focus on investing in growth businesses and markets, delivering industry-leading customer experiences and creating the next generation of financial solutions to serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. And with that, I'll now hand it over to Ken. Kenneth Tanji : Thanks Rob. I'll begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the first quarter of 2024 relative to our fourth quarter results. As noted, pre-tax adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter was $1.3 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.58 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense for how our first quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items; first, variable investment income was below expectations in the fourth quarter by $95 million. Second, underwriting experience was below expectations by $15 million in the fourth quarter, and we expect $30 million of unfavorable seasonality in the first quarter. And last, we included an adjustment of $240 million for expenses and other items. This includes the $200 million restructuring charge related to changes in our organizational structure as well as adjustments for typical seasonality related to the timing of expenses and premium. These adjustments combined get us to a baseline of $3.36 per share for the first quarter. I'll note that if we exclude items specific to the first quarter, earnings per share would be $3.50. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power has increased significantly over the past year, while we have also made strategic progress improving our risk profile. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the first quarter. As we look forward, we have included other considerations for 2024 in the appendix. Turning to Slide 11. Our capital position continues to support our AA financial strength rating. Our regulatory capital ratios are above our targets, and we expect PICA's year-end RBC ratio to be greater than 425%. Our cash and liquid assets were $4.1 billion within our liquidity target range of $3 billion to $5 billion, and we have substantial off-balance sheet resources. We remain thoughtful in our capital deployment, balancing the preservation of financial strength and flexibility, investment in our businesses for long-term growth and shareholder distributions. Turning to Slide 12, and in summary, we are transforming our business for sustainable growth. We continue to confidently navigate the macro environment with the financial strength of our rock-solid balance sheet, and we are maintaining a balanced and disciplined approach to capital deployment. Now, I'll turn it to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. Tom Gallagher : Good morning, and Ken, good luck. Just looking at the 65% free cash flow conversion, I know that bullet was removed from the capital slides. I just want to make sure that, that's still the target? And then relatedly, when thinking about Japan economic solvency implementation, can you comment on how you see that impacting sources and uses of capital and capital generation over the next few years? Thanks. Kenneth Tanji : Yes. Hey, Tom, it's Ken and thanks for the good luck. I appreciate it. We didn't remove that comment. I think it's pretty well understood that our free cash flow ratio has been about 65% over time and that's reflective of our business mix and our growth. It's going to vary period-to-period, but it will be about -- it's been about 65% on average. And we think that's reflective of our approach to balance growth with sustainable and diversified sources of cash flow. Actually, in2023, you'll see that cash flows were actually higher than that for a variety of reasons, so no change there. In terms of ESR in Japan, again, we believe our businesses in Japan are well capitalized and financially strong. And that would be evident in any reasonable capital standard. We're certainly working with the FSA, advocating for reasonable and responsible standards, but we also have strategies to adapt to that new regime as well. We could reinsure business internally, to the US or Bermuda, we could reinsure externally. So we have a number of strategies to manage in the new regime. And that's something that we're working on. Tom Gallagher : Got you. Thanks. And then just a follow-up, if I could. The strength in Japan and International sales more broadly, I thought was kind of notable in the quarter. Can you comment on the competition in those markets what's driving the stronger sales? And do you think that's going to translate into stronger top line? Because I know it's been sort of flattish, but do you expect that to inflect at all in 2024 or 2025? Andrew Sullivan : So, Tom, its Andy. I'll take your question. And thank you for noting that. You've heard me say this before. Sales are an outcome of strong brand, great product and outstanding distribution we feel that we clearly have a competitive advantage in those areas, particularly as it relates to Japan and Brazil. As you heard from Rob, we are very pleased that our sales were up 24% year-over-year, up 21% in Life Planner and 27% in Gibraltar. Once again, that success was very broad-based as we saw growth in every channel in Brazil and across life planners, independent agents and the bank channel in Japan. In Japan, we continue to see lift from higher sales of our US dollar product, really supported by the higher US interest rate. But also clearly, our work on, innovating our product designs and enhancing our customer experience, in particular, in digital is paying off. If you look at Brazil and the results there, we saw double-digit year-over-year growth in every channel. Our Life Planner channel outperformed throughout all of last year with high Life Planner retention and strong productivity. On top of that, we continue to expand and strengthen our third-party distribution. Once again, we saw really strong results flowing from Itau Bank. And we also remain quite pleased that the expansion of our partnership with Mercado Libre. So, you asked about the outlook. As always, our priority is going to be to deliver strong value to our customers, while achieving healthy levels of profitability, but we are optimistic about our ability to grow both the top and bottom-line of our business. Tom Gallagher : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Your line is now live. Ryan Krueger : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. First, can you provide some more color on the key drivers of the RBC ratio improvement in the quarter? I know you had given us the exact RBC during the year, but it seems like it increased a fair amount in the quarter. Kenneth Tanji : Yes. Hey Ryan, it's Ken. Just to remind people, RBC is something that is reported annually. And so the greater than 25% is where we believe RBC will be at the end of the year. But again, that will be filed in much greater detail, at the end of the month. And so yes, we did have an improvement in our RBC ratio in 2023, and it's really a combination of a few things. One, our in-force businesses are generating free surplus, that's part of it. We had the benefit of admitting negative IMR with the regulatory change that was adopted during the year. We also had a reduction in our AAT reserves, generally from reaggregation of policies and investment portfolios, which created some efficiency. So it was a combination of that. And so overall, our capital position and flexibility has improved in 2023. And again, you'll see all that when we file our report at the end of February. Ryan Krueger : Thanks. And then can you help us understand your sensitivity to short-term interest rates, specifically as we get closer to a potential Fed cutting cycle? Kenneth Tanji : Yes. Sure, Ryan. The bottom line is that there's -- we don't expect much net impact from short-term rates. We have cash and collateral balances that earn short-term yields. And that would generally be offset by interest rate derivatives from our investment portfolio, where we're actually paying short-term rates and receiving fixed to manage duration. The two generally offset each other. Ryan Krueger : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Alex Scott : Hi. So, I wanted to touch on the capital as well. I mean you're in a much stronger position sort of going into 2024 compared to a year ago. I just wanted to get an update on how you're thinking about priorities for deploying that capital? I know at times you've talked about finding some ways to enhance growth. I mean, certainly, organic growth across some of your businesses has begun to pick up as well. But how are you thinking about all of that? And how do you look at driving more growth into the business? Charles Lowrey : Sure. Alex, it's Charlie. I'll take that. Thanks for the question. We have said that we've always wanted -- that we want to be good stewards of capital. And as a result, we want to have a consistent disciplined and balanced approach to the redeployment of capital within our businesses, as you said, and to shareholders. And there are really three aspects to our approach on which we focus. First and foremost is maintaining our rock-solid balance sheet and financial strength, which is critical to fulfilling the promises we make to our customers and clients. Second is investing both organically and through programmatic acquisitions to support sustainable long-term growth of our businesses. And the third is returning excess capital to shareholders as we have in the past. And in this quarter, we've done all three. We've deployed capital to support strong sales across our businesses, including several new products to meet the evolving needs of our customers. We closed on the Deerpath acquisition for PGIM, and we returned over $700 million to shareholders. So we'll continue to have this consistent and disciplined approach as we go forward Alex Scott : Thank you. The second question I had is on PGIM flows. I was hoping you could just provide a little more color on what you expect going into 2024 as some of these headwinds begin to abate that have driven some outflows. Andrew Sullivan : Yes. Alex, it's Andy. Thanks for your question. We're not satisfied with the recent flow performance of the business, and we have been, and we're going to continue to take the appropriate actions to restore that performance to historical norms. That really starts with ensuring that we have a range of strategies and vehicles so that we can broadly serve our customers. You've seen us continue to intentionally invest into the business to accomplish just that. So we've continued our expansion into private alternatives with the acquisitions of Montana Capital Partners and Deerpath. You've also seen us launch new vehicles like exchange traded funds and ESG strategies. All that work adds to an already broad and diversified portfolio. The second thing I would tell you is flows and active management are correlated with investment performance. And our performance strengthened throughout all of 2023, but flows can lag. So that's one of the reasons we're constructive on the outlook looking forward. Third, we've continued -- we've not taken our foot off the gas on investing in distribution because of those three things, product breadth, investment results and distribution lead to active flows over the longer term. Let me also add that like others, I'm sure you're hearing, we believe that the record money market assets that are sitting on the sideline will flow back into fixed income once inflation and rates are stabilized and the rate trajectory, people are more confident in it. we're ready to capitalize on that given the strength of our investment performance with 81% of our assets outperforming benchmark over five and 10 years. So, clearly not satisfied about the recent flow performance, but optimistic looking forward. I would just end by noting we saw a pickup in gross inflows towards the end of 4Q, and that has continued into this year. So we're optimistic. Alex Scott : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Elyse Greenspan : Hi. Thanks. My first question is on, I guess, sticking with PGIM. In the slides, you still call out -- you call out programmatic M&A there. You just provide an update just on the pipeline of transactions, and what you might be thinking about there? Andrew Sullivan : So, thanks, Elyse. It's Andy. So I won't get obviously specific around pipeline, but maybe just bring it up a level, we've demonstrated our strong ability to grow PGIM organically over a long period of time. So we certainly don't look at it as we need M&A to grow. That said, we do remain interested in augmenting our organic growth with mergers and acquisitions. Montana Capital Partners, PGIM Custom Harvest and then obviously, our closure of Deerpath in December. Those are great examples of us adding capabilities in higher growth, higher fee areas of the industry. So, as we look forward, we're going to continue to look to globalize the business. and we're going to focus on higher growth, higher fee areas, so areas like private alternatives and real asset capabilities. Clearly, periods of time like this that are disruptive can lead to opportunities, so we're making sure that we're in the know and in the flow on what's going on. We've also seen an uptick in activity in the marketplace. But as always, we're going to remain patient and disciplined in our approach. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks. And then my second one is on the RBC. So it's now greater than 425, right? And you guys saw a nice lift in the quarter. you look to maintain Pega's RBC ratio around this level? Or is that something that you would maybe manage down over time and look to bring more capital to parent? Kenneth Tanji : Yes, Elyse, it's Ken. We're well within our AA financial objectives on an RBC basis. Now, it's not the only thing that matters for our credit rating. But on that measure, we're where we need to be, and we have flexibility. So, we -- again, we'll balance maintaining financial strength, which is obviously important to our value proposition growth and also distribution to shareholders. So, we're balancing all three of those objectives. Elyse Greenspan : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Suneet Kamath : Thanks. Good morning. First of all, thank you to Ken for all of your help over the years. I really appreciate it. My first question is just on the SGUL deal with Somerset Re. If I remember correctly, that was supposed to close in the fourth quarter. Obviously, we haven't seen an announcement on that yet. So, maybe just an update there? And are you still expecting $450 million of proceeds when that deal closes? Robert Falzon : Suneet, it's Rob. Yes, the deal continues to proceed toward closing. Our counterparty has actually received its regulatory approval. We've got one or two final steps on our end, but we expect a closing in this quarter. Just a couple of reminders. One is, recall it is retrospective to the beginning of the year, so 1/1/24. And with respect to the financial impacts, annual earnings as well as one-time closing costs and capital, we'll update that in an announcement once we close. Suneet Kamath : Got it. And then I guess on PGIM, totally appreciate the strong five and 10-year numbers, but it looks like the three-year number, 63% outperforming is a little bit lower. Is that something that we should -- that could have an impact on kind of the flow dynamics, or is there something maybe that will drop off? Or -- I just want to get some color on how you're thinking about that three-year number? Andrew Sullivan : Yes, Suneet, I would focus on how much our investment performance has strengthened here in the near term. We did have a period of time. We're an active manager. We have many high conviction strategies designed to produce alpha. We went through a brief period in 2021, 2022, where we did see a dip in performance is specifically in our fixed income business, but that performance has strengthened quite nicely and is very, very strong right now. So, we don't expect that to have a major impact on us looking forward. Suneet Kamath : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Jimmy Bhullar : Hi. Good morning. So first, a question for Charlie, maybe on capital and just capital deployment overall. Can you talk about what your priorities are and where do -- and how do you think about M&A and/or share buybacks? Because it seems like you certainly have the capacity to do more in buybacks given your capital generation than you've been doing, but not sure if you're prioritizing other things instead as well. Charles Lowrey : Sure. As I mentioned to Alex earlier, we do -- we have a consistent and balanced approach. And -- as a result, Jimmy, we really look for, again, the three things. One is to make sure that we have a very strong balance sheet, which we do, as Ken was talking about. The second is to invest organically in our businesses, and you've seen us do that, and we will continue to do that to support sales growth, to support the growth of all our businesses as we go forward and then to look for acquisitions that make sense. Those would be in higher growth areas. It could be in distribution, it could be in geography as well. We also see tremendous opportunities right now in the marketplace in places like PRT, right, where we are one of the leaders in this business. We think there's going to be tremendous volume there, and that's a really good business for us as we go forward. And Caroline, you may want to talk about that in one moment. The final thing, as we've talked about, is returning excess capital to shareholders. We've done that in the past. And if we think we have excess capital, we'll do so. But we're going to evaluate that relative to our investment in our businesses and the opportunities that come along. And Caroline, you might want to talk about one in particular. Caroline Feeney : Yes, absolutely. So Jimmy, we did finish another strong year in pension transfer. We closed 11 transactions worth almost $6 billion finishing as the number two pensioners transfer writer. And we've already built on that positive momentum this year, with a $5 billion deal with Shell. It's our largest first quarter pensioners' transfer ever. And with this win, Prudential now has completed seven of the top 10 US PRT transactions on record. We also see that strong sales trend continuing. It's driven by healthy pipelines due to favorable funding positions of over 100%. And last year's market volume was roughly $45 billion. And we do expect to see that healthy pipeline continue this year. And although the market is highly with more new entrants, very few competitors have executed transactions exceeding $1 billion. And while transactions will continue to be episodic in our PRT, business our expertise and our ability to handle large complex transactions and our leadership position in service delivery, we believe will position us well to remain a leader in the market. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. And then just in Latin America, can you share what your views are in terms of potential pension reform in the Chilean market, and what the reasonable case or sort of a worst-case impact would be on Prudential's business there? Andrew Sullivan : Yes. So Jimmy its Andy. Thank you for your question. As we've talked about before, our priority is always delivering for our customers' day-in and day-out. We're very leaned into what's in their best interest. As you would expect, because of that, we believe in being very proactive on advocating on their behalf. We're going to continue to advocate for reform and improve the pension outcomes in Latin America and specifically for the citizens of Chile. Just to give you an update, in Chile, the constitutional referendum was rejected on December 17, but after two failed attempts. So President Ports really has moved on and is now focused squarely on pension reform. And there is a proposal that's advancing through Congress. That bill proposes to eliminate AFPs and to increase employer contributions to 6%, and we\u2019re closely monitoring that situation, as a package would impact our Habitat JV. But I would say just a couple of things. Our Habitat JV is a high-quality, very well-run business. It's been working to actively diversify across countries and into voluntary savings offerings. And if you take a step back, just recognize that Joint Venture, while it's obviously a larger component of our emerging markets. It's not a material contributor to PFI earnings. So we'll obviously stay very close to it, and we'll let you know when we have any more clarity. Jimmy Bhullar : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Joel Hurwitz from Dowling & Partners. Your line is now live. Joel Hurwitz : Hey. Good morning. So, I know lapses have periodically been an issue in Japan just given exchange rates. It looks like there were a pretty sizable quarter-over-quarter reduction in the in-force of main both international businesses in the quarter. Can you just talk about what you saw in terms of [Indiscernible] there? Andrew Sullivan : Yes. So thanks, Joel, its Andy. So let me just talk about the decline in the in-force. First, as I always start, we're exceptionally proud of our Japanese businesses. They've been very consistent and stable contributors to Prudential for a very long time. With that, there are a few factors, though, that are impacting the life insurance in-force amounts. First, this is important to note, a significant portion of our recent sales are investment contracts, and that really reflects what customers are looking to buy. Those sales do not include a material life component, but are contributing to our earnings. Second, we are seeing natural runoff in the older life blocks, particularly in the legacy yen business in Gibraltar. And then as we've talked about in previous quarters, with the recent yen depreciation, we've seen a modestly elevated level of surrenders. But all that said, we are confident in our ability to grow and diversify our Japanese businesses across insurance, investment and retirement security, and we're continuing to invest in them. Joel Hurwitz : Okay, helpful. And then switching gears to group. So you reduced the benefit ratio target there. Can you just talk about the overall drivers to the reduction there? And what's the growth outlook for that business? It looks like top line for full year was roughly flat. Just any color on growth expectations there. Caroline Feeney : Yes, absolutely, Joel. It's Caroline. Thank you so much for your question. So first of all, I'll start off by saying we had another very strong quarter for group insurance and we're very pleased with the full year results of this business. And we believe we're in that strong position in group given the progress we've made in executing on our strategy and our future earnings power will reflect the efforts we've made to grow in a disciplined and profitable manner. We continue to focus on diversifying our business by expanding in the under 5,000 live market and the association segment. We're adding new products like supplemental health and continuing our growth and disability. And we made progress in that diversification effort, increasing our disability premiums and fees at a higher rate than before and our supplemental health premiums also grew at strong double-digit annual growth rates. And this diversification is driving stronger core earnings with higher margins. So, as for our performance, our full year benefits ratio was just over 83 percentage points. It includes very strong performance in our Life block in the second and third quarters of last year and record disability results in the first half of the year. While we don't expect that record performance to continue and definitely, there are certainly other factors to consider. So, overall, Joel, I'd say that our group business is growing. It's doing so at attractive margins with COVID having transitioned to an endemic state combined with our diversification strategy I just walked you through as well as investments we've made in improving our claims management capabilities and strategic partnerships. We believe we'll see that underwriting performance and earnings power continue to improve. And that is why we are confident with our decision in lowering our benefit ratio guidance to be 83% to 87% for the year. And in terms of just future earnings power as well, I gave you some color there as well, Joel. We believe the future earnings power and group insurance will continue to be strong as we continue to grow and execute on our strategy. Joel Hurwitz : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Wilma Burdis from Raymond James. Your line is now live. Wilma Burdis : Hey. Good morning. I'm just wondering if there's been any activity with Prismic? Seeing that you guys have focused on the sales of [indiscernible] and also with this large PRT deals. So if you can give us an update there, please? Robert Falzon : Hi, Wilma, it's Rob. So as we've articulated before, we're quite enthusiastic about Prisma and more broadly about what we see to be the opportunities that are coming out of the intersection between asset management and insurance and specifically the role that Prismic can play and helping us to execute against that opportunity. We believe it will create avenues of growth across our businesses, not specifically for the PRT transaction that we recently announced, but the opportunity to be a source of financing for sales growth, both in the retirement marketplace and our other businesses on a go-forward basis. Our investors, which are extremely large global institutional investors share our aspirations, both from a directional standpoint and from a quantum standpoint. So our expectation is to go well beyond the initial $10 billion structured securities or structured settlements transaction that we completed. It's going to include some level of ongoing balance sheet optimization. It's going to include, as I noted, financing the growth across our businesses. I think what's unique in a way about Prismic is the appetite by it and its investors for longer duration and more complex liabilities. And we're also going to look to do third-party blocks as well in Prismic, all of which will in order the benefit of increasing the assets under management for our PGIM business. Wilma Burdis : Thank you. Could you talk a little bit about the buyback? I think you guys talk with the $1 billion authorization for 2024. Certainly, when you guys sell blocks and run off earnings a little bit, it's good to see more capital returns. So can you just talk about how you guys are thinking through that? Thank you. Kenneth Tanji : Yes, it's Ken. Yes, we've had a very consistent approach to shareholder distributions using both dividends and share repurchases as a way to return capital. It's our share repurchases for this year was approved by the board, and they had considered our capital position, our outlook for free cash flow, but also opportunities to deploy that capital into organic growth, as Charlie discussed, in particular, the very robust PRT market. So, all those things factored into it. We increased our dividend again. That's -- now we've increased that 16 years in a row. So again, it all factors into what we think is a very consistent approach, balancing all our objectives as well. So I hope that color helps. Wilma Burdis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler. Your line is now live. John Barnidge : Good morning. Thank you for the opportunity. And best of luck, Ken. My first question, I appreciate -- if we could go to the Group Insurance business, I appreciate the benefit ratio guidance. But is there an expense savings storing disability coming up I can't help, but notice improvement in administrative expenses in recent quarters. And with COVID moving endemic, the ramping up of expenses, should that fall to the side. Thank you. Caroline Feeney : Yes. So John, it's Caroline. Thank you so much for your question. In terms of our overall expense management, you may have seen we saw 100 basis point improvement in our admin ratio from the year ago quarter. That is driven by both business growth and continued expense discipline. And we will continue to focus on expense efficiencies and obviously then would regularly adjust our operating models to ensure the appropriate levels of service going forward. In terms of disability overall, I would say across group disability results were driven by our focus on effective claims management, including those short- and long-term disability as well as absence in family leave. We also benefited from the continued tailwinds of strong employment and high interest rate environment and our disability business had an outstanding year. I would also just want to point out something else strategically, we're doing on the disability side as we continue to grow that area. We've actually invested, John, in improving our claims management process through a strategic partnership with Evolution IQ. This is a provider of AI-driven technology that provides real-time monitoring leading to increased recoveries. So, overall, I'd say in terms of expense management, we remain highly disciplined and also, obviously, very much focused in terms of our pricing discipline. The evidence there is our ability to accomplish all this growth in maintaining our price competitiveness. But the fact that as we continue to grow our book, we're also not afraid to walk away if the pricing just doesn't make sense on any particular case. So, overall, we remain confident in our decision to lower benefit ratio guidance and feel very comfortable with our expense management and our pricing discipline. John Barnidge : Thank you for that answer. My follow-up question. When you talk about globalizing the PGIM business, are there markets you're not large in size that you want to get bigger in? Where does Prismic sit within that growth opportunity for PGIM internationally? Andrew Sullivan : So, John, I'll start out and then, Rob, if you want to tail in, you can jump in. So when we talk about globalizing the business, I think it's important to recognize that a majority of our assets under management today are in the United States. So, we've been actively, for many years now, working to expand across Europe and Asia and have invested quite heavily in distribution on both the institutional and retail side of the business. That said, as we look to continue to broaden and diversify our mix of both asset classes, but geographies, we would look to Europe and Asia as key geographies that we're most interested in growing. Robert Falzon : John, it's Rob. Just following up on Andy. Within Asia and with respect to Prismic, I think what I'd note is we see a huge opportunity in Japan, both with regard to, as Ken alluded to earlier, in the call, optimizing our own book, but also with respect to the sort of opportunities we see with third parties in that marketplace as well. John Barnidge : Appreciate that. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Ward from Citi. Your line is now live. Michael Ward : Hey, guys. Good morning. Sorry to be the one just curious if there's any update on commercial real estate side for you guys. It looked like the LTV deteriorated a little bit. Just kind of wondering how you feel about any kind of watch list or resolutions that you've made last year too. Robert Falzon : This is Rob. So I'll take your question, Mike. So a couple of thoughts. One, from an overall market standpoint, let me start there. From a peak to trough, what we've seen is across the market, about a 16% correction, and that number relates to, what I'll call, institutional quality real estate, the sort of things that we invest in or we lend against, and that's on an unlevered basis. Our estimate is that the peak to trough in this cycle across real estate types is going to probably be a little over 20%. So we've got 5% or 6% probably left in the way of price correction yet to experience. Now, within that, office, obviously, has corrected much more severely closer to 30% to date, and probably has another 10%, 15% yet to go. Because the construction of our portfolio is significantly underweight office, and because the overall quality of the portfolio and the diversification of it across geography and property types, and importantly, because this is a portfolio that's directly originated by PGIM with the team that's deep and averages some 25 years of industry experience, we're actually finding that our portfolio is holding up quite well. So loan to values across the portfolio were about 58% and our discount -- our debt service coverage ratios remain right around 2.5%. Within our overall portfolio, our actual valuations increased about 6% during the course of 2023 despite the fact that we saw a double-digit decline in the office component of our portfolio. But again, because that office component is only 2% of our assets or 50% -- about 14% of our mortgages, the performance of the rest of the portfolio has offset that. So, with regard to portfolio performance, we're actually feeling quite good. The last thing that you asked about was sort of what we're seeing in watch list, et cetera. I guess the way I would describe that, Mike, is that, first, if we look at our experience with maturities during 2023, we had about $2 billion worth of scheduled maturities. Of those, we provided modifications for four -- less than $400 million of that $2 billion with those modifications providing longer-term extensions. The remainder of all of those maturities was resolved favorably through refinancing payoffs or short-term extensions that then led or leading to subsequent payoffs. In the upcoming year 2024, we've got about $3 billion of maturities coming on. That's about 6% of the portfolio that's maturing. And while we don't expect to be immune from this cycle by any means, we do expect that on a relative basis, we'll be quite resilient. We increased our reserves in the real estate portfolio to around $370 million as of the end of the year and that represents about 72 basis points, and we think that that's well provisioned against the portfolio, again, given what we've experienced in the underlying quality of that portfolio. Michael Ward : Awesome. Really helpful. Thanks, Rob. Operator : Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lowrey for any further closing comments. Charles Lowrey : So, thank you again for joining us today. The fourth quarter capped a year of continued growth and evolution for Prudential. Our strategy, coupled with our mutually reinforcing business system positions us well to deliver long-term sustainable growth to all our stakeholders. Our fundamentals are strong, and we are confident about our momentum going into 2024. We will continue to lead the way in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security across the globe, as we seek to help current and future generations build a secure financial future. Thank you again for joining us, and have a good day. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Bob McLaughlin. Please go ahead. Robert McLaughlin : Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today's call are Charlie Lowrey, Chairman and CEO; Rob Falzon, Vice Chairman; Andy Sullivan, Head of International Businesses and PGIM, our global investment manager; Caroline Feeney, Head of U.S. Businesses; Yanela Frias, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by Charlie, Rob and Yanela, and then we will take your questions. Today's discussion may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. In addition, our presentation includes references to non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of such measures to the comparable GAAP measures and a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, please see the slides titled Forward-Looking Statements and non-GAAP Measures in the appendix to today's presentation and the quarterly financial supplement, both of which can be found on our website at investor.prudential.com. And now I'll turn it over to Charlie. Charles Lowrey : Thank you, Bob, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our results for the quarter reflect accelerating momentum across all our businesses, including significant positive net flows in PGIM, our global asset manager and strong sales in our U.S. and International Insurance businesses. During the quarter, we made substantial progress in shifting our business mix and growing our market-leading businesses to become a higher growth, more capital efficient and nimble company. We also maintained our disciplined approach to capital management by making further investments in our businesses and returning additional capital to shareholders. Our rock-solid balance sheet, business mix and distinct strategy position us to deliver long-term growth for our stakeholders. Turning to Slide 3. I'll now begin this morning with a few recent examples that demonstrate how we are growing our market-leading businesses. PGIM achieved robust third-party and affiliated net flows in the quarter, notably in our fixed-income business, underpinned by continued strong investment performance. These flows reinforce the benefits of our large and strategic global client relationships and the power of our mutually reinforcing business system to grow our asset management fees. Our Institutional Retirement Strategies business reported strong sales and record account values, including the benefits of 2 large pension risk transfer transactions in the quarter. As a result, we delivered a record first quarter of PRT sales. Meanwhile, our Individual Retirement Strategies business recorded its best sales quarter in more than a decade. This reflects the continued diversification and expansion of our product offerings as well as strong demand in the market. Strong growth in our group insurance elected our product and segment diversification strategy leading to increased sales across life, disability and supplemental health. Meanwhile, our individual life insurance business continues to shift towards more capital-efficient products and broaden solutions through newer offerings like FlexGuard Life, which had its highest sales quarter since launching in 2022. Internationally, we continue to benefit from our broadening product portfolio in Japan and from our actions to expand our distribution to new customers in emerging markets. Prudential in Brazil saw strong momentum across all distribution channels, most notably in our Life Planner channel, which reported record sales for the quarter. We achieved these milestones while continuing to pivot away from more capital-intensive and lower-growth businesses. We successfully closed a reinsurance transaction for a portion of our guaranteed universal life block further advancing our strategy to reduce market sensitivity and increase capital efficiency. We also announced an agreement to sell Prudential of Argentina, a move aligned with our strategy of focusing on fewer high-growth emerging markets where we have an opportunity to achieve scale. And finally, we initiated the process to exit our Assurance business so that we can focus our efforts and resources on core businesses and capabilities. We also continue to strengthen our operating model through technology and strategic partnerships to generate efficiencies that can be reinvested to fuel growth and deliver exceptional sales, service and claims experiences. This ongoing focus on improving the ways we work and supporting our customers continues to be recognized outside the company. As just one example, Prudential of Japan recently ranked #1 for life insurance service in a J.D. Power customer satisfaction survey for the ninth year in a row. We are proud to be recognized for the value we provide to our customers. Turning now to Slide 4. Our disciplined approach to capital deployment enables us to invest in our market-leading businesses to support long-term growth and return capital to shareholders. In the first quarter, we returned over $700 million to shareholders and increased the quarterly dividend by 4%, our 16th consecutive annual dividend increase. We will continue to focus on creating sustainable, profitable growth that will benefit all stakeholders. Moving to Slide 5. Our growth strategy is supported by Prudential's rock-solid balance sheet and robust risk and capital management framework. Our AA-rated financial strength represents a strong capital position, including approximately $48 billion of unrealized insurance margins over $4 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the first quarter, a high-quality, well-diversified investment portfolio and a disciplined approach to asset liability management. We've entered the second quarter with confidence in our strategy to be a global leader in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security for people around the world. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob to provide more details on our first quarter business performance. Robert Falzon : Thanks, Charlie. I will provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM U.S. and international businesses I'll begin on Slide 6 with our financial results for the first quarter of 2024. Our pretax adjusted operating income was $1.5 billion or $3.12 per share on an after-tax basis, up 16% from the year-ago quarter. These results reflect the continued execution of our strategy to grow our market-leading businesses. Strong sales and robust net inflows and the benefit of higher interest rates and equity markets have resulted in higher spread income, fee income and underwriting results. These diversified sources of earnings were partially offset by higher expenses to support business growth and onetime costs of closing the Guaranteed Universal Life reinsurance transaction. Turning to the operating results from our businesses compared to the year-ago quarter. PGIM, our global investment manager had higher asset management fees driven by equity market appreciation, positive third-party net inflows and contributions from the Deerpath Capital acquisition. Additionally, higher incentive fees and seed and co-investment income resulted in an increase in other related revenues. This was partially offset by higher expenses to support business growth. Earnings growth in our U.S. businesses reflected higher spread income driven by business growth and the benefit of higher interest rates and variable investment income as well as more favorable underwriting results. This was partially offset by higher expenses, including the onetime charges associated with the closing of the Guaranteed Universal Life reinsurance transaction and by lower legacy traditional variable annuity fee income as we intentionally continue our pivot to less market-sensitive products. Earnings growth in our International businesses was primarily driven by higher spread income, including the benefit of higher interest rates and more favorable variable investment income and higher joint venture earnings due to the favorable encaje performance in Chile. This was partially offset by less favorable underwriting results, primarily reflecting policyholder behavior. Turning to Slide 7. PGIM, our global investment manager, has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, equities and alternatives. PGIM's strong investment performance continues to improve with 80% of assets under management exceeding their benchmarks over the past year. This has contributed favorably to attractive long-term performance with over 80% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last 5- and 10-year periods. PGIM's assets under management increased by 6% to $1.3 trillion from the year-ago quarter, driven by market appreciation and positive third-party net flows. Robust third-party net inflows in the quarter totaled $26.6 billion. Institutional inflows of $26 billion included a large fixed-income client mandate. And retail flows also turned positive, reflecting building momentum in public fixed income. Additionally, strong affiliated flows were driven by retirement strategy sales during the quarter as the investment engine of Prudential, the success and growth of PGIM and of our U.S. and International insurance and retirement businesses are mutually reinforcing. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise and access to institutional and other sources of private capital, including through the recently launched reinsurer Prismic, our competitive advantage helping our businesses bring enhanced solutions and create more value for our customers. Our insurance and retirement businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated net flows as well as unique access to insurance liabilities. In addition, our diversified PGIM private alternatives platform, which has assets under management of approximately $240 billion experienced strong private credit activity driven by our organic growth and the first full quarter benefit from acquiring Deerpath Capital. Turning to Slide 8. Our U.S. businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income and benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to focus on growing our market-leading businesses by transforming our capabilities to improve customer experiences and expanding our addressable market with new financial solutions leveraging the capabilities across Prudential. Retirement strategies generated strong sales of $14.3 billion in the first quarter across its institutional and individual lines of business. Institutional Retirement sales of $11 billion in the first quarter included 2 large U.S. funded pension risk transfer transactions of nearly $9 billion, driving the strongest first quarter in market history. We have now completed 6 of the 10 largest transactions on record. Individual Retirement posted $3.3 billion in sales, our best quarter in sales in over a decade. Our product pivots have resulted in continued strong sales of FlexGuard and FlexCard Income, which increased nearly 60% from the year-ago quarter and fixed annuity sales have nearly tripled, while we continue to reduce market sensitivity by running off our legacy variable annuities. Group Insurance sales increased 18% compared to the prior year, driven by growth in life, disability and supplemental health. We are executing our strategy of both product and client segment diversification while leveraging technology to increase operating efficiency and enhance the customer experience. In Individual Life, we continue to execute our strategic pivot to more capital-efficient products with the closing of the guaranteed Universal Life reinsurance transaction. Total sales in Individual Life increased 12% from the year-ago quarter, including the benefit from the recently launched FlexGuard Life product. Variable Life products represented approximately 70% of sales for the quarter. Turning to Slide 9. Our International businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in targeted high-growth emerging markets. In Japan, we're focused on providing high-quality service and expanding our distribution and product offerings. Our needs-based approach and protection product focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. In emerging markets, we're focused on creating a selective portfolio of businesses in regions where customer needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market-leading businesses and where the Prudential enterprise can add value. Sales in our International businesses were up 5% compared to the year-ago quarter. Higher sales in Japan are benefiting from the recent product launches, including a new yen-denominated variable life product offered through our Life Consultant and independent agency channels beginning in the first quarter. In addition, emerging market sales were higher, driven by growth in Brazil as we continue to expand third-party distribution and benefit from the strong performance of our world-class life planners. As we look ahead, we are well-positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We continue to focus on investing in growth businesses and markets, delivering industry-leading customer experiences and creating the next generation of financial solutions to serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. And with that, I'll now hand it over to Yanela. Yanela del Frias : Thank you, Rob. I will begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the second quarter of 2024 relative to our first-quarter results. As noted, pretax adjusted operating income for the first quarter was $1.5 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $3.12 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense of how our second quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items : Underwriting experience was below expectations by $85 million in the first quarter, and we expect $10 million of favorable seasonality in the second quarter. We also included an adjustment of $50 million for expenses and other items. This includes adjustments for typical seasonality of expenses and premiums as well as the onetime expenses related to our guaranteed universal life reinsurance transaction. These adjustments combined get us to a baseline of $3.43 per share for the second quarter. I will note that if you exclude items specific to the second quarter, earnings per share would be $3.50. The key takeaway is that we continue to drive underlying earnings power momentum as we invest in the growth of our market-leading businesses and pivot away from capital-intensive and lower-growth businesses. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the second quarter. Turning to Slide 11. Our capital position continues to support our AA financial strength rating. Our regulatory capital ratios are in excess of our AA objectives. Our cash and liquid assets were $4.2 billion within our liquidity target range of $3 billion to $5 billion, and we have substantial off-balance sheet resources. We remain thoughtful in our capital deployment, investing in our businesses for long-term growth and returning capital to shareholders. Turning to Slide 12. And in summary, we are becoming a higher growth, more capital efficient and nimble company. We are maintaining a disciplined approach to capital deployment and our growth is supported by our rock-solid balance sheet. And with that, we will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Ryan Krueger : My first question was on Prismic. Can you talk about the outlook for reinsuring in-force blocks, additional in-force blocks to Prismic and do you expect more activity on this in 2024? Robert Falzon : Ryan, it's Rob. I'll take your question. As we've shared before, we and our Prismic investors who are a group of very large global institutional investors that operate and scale have aspirations that go well beyond the initial $10 billion transaction that we completed last year. We're continuing work on an active pipeline. That pipeline includes ongoing balance sheet optimization. It includes flow or new sales that are solutions across our businesses and working on third-party blocks where we believe we can provide our reinsurance and asset management capabilities to other insurers. To maybe state the obvious, these transactions are complex. They're bespoke to each situation and they require regulatory coordination and all of that takes time. Our decision to use Prismic for this pipeline has contrasted to the opportunity to also use our own balance sheet or to partner or reinsure with other third parties is unique to each of the opportunities. And it's driven by looking through a lens of commercial priorities, statutory considerations, GAAP outcomes and economic considerations. And that includes implications to earnings ROE, capital and liquidity. If I could step back and sort of more broadly, address it. We see extraordinarily interesting growth opportunities at the intersection of what we're calling the intersection of asset management and insurance. Private institutional capital is coming into the insurance space, insurance and retirement sector. It helps to finance the growth and to meet customer needs -- customer and client needs. And in addition, the investment options that are available to the industry are expanding, and they're providing opportunities to grow investment capabilities while enhancing portfolio diversification and generating greater output from our portfolio as well. We're excited about what this implies for our ability to create avenues of growth across our insurance, retirement and asset management businesses. And we believe that our brand, scale, and the quality across our businesses gives us a highly competitive platform to execute against the opportunity and Prismic is an important expansion of that platform. Ryan Krueger : Great. And then separately on -- I had a question on G&A expenses. I think they were up around 7% year-over-year on a consolidated basis. And previously, you had talked about taking expense actions that could keep G&A relatively flat in the near term. So I was hoping for an update on that. Yanela del Frias : Ryan, this is Yanela. And I will take your question. We are committed to keeping expenses flat while investing in our businesses. And as you noted, we did see an increase in G&A this quarter, but keep in mind that G&A includes expenses to support growth, including nondeferrable sales expenses in support of our very strong sales this quarter as well as onetime expenses like the cost-related to the GUL transaction. So that's what you're seeing in terms of the increase. With regards to the strong sales, especially in retirement strategies, please note that the incremental earnings from those sales are not all fully reflected in the quarter. And there's 2 reasons, the timing of those sales as well as the fact that we leg into the final asset portfolio supporting the PRT sales over a period of time. So as a result, we expect that the full incremental earnings benefit to emerge in subsequent quarters. And Caroline, I don't know if you wanted to spend a minute on retirement strategies, fundamentals. Caroline Feeney-Pfundstein: Yes, sure. Of course, Yanela, thanks. And Ryan, clearly, Yanela just went through some of the earnings drivers. So now let me share with you how we're thinking about the fundamentals in our growth story. So overall, we're very pleased with the strong sales growth across our Retirement Strategies business. with over $14 billion in sales this past quarter. In Institutional, we achieved $11 billion in sales led by nearly $9 billion of pension risk transfer, not only our best first quarter, Ryan, but also the best first quarter in market history, further demonstrating our leadership in the market. And then on the individual side, we had our best quarter in over a decade with almost $3.5 billion in sales nearly doubling our volume from the year-ago quarter. And that success comes from our work over the past few years to diversify our annuity portfolio and broaden our distribution which allows us to meet more of the consumer needs for protected savings and for income than ever before. And as Yanela mentioned, these strong sales will continue to increase core earnings over time as we realize the full impact of these sales. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Thomas Gallagher : First question is just on the I think, what was a jumbo PGIM inflow that you got from a single client this quarter? I think that might have been $25 billion or $26 billion. And if that's not right, can you please sort of clarify what that amount was? And then what was the mandate in? Was that public fixed income? And any kind of sense for what kind of fee rate you would have had on that? Andrew Sullivan : Tom, it's Andy. So this mandate was a significant portion of the $26 billion that we saw in institutional positive net flows. Obviously, we don't disclose fee rate on individual mandates. That said, this is a large mandate from a key pension client for a high-quality fixed-income portfolio. So the fee rate is lower than our overall average fee rate across our asset classes. We were very pleased with our flows overall this quarter, and we're obviously very proud that we have so many large clients that place their trust in us. Thomas Gallagher : And Andy, just as a follow-up, any -- how does the pipeline look? Any other sizable large mandates you think might get funded this year? Andrew Sullivan : Yes. So maybe, Tom, let me just bring it up and I'll end with the outcome. So overall, on the institutional side, we're obviously very pleased given that large mandate, we feel that reinforces our position as a leading partner in the marketplace. And I'd also add that we've been consistently adding new clients to our roster on the institutional side every quarter, every year. On the retail side, we saw positive flows of about $0.5 billion. We're beginning to see early momentum in the retail fixed-income space, consistent with industry trends and improving client sentiment. I would reiterate what Rob said at the top of the script as well that we had significant positive affiliated flows this quarter driven by pension risk transfer, showing the strength and importance of the synergies in the business system. As far as specific to your question, the outlook looking forward, we like the fundamentals that we're seeing as the environment is clearly improving, and our investment performance is very, very strong. But we also know that a sticky inflationary environment will keep money on the sidelines a little while longer and that our large client flows can remain episodic. But the key punchline is, over time, we are very confident that will be a net winner and a net grower. Thomas Gallagher : Great. Rob, just if I could slip one more in about a follow-up to what Ryan asked about Prismic. Have you guys done any additional fundraising beyond the first $1 billion for Prismic? And if you haven't, any thoughts on how much you would be looking to raise in a potential next fundraising? Robert Axel : Yes, Tom, the investors that we have in Prismic and our conversations with them have indicated their desire to put a significant amount of capital to work and the strategy that we've outlined to them. And so expectations are that these are firms that deal on the billions, not the millions or hundreds of millions. And they've indicated that their desire is to scale the initial investment that they've made, which is, frankly, small by their standards and would be uneconomic if it were not for their anticipation that it was going to be followed by investments that would be multiples of what they've contributed upfront. That having been said, this is not a fund. It is a collaborative of investors that have committed to working with us in this strategy and they will fund as we develop and execute against pipeline. Operator : Next question today is coming from Joel Hurwitz from Dowling & Partners. Joel Hurwitz : So I want to go back to the individual retirement sales. So a very strong quarter, including sizable growth in fixed annuity sales. Can you just talk about the pivot to fixed annuities? And I guess, what's your plan to grow in this product line? Caroline Feeney-Pfundstein: Yes. Of course, Joel. It's Caroline, and I'll take your question. So first of all, the individual annuities market had a record year last year with about $380 billion of sales, and fixed annuities were a key piece of that given the rapid rises that we did see in interest rates. We're seeing continued momentum for fixed annuities this year as the value proposition remains strong, driving industry sales of over $100 billion in the first quarter, putting the industry on track for another record year. In terms of our own growth, Joel, fixed annuities, represented almost half of our sales last quarter mirroring the broader market shift we've seen over the past few years -- past year, excuse me, our sales growth is a testament to 3 things : first, our successful expansion of our product portfolio to include more fixed annuity solutions such as our Westgard, MIGA allowing us to meet more customer needs across a broader set of channels. Second, our brand and our distribution strength, which enables us to scale quickly to meet increasing market demand. We continue to expand our partnerships across multiple channels and platforms which also had a significant impact on our business this past quarter. And finally, our dynamic and proactive pricing process, which allows us to react quickly to changing market conditions, to maintain competitive pricing while maximizing shareholder value. So overall, Joe, we're pleased with our ability to meet the increased demand while maintaining favorable returns. We like the diversification, these products bring to our business mix and the role they can play as a strong complement to our FlexGuard suite of solutions. Joel Hurwitz : Okay. So it sounds like this will be a core product in your line of filing forward then? Caroline Feeney-Pfundstein: Absolutely, Joe. Yes, we see it as a core product as we broaden our portfolio. Joel Hurwitz : Okay. And then just moving over to pension risk transfer. Just any update on your outlook and Obviously, a very strong start to the year, I guess, how should we think about your desire to grow this business year-on-year out? Caroline Feeney-Pfundstein: Yes. So as you said, Joel, and rightly so, we had a very strong start here. We finished actually the strongest first quarter ever in PRT, leading the market, including 2 transactions with Shell and Verizon totaling nearly $9 billion. In terms of our outlook on growth, last year's market volume was roughly $45 billion, and we expect to see that healthy pipeline continue this year supported by favorable funding positions of over 100%. And although the market is highly competitive, very few carriers have actually executed transactions exceeding $1 billion. And I should call out that our expertise and our ability to handle large complex transactions along with our financial strength, position us to continue to be a leader in the space. Joel Hurwitz : Okay. I guess, just how do you balance the capital strain from growing that business? Just how should we think about your appetite for overall growth this year after doing $9 billion in Q1. Caroline Feeney-Pfundstein: Yes. So I'd say, in general, Joel, obviously, each large transaction naturally consumes its appropriate share of capital. We believe these deals are a very effective way of deploying capital. and we like the returns that we're generating. First, PRT remains a great source for organic growth. It represents one of the few products that can allow us to originate billions of insurance liabilities in a single transaction. And as a market leader in the space, we continue to see, as I mentioned, a strong pipeline of those large-sized opportunities. I'll also add that the success of our PRT business benefits PGIM as we continue to originate these deals PGIM can match our insurance liabilities with a high-quality portfolio of assets. So with all that being said, Joel, we do expect to continue to opportunistically deploy capital in the space and we feel good about the returns as well as the benefits PRT brings to Prudential. Operator : Your next question today is coming from Wes Carmichael from Autonomous. Wesley Carmichael : Rob, on your answer on Prismic, you mentioned the transactions require regulatory coordination is one of the considerations here. I'm just wondering if you can give us an update on the regulatory environment in Bermuda and how that's changed, if at all, over the past year if the CMA is more involved in improving potential deals or influencing the structure of transactions. Robert Axel : Yes, Wes, happy to do so. We've actually been highly engaged with the BMA throughout the consultation process that it recently went through and provided feedback on the proposed enhancements to their regime directly with the BMA as well as in coordination with the broader industry. I think what I would characterize is that while the BMA's updates to regulatory regime are generally going to result in a more conservative level of capital required and reserving than what they had prior to their consultation process. That's going to vary significantly by product type. And the BMA is committed to continuing to maintain a principles-based economically driven regime. And we believe that the combination of that approach to managing insurance assets and liabilities along with its status with reciprocal jurisdiction in the U.S. and equivalency in Europe is going to continue to make it a very attractive jurisdiction to do business for insurers. Wesley Carmichael : And maybe just a quick follow-up on that. But do you think PRT is a good liability for Prismic? Does that make sense there? Robert Falzon : PRT can be done economically, both within the U.S. statutory regime and within the Bermuda statutory regime. We've advanced, adopted a set of principles that are under consideration for pension risk transfer type liabilities in coordination with our New Jersey supervisor. And so our ability or desire to use Bermuda versus the U.S. statutory regime is less driven by differences in the regimes per se and more driven by the source of investors coming into it. So obviously, for our own balance sheet, operating within the U.S. statutory regime works well for us. But to the extent we want to bring third-party capital into that capital has a desire for a number of reasons. Those institutions providing that capital to come into jurisdictions like Barbuda, and that would be more of the primary driver as to why we would be funding some of PRT through our Bermuda framework as contrasted to a U.S. framework. Wesley Carmichael : That's really helpful. And then maybe just one more on the regulatory front. But can you give us just an update on the transition to ESR in Japan, we're getting closer to the implementation date here. So has there been any movement, particularly on how long-duration FX products are treated or anything else? Any other color might be helpful. Yanela del Frias : This is Yanela. Let me give you an update on where we are with ESR. On ESR, we believe our Japan businesses are well capitalized and financially strong, and that would be evident under any reasonable capital standard. We have been working with regulators and advocating for reasonable and responsible standards. And we have strategies to adapt to the potential new regime and to better match the economics of our business. And these strategies include reinsurance business internally in the U.S. or Bermuda or reassuring externally. And as an example of these strategies, during the first quarter, we reinsured $3 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated whole life products from Japan to our Bermuda affiliate, Gibraltar, which allows us to manage capital for that block on a more economic basis. So we're looking at this very carefully. The proposed regulations are still subject to change. but are expected to be finalized later this quarter ahead of being effective on April 1, 2025. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question today is coming from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : My first question, I guess, is on the M&A side, right? Can you just give us an update on the pipeline and things that you're looking at? And given the action to exit Assurance IQ, how is that going to impact future M&A decisions? Charles Lowrey : Sure, Elyse. This is Charlie. Thanks for the question. We've executed on many transactions over time that have significantly grown the company. And we have pursued these transactions or acquisitions for a variety of reasons such as expanding our capabilities, broadening our distribution, increasing scale and/or adding key talent. In every acquisition, there are things that have gone right as well as lessons we have learned. And certainly, we anticipated a different outcome when we purchased Assurance, and we've incorporated these lessons into our M&A approach, which gets to your question. As we look forward, we will focus on acquisitions of more established businesses that present opportunities to expand our capabilities and scale in our existing market-leading businesses. And you've seen that -- we've seen us do that with Deerpath Capital, Montana Capital Partners and Green Harvest as 3 examples. And we're going to continue to be really thoughtful and very disciplined about how we execute with the goal of creating value for our shareholders. Elyse Greenspan : And then my second question, within group, good results in the quarter, you guys were towards the lower end of the target range for that business for the year. Just anything you want to point out, especially in the disability side, results seem good in the quarter? And how you expect the benefits ratio in that business to trend over the other 3 quarters of the year. Caroline Feeney-Pfundstein: Sure. Of course, Elyse, it's Caroline, and I'll take your question. So first of all, we're very pleased with our first quarter sales for group overall, which are influenced by the momentum we've seen in executing on our strategy to maintain our core product leadership while growing in the under 5,000 lives and association markets and further diversifying in disability and supplemental health. Our capabilities continue to resonate in the disability marketplace where our earned premiums were up nearly 15% and compared to the prior year quarter. In terms of drivers of our success, we're continuing to expand our value proposition by enhancing our customer experience, including streamlining our claims process with simplified language, with more efficient technology. That outcome is enabling customers to better understand their benefits. And then beyond these investments, at least in our core capabilities, we also remain highly focused on maintaining strong pricing discipline, only accepting those cases that make economic sense. So looking ahead at this year, as you know, most of our new business premiums are effective in the first quarter. So in general, the first quarter is when you will see the majority of the impact from new sales, renewals and enrollment on existing business. However, as we continue to grow in the under 5,000 lives in association market. We will see that sales season extend more into the second half of the year with business growth consistent with what we saw last year. So overall, we're very excited about the growth trajectory that we're seeing, not just in disability but across the board in our group business. And you asked about benefits ratio, Elyse. And so I'll just finally add that our overall -- our group underwriting results as has quarter were strong. We've recorded a total benefit ratio of just under 85%, which is our best first quarter benefit ratio ever and is within our recently lowered target range of 83 to 87. Specifically with regards to the disability underwriting results, it does reflect our focus on effective claims management and the continued tailwinds of strong employment as well as a high interest rate environment. Operator : Our next question is coming from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies. Suneet Kamath : To start with Individual Retirement. Caroline, you had mentioned the strong sales, and I think you're expecting that will persist going forward for you in the industry. Just wanted to get a sense of where that money is coming from. Is this new money coming to the industry, maybe from the qualified market? Or are we seeing 1035 exchanges from existing annuities? Just wanted to get a sense of where that demand is coming from. Caroline Feeney-Pfundstein: Yes, Suneet, it's a great question. Thanks so much. I don't think it's really one thing. I think it's the dynamic of individuals thinking more clearly as we have over 11,000 individuals turning 65 every single year over the next several years and 30 million Americans going to be turning 65 between now and 2030. And I think, unfortunately, many realizing that they have more work to do on retirement and understanding that protected income and protected savings is now increasingly more important to them and a priority. We're seeing that. And I think that is why we have seen 2 consecutive record years in the annuities market. It's also why, as I mentioned earlier, we very much see that we're on track for now a third consecutive record year of sales. And so I think it's really customer needs and broader solutions that we as an industry are able to offer. And certainly, we're very proud of the work that we have done in terms of expanding our portfolio the strength of our distribution and our brand that continues to resonate very well and positions us to be able to help many of these consumers with this growing need. Suneet Kamath : Got it. Okay. That makes sense. And then I guess, one for Rob, if I could. I think in your, Rob, you keep referencing this $48 billion of insurance margins, I don't know what that means. Like how was that calculated? And if that's such a big number, is there a way that you can start to monetize that rather than just wait for it to flow through the income statement? Robert Axel : I'll take a first stab at that, Suneet, and then I'll answer and then I'll ask Yanela to jump in if she wants to clarify anything I'm about to say. So with the change in accounting for long duration under LDTI, we now have the ability to actually calculate and share those margins. And that's what we've been doing since the adoption of those updated GAAP standards. Think about that as the present value of profits in the individual products that we have over the remaining life of those products on a gross basis. It doesn't include sort of net of expenses. So think of that as sort of just on a product basis before corporate expenses that might be associated with continuing to maintain and administer those blocks. As we think about that, that will naturally manifest over the life of the product as our experience then those margins become realized net income over the remaining period of time. There are opportunities to accelerate that. Reinsurance generally is a tool which we can use to do that, a large percentage of that -- those margins and reserves that we have exist within our Japan businesses. And within those Japan businesses, as we look to do reinsure some of that business out of Japan and into either the U.S. or Bermuda as we regularly do, that gives us opportunities to accelerate the realization of some of that margin. But Yanela, I don't know if you would like to add anything to that. Yanela del Frias : No, Rob, that was a great explanation, nothing to add. Suneet Kamath : Got it. If I could just sneak one more in for Yanela. On HoldCo cash, are there any big movements that you're expecting as we move through the year in terms of capital structure, either issuances or repayments? Or are we kind of at a steady state at this point? Yanela del Frias : No. We had the hybrid issuance in the first quarter. That was a prefunding of a 2025 maturity. So we issued $1 billion, and we also did redeem $500 million of previously issued hybrids. So from an issuance perspective, nothing more is expected. Our HLA balance did increase modestly during the quarter. As you saw, we did have net positive cash flows from our businesses after funding very strong growth, as you noted and as we've talked about, and the net proceeds of this hybrid issuance. These inflows were offset by shareholder distributions and net interest expense. Also important to note is that due to the timing of the closing of the GUL reinsurance transaction, those proceeds are in PICA and they have been factored into our capital plans for the year and that's worth about 8 RBC points. So again, from an HLA perspective in a HoldCo cash perspective, we had strong inflows. We had the expected outflows, and we are at $4.2 billion, well within our liquidity objective of $3 billion to $5 billion. Operator : Next question today is coming from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Jamminder Bhullar : First question, just on the Assurance IQ business. Should we just assume that you're shutting down the business? Or is it reasonable to assume that you'll be able to sell it for like a decent consideration? Yanela del Frias : Jimmy, it's Yanela. I'll take your question. And as we say that we've begun a wind-down process for Assurance and have moved the results to divested businesses. First of all, let me acknowledge that these decisions are always difficult and our utmost focus is caring for the people involved. That said, this winddown will not have a material impact on earnings. Assurance has not been material to our results. We have accrued all wind-down costs this quarter in divested businesses. And we do have assets on the balance sheet, such as commission receivables, which will convert to cash over time. And beyond that, as we go through the wind-down process, we certainly will assess whether there is any incremental value to the assets and to the extent that there is, we will seek to monetize that value. Jamminder Bhullar : And I would have thought that it would be -- the exit would be slightly accretive to earnings given that Assurance IQ wasn't really making much money. And in most of the years when you were reporting it stand-alone, it was actually losing money. But is that not correct? Yanela del Frias : Well, that's the point. We had moved it to corporate other because it was not material. Now it's in divested, and it's just not material to the bottom line. Jamminder Bhullar : And then on the [ CRE ] portfolio, it seems like on commercial mortgage loans, most of the credit metrics are fairly stable with what they had been recently. But if you just talk about what's going on there and give us some insight into the percentage of loans or the number of loans that are maturing this year and what's happened with loans that have matured -- like are you having to extend more of them? Or are they just paying down? Or just anything to give us more color on how the portfolio has been performing. Robert Falzon : Okay. Jimmy, let me start at a high level and then end with your specific question on maturity. So actually, there has not been a material change from year-end. We've got a $51 billion portfolio. It's about 14% of our investments. The portfolio remains resilient. It's high quality. It's broadly diversified, looking at both geography and underlying property types. And as we pointed out before, we benefit significantly from PGIM's direct origination of these loans, their deep knowledge of local markets and the proven track record they've had through prior cycles. It's a management team with over 25 years of average industry experience. LTVs and debt service coverage ratios really did not change for the entire -- on a portfolio-wide basis from the end of year to the -- through the first quarter, we're at 58% on a loan-to-value basis and almost 2.5x on a debt service coverage ratio. The office, as you might expect, Jimmy, had some negative trends. It's just pointing out that's about $7 billion of our portfolio or about 14% of the mortgage portfolio. LTVs there were up, it gets lost in the rounding and the overall. So our -- while our LTV for the overall portfolio didn't rise within the office sector, we went up from 71% at year-end to 74%, but our coverage ratios remained the same at just over 2.5x. So feel good about where we are in the overall portfolio. From an outlook standpoint -- and I'm sorry, I'm not sure if you asked the question but reserves in the real estate portfolio, we added modestly to those from the first quarter experience. So they're up, they're at $414 million, up from about $370-plus million as of year-end. So a modest increase there. As we're looking forward, expectation across the -- sort of across industry is that there'll be another 5% to 10% valuation decline across the industry. Office is a subsector of that will probably be more like around 15% decline. And while our portfolio won't be immune to further declines in value, we do expect it to continue to be resilient, given its construction, the institutional quality of our underlying properties and the conservative loan underwriting that we've got in those LTVs and debt service coverage ratios that I shared with you. With respect to loan maturities, during 2023, we had about $2 billion worth of maturities. There were 4 modifications under $400 million of that with long-term extensions.  The remainder were resolved favorably through refinancings, payoffs or short-term extensions, which were then subsequently paid off. For the remainder of 2024, we've got $2 billion or about 4% of the portfolio that's maturing. And then years after that, think of it as about being plus or minus 10% per year, so around $5.5 billion a year through 2028. We expect that there'll be episodic issues that we'll need to deal with in the way of ongoing loan modifications and extensions. But overall, we are quite comfortable with the quality and resilience of the portfolio. Operator : Your next question is coming from Wilma Burdis from Raymond James. Wilma Jackson Burdis : Given the high level of retail sales, could you talk about the competition levels in annuity and life products? We would expect pricing to rationalize somewhat this year given regulatory changes in Bermuda. So have you seen any evidence of this? And maybe give us some broader color. Caroline Feeney-Pfundstein: Yes. So Wilma, it's Caroline. So I'll take your question. if I think about life for a moment and our sales results and our outlook going forward, I'll take that first. We are very pleased, Wilma, with our first quarter results with over $165 million in sales an increase of more than 10% from the prior year quarter. That's driven by our term and variable products, and we continue to write that new business at healthy returns continuing the trend we saw throughout the year in spite of competition. As we look to this year, we continue to see positive momentum for our portfolio. That does include core products like variable universal life and term where we are already a market leader. In addition, Wilma, and I think this is part of how we're staying ahead and continuing our market leadership position with competition as we've rolled out new solutions. Like our FlexGuard Life indexed variable universal life product to further penetrate the accumulation market and be able to reach new customers. And we achieved our highest quarterly sales of FlexGuard life this past quarter. So that we're very confident that with these products, our pricing disability, discipline, excuse me, and our distribution strength we will remain and continue to be a leader in the life market. In terms of the annuities market, yes, certainly, there is significant growth across the annuity space and increasing competition. with the record industry sales that we've seen in each of the past 2 years. But as I shared earlier, and I think this is important to reiterate, we've been able to achieve the strong results, thanks to our brand and our industry-leading execution and distribution. We've maintained a distinct focus on our end-to-end customer and adviser experiences using automation and process enhancement to make it easier than ever to buy a Prudential policy. We also have deep and expanding partnerships across multiple distribution channels. And this enables us to scale quickly to meet increased market demand and allows us to expand distribution. And finally, we combine all of that with our world-class asset management capabilities through PGIM. So we believe we're in a very strong position to continue to build on our growth and meet the market demand even with rising competition in the space. Wilma Jackson Burdis : And given the exit in Argentina, could you discuss which regions you're thinking about scaling? And more broadly, could you give us an update on the market for bolt-on opportunities? Andrew Sullivan : So Wilma, it's Andy. So our emerging market strategy is to focus on a few select high-growth geographies that offer us the opportunity for significant scale. So at this point, what I would tell you is we're in the countries that we want to be in. So there really are no direct implications from the sale of Argentina for the rest of our portfolio. And we remain highly committed to Latin America as part of our emerging market growth strategy. I think the second part of your question was around programmatic bolt-on acquisitions. Job 1 is always organic growth for us. So that's where the majority of our focus is. But we will always be in the know and in the flow of potential acquisition opportunities. But as always, we'll be patient and we'll be disciplined. Operator : We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lowrey for any further closing comments. Charles Lowrey : Okay. Thank you again for joining us today. We are pleased by the progress we've made in growing our market-leading businesses, including leveraging our mutually reinforcing business system and optimizing capital to deliver sustainable long-term growth. We will continue to lead the way in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security across the globe as we help current and future generations live better lives longer. Thank you again for joining us, and have a good day. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Later, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Bob McLaughlin. Please go ahead. Bob McLaughlin : Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential on today\u2019s call are Charlie Lowrey, Chairman and CEO; Rob Falzon, Vice Chairman; Andy Sullivan, Head of the International Businesses and PGIM, our Global Investment Manager; Caroline Feeney, Head of U.S. Businesses; Yanela Frias, Chief Financial Officer; and Rob Axel, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. We will start with prepared comments by Charlie, Rob, and Yanela, and then we will take your questions. Today\u2019s discussion may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. In addition, our presentation includes references to non-GAAP measures.

And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Charlie. Charlie Lowrey : Thank you, Bob, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. During the second quarter, we continued to grow our market-leading businesses and become more capital efficient to deliver greater long-term value for our stakeholders. Our momentum was driven by robust sales in our U.S. and International Businesses, as well as strong investment performance and originations across PGIM\u2019s Private Alternatives platform. We maintained our disciplined approach to capital deployment by investing in the growth of our businesses and returning excess capital to shareholders. This progress was supported by our strong financial position. Turning to Slide 3, I will focus my remarks this morning on the strategic actions we are taking to expand access to investing, insurance and retirement security, and how they position us to address the evolving financial challenges of our customers around the world. One of our most compelling growth opportunities is addressing the increasing global demand for retirement products, solutions, and advice. This year, historic levels of Americans will turn 65. At the same time, 55-year-olds will enter the crucial decade before retirement in preparation for life after work. These aging demographics will result in an estimated $137 trillion retirement opportunity in the U.S. and $26 trillion in Japan by 2050. As a leader in pension risk transfer and individual annuities, Retirement Strategies is delivering products and solutions that protect the life\u2019s work of our customers and ensure a more financially secure retirement for people around the world. Our market leadership is demonstrated by nearly $22 billion in Retirement Strategies sales in the first half of this year, representing a 67% increase from the prior year. This includes robust sales in pension risk and longevity risk transfer, as well as nearly doubling our individual annuity sales. Since the launch of our FlexGuard Indexed Variable Annuity product suite in 2020, our sales have exceeded $21 billion. Meanwhile, in Japan, our customers are benefiting from an expanded product suite demonstrated by a 20% increase in retirement and savings product sales year-over-year. PGIM, our global asset management business, is well-positioned to address the increasing demand for retirement solutions around the world, while capitalizing on growing institutional demand for private credit and alternative investments. PGIM provides investment solutions that help retirement plan sponsors deliver benefits to millions of beneficiaries. With nearly $0.5 trillion of assets under management supporting defined benefit and defined contribution plans, PGIM is a market leader, servicing more than half of the world\u2019s 300 largest pension funds, including over two-thirds of the largest 100 U.S. pension plans, and is the largest pension fund manager in Japan. PGIM also continues to grow its Private Alternatives business with capital deployment of nearly $11 billion in the second quarter, a 35% increase compared to a year-ago quarter. This includes the benefit of our recent acquisition of Deerpath Capital. Moving now to our market-leading insurance businesses, we have expanded our product suite and distribution channels to meet the growing demand for products and solutions that can help bridge the global life insurance gap. In our U.S. Insurance businesses, strong sales continue to benefit from expanded distribution and product diversification. This has resulted in a shift to a more capital-efficient product mix. Year-to-date, Group Insurance sales are up 13% and Individual Life sales are up 7% compared to the first half of 2023. In Brazil, we continue to expand our third-party distribution and benefit from the high quality of our life planners. This has resulted in a 27% increase in year-to-date sales. Across each of our businesses, our strategy is underpinned by the continued investment in capabilities and initiatives that translate into future earnings growth. This includes expanding our products and distribution and using artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other technology to deliver exceptional sales, service, and claims experiences. Turning to Slide 4, our disciplined approach to capital deployment supported investments in our businesses while returning over $700 million to shareholders during the quarter. Turning to Slide 5, our financial strength, diversified business mix, and risk and capital management framework supports our growth strategy. Our AA rating reflects our healthy capital position, including more than $4 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the second quarter, a high-quality, well-diversified investment portfolio, and a disciplined approach to asset liability management. We are confident that our financial strength, our business strategy and the evolving opportunities to support our customers around the world put us in a strong position to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. With that, I will turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our individual business performance. Rob Falzon : Thank you, Charlie. I\u2019ll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, U.S., and International Businesses. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 6 with our financial results for the second quarter of 2024. Our pre-tax adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion or $3.39 per share on an after-tax basis, up 10% from the year-ago quarter and 12.5% on a year-to-date basis. These results reflect the execution of our strategy to grow our market-leading businesses. Higher spread in fee income was the result of continued strong sales and the benefit of higher interest rates in equity markets. Additionally, expenses were lower and include a reduction in legal reserves. Results for the current quarter also include a modest net favorable impact from our annual assumptions update and other refinements reflecting the benefit of our diversified business mix. Year-to-date adjusted operating return on equity was 13.5% and has improved nearly 1.5 percentage points from the prior year. This reflects the strength of our businesses, the benefits from the deliberate actions we\u2019ve taken to pivot to more capital-efficient products, and operating efficiencies we\u2019ve achieved that support growth. Turning to the operating results from our businesses compared to the year-ago quarter. PGIM, our Global Investment Manager, had higher asset management fees driven by favorable investment performance, contributions from the Deerpath Capital acquisition, and equity market appreciation. Additionally, higher incentive and transaction fees resulted in an increase in other related revenues. This was partially offset by higher expenses to support business growth. Earnings growth in our U.S. businesses reflected higher spread income driven by business growth and the benefit of higher interest rates, more favorable underwriting results, and lower expenses. In addition, a more favorable relative impact from our annual assumptions update and other refinements was driven by a more favorable Retirement Strategies update partially offset by a less favorable update in Individual Life. This was partially offset by lower legacy traditional variable annuity fee income as we intentionally pivot to less market-sensitive products. Results of our International Businesses included an unfavorable relative impact from our annual assumptions update and other refinements, less favorable underwriting results, primarily reflecting policyholder behavior, and lower spread income due to less favorable variable investment income. Results in the quarter also included higher joint venture earnings. Turning to Slide 7, PGIM, our Global Investment Manager, has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, equities and alternatives. PGIM\u2019s strong investment performance continues to improve with 83% of assets under management exceeding their benchmarks over the past year. This has contributed favorably to strong long-term performance with 80% and over 90% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last five-year and 10-year periods, respectively. PGIM\u2019s assets under management increased by 5% to $1.3 trillion from the year-ago quarter driven by market appreciation, investment performance and affiliated net flows. Third-party net outflows in the quarter totaled $9.5 billion. Institutional outflows of $8.9 billion were primarily in fixed income driven by two large clients. Retail outflows of $600 million were driven by sub-advised equity strategies and mutual funds and were partially offset by positive momentum in public fixed income. PGIM third-party flows are episodic due to large single-client transactions. On a year-to-date basis, we generated $17.1 billion of inflows reflecting the net benefit from large institutional pension clients. As the investment engine of Prudential, PGIM\u2019s capabilities support the success and growth of our U.S. and International Businesses in retirement, asset management, and insurance. PGIM\u2019s asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise and access to institutional and other sources of private capital, including through the recently launched Reinsurer Prismic, are a competitive advantage, helping our businesses bring enhanced solutions and create more value for our customers. Our insurance and retirement businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated net flows, as well as unique access to insurance liabilities. In addition, our diversified PGIM Private Alternatives platform, which has assets under management of approximately $240 billion, experienced strong private credit origination activity driven by our direct lending businesses, including from our recent acquisition of Deerpath Capital. Turning to Slide 8, our U.S. businesses produce diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income, and benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to focus on growing our market-leading businesses by transforming our capabilities to improve customer experiences and expanding our addressable market with new financial solutions leveraging the capabilities across Prudential. Retirement Strategies generated strong sales of $7.5 billion in the second quarter across its institutional and individual lines of business. Institutional Retirement sales of $4 billion included U.S.-funded pension risk transfer transactions of $1.4 billion and longevity risk transfer sales of $1.2 billion. Year-to-date, Institutional Retirement has generated sales of $15 billion. Individual Retirement posted $3.5 billion in sales, its best quarter of sales in over a decade. Our product pivots have resulted in continued strong sales of FlexGuard and FlexCard Income and fixed annuity sales have doubled from the prior year. Additionally, we continue to reduce market sensitivity by running off our legacy variable annuities. Group Insurance sales primarily occur in the first quarter of the year based on annual enrollments. On a year-to-date basis, sales increased 13% compared to the prior year, driven by growth in life, disability and supplemental health. We are executing our strategy of both product and client segmentation diversification while leveraging technology to increase operating efficiency and enhance customer experience. These actions to improve profitability and performance resulted in a favorable benefit ratio of 81.1%. In Individual Life, sales increased 3% from the year-ago quarter and 7% year-to-date. These increases include the benefit from our FlexGuard Life product, which reached its highest sales quarter since its launch in 2022, and from our pivot towards more capital-efficient products. Turning to Slide 9, our International Businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multi-channel distribution model, as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in targeted high-growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high-quality service and expanding our distribution and product offerings. Our needs-based approach and protection of retirement product focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a selective portfolio of businesses and regions where customers\u2019 needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market-leading businesses, and where the financial enterprise can add value. Sales in our International Businesses were up 11% compared to the year-ago quarter. Higher sales in Japan are benefiting from recent product launches as we expand our retirement and savings offerings. These new products are gaining traction with customers and represented 20% of the current quarter sales. In addition, emerging market sales were higher, driven by growth in Brazil, as we continue to expand third-party distribution and benefit from the strong performance of our world-class life planners. As we look ahead, we are well-positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We continue to focus on investing in growth businesses and markets, delivering industry-leading customer experiences and creating the next generation of financial solutions to serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. And with that, I\u2019ll now hand it over to Yanela. Yanela Frias : Thank you, Rob. I will begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the third quarter of 2024 relative to our second quarter results. Pre-tax adjusted operating income for the second quarter was $1.6 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $3.39 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense of how our third quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items. First, our annual assumption update and other refinements resulted in a net benefit of $6 million in the second quarter. Second, variable investment income was below expectations by $90 million in the second quarter, driven by lower real estate returns. Next, underwriting experience was below expectations by $10 million in the second quarter and we expect $30 million of favorable seasonality in the third quarter. And last, we include an adjustment of $95 million for expenses and other items. Expenses in the second quarter were lower than expected, reflecting a reduction in legal reserves and the timing of expenses. As a result, we have lowered the full year 2024 expected loss in corporate and other to $1.8 billion. In the third quarter, we expect higher investments in our initiatives to support growth as originally planned. These adjustments combined get us to a baseline of $3.48 per share for third quarter. I will note that if you exclude items specific to the third quarter, earnings per share would be $3.56. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power increased and reflects our continued investment in the growth of our market-leading businesses and our pivot away from more capital intensive and lower growth businesses. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the third quarter. Turning to Slide 11, our capital position continues to support our AA financial strength rating. Our regulatory capital ratios are in excess of our AA objectives. Our cash and liquid assets were $4.4 billion, within our liquidity target range of $3 billion to $5 billion and we have substantial off-balance sheet resources. We remain thoughtful in our capital deployment, preserving financial strength and flexibility, investing in our businesses for long-term growth, and returning capital to shareholders. Turning to Slide 12, and in summary, we are growing our market-leading businesses, we are maintaining a disciplined approach to capital deployment and our growth is supported by the strength of our balance sheet. And with that, we will be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Your line is now live. Ryan Krueger : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. My first question was on Prismic. Can you give an update on your progress towards additional transactions and would you anticipate getting another one done before the end of the year? Rob Falzon : Good morning, Ryan. It\u2019s Rob. Yeah. We and our Prismic investors share aspirations to grow well beyond the initial $10 billion transaction that we completed relatively recently. We continue to work on a very active pipeline of multiple insurance transactions. That pipeline includes ongoing balance sheet optimization, flow or new sales solutions across our businesses, as well as third-party blocks where we have a particular focus on Japan. I would be -- we would be disappointed if we\u2019ve not entered into an additional transaction before year end. Ryan Krueger : Thank you. And the second one was on just hoping you could revisit your earnings sensitivity to short-term rates, and I think in addition to the total sensitivity, can you give some perspective on the different moving parts between some of the businesses? Yanela Frias : Hi, Ryan. It\u2019s Yanela. Yes. With regards to rates, short-term rates, we do not expect much of an impact due to changes in short-term rates. We have cash at the holding company and collateral in individual Retirement Strategies that earned short-term yields. And this is generally offset by interest rate derivatives where we pay short-term rates and receive fixed, and we use these to manage duration across our businesses. So generally, these are offsetting. Let me also address long-term rates since we\u2019ve seen some recent movement. With respect to long-term rates, we have benefited from the rise in rates over the past few years. We have been at levels that are significantly higher than over the past decade and this has increased our portfolio yields in both domestic and international. So higher rates are good for us and it has been a tailwind. If rates were to decline, it would reduce our new money rates, but we do have a healthy spread between our new money rates and portfolio yields. And lastly, I would point out that we have a very disciplined ALM approach which significantly reduces future spread volatility of the enforced. Ryan Krueger : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Suneet Kamath : Good morning. Thank you. I guess last quarter you guys were pretty optimistic about the industry annuity sales. I think you said over $400 billion, and year-to-date, that\u2019s tracking pretty closely, so that\u2019s good. I guess my question is, given the moving rates that we\u2019ve seen, with the 10-year now, somewhere in the 3.8-yerar neighborhood, do you think that will dampen demand for annuity growth and how are you thinking about pricing in this if this becomes the new kind of rate environment? Thanks. Caroline Feeney : Yeah. So, Suneet, it\u2019s Caroline, and I\u2019ll take your question. So, right now, the annuity market continues to be extremely strong, as you referenced, with the market on pace to deliver a third straight record year, outpacing last year\u2019s run rate by over 20%. It\u2019s certainly possible that in a decreasing interest rate environment, we could see some pullback from the record sales levels, particularly in fixed annuities. From a Prudential perspective, while we\u2019ve been very pleased with the growth in our fixed annuity sales, for us, it\u2019s really just a piece of the overall portfolio. We have the broadest product portfolio we\u2019ve ever had, with no overconcentration in any single product. In fact, this past quarter, we had record sales in three distinct products, and two of those products are in our RILA suite of solutions, which are actually less sensitive to interest rates. And Suneet, this really reflects our very deliberate strategy, which enables us to serve the broadest set of customers across all market conditions. Frankly, we\u2019re also very excited about the broader retirement opportunity. We do see strengthening tailwinds from rapid growth in the population of Americans over age 65, and as well as increased demand for solutions that protect retirement savings and provide lifetime income. So, we believe customer demand for protected income will continue to be the driving force behind growth over the long-term and we\u2019re well positioned to meet that demand with our diverse portfolio of solutions and the strength of our brand and distribution. Finally, Suneet, you asked a question about pricing. We are also very well positioned to continue with our pricing discipline, which we have the ability to adapt pricing and enter the market with revised pricing in very short order, which enables us to be very nimble with changing markets. Suneet Kamath : Okay. That makes sense. Thanks for that. And then, I guess, for Rob, on Prismic again, you said that you\u2019d be disappointed if you didn\u2019t do something this year. Should we think about the sort of first deal that you do? Should that be on the smaller side as sort of a proof of concept deal or is that not the way that you\u2019re thinking about it? Thanks. Rob Falzon : So, Suneet, so it would actually be the second deal. So, the first transaction we closed was about $10 billion in reserves and so relatively significant in size. For the next transaction, I would -- what I would say is that, the nature of underlying liabilities is what impacts the sizing of the transaction and that\u2019s going to be dependent upon sort of market sensitivity, hedging and collateral needs. So, we\u2019re not constraining it simply because of appetite or access to capital or other capabilities. It would really just be a function of making sure that as we\u2019re constructing the Prismic portfolio, it all fits together well. Suneet Kamath : And are you leaning one way or the other in terms of the different uses? Like, you\u2019ve talked about flow, you\u2019ve talked about your own in-force, you\u2019ve talked about third party. Is there one way that you\u2019re leaning in particular on that? Rob Falzon : Well, I would say, we -- the continued balance sheet optimization is probably our highest priority, Suneet, and incidentally, the most controllable of the things that we\u2019re working on. But both flow and third-party are high priorities for us, and they are being actively worked as well. Suneet Kamath : Okay. Thanks, Rob. Rob Falzon : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Elyse Greenspan : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question is on PGIM. I know you guys had called out two large pension outflows in the quarter, but I was hoping to just get more color on trends and flows, both on the institutional and retail side, and how you think about the outlook for the balance of the year. Andy Sullivan : Sure. Good morning, Elyse. It\u2019s Andy. I\u2019ll take that. So our flows in PGIM have become more variable. This is mostly driven on the institutional side of the business, so let me start there. We\u2019re the sixth largest manager of defined benefit assets globally, and we have very large strategic pension clients.\\ If you look at many of these defined benefit portfolios as we sit here today are overfunded and those clients are either derisking or they\u2019re exploring PRT. So, as a result, we\u2019re seeing more than normal institutional money in motion, leading to a variability in our institutional flows. Overall, we expect that in PGIM, we\u2019ll be a beneficiary of that environment, given our world-class fixed income solutions and our leading PRT business. If you take a step back, though, and look across the year, last quarter you saw us benefit with noteworthy PRT wins and a large pension mandate inflow. This quarter, we saw fixed income outflows as a few of our clients de-risked and moved. But the important part is, when you look across the year, our institutional flows are positive year-to-date at $17 billion. On the retail side of the business, we have experienced large improvement versus last year. Year-to-date, our flows are flat, and that is a market improvement. We\u2019re starting to see flows back into our fixed income retail products with $1.1 billion in positive inflow this quarter. We believe this is poised to accelerate once clients start to move to $6 trillion that\u2019s sitting in money market assets over into longer-term active products and we expect that declining rates are going to be the trigger to that action. So the punchline overall, from a flows perspective, is we expect that we will remain a net winner over the long-term, but you should expect near-term variability. It will continue in this environment. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks. And then my second question was on the group side. Results there were pretty strong. Just anything you\u2019re calling one-off there? And then how should we think about the benefits ratio trending in that business over the balance of the year? Caroline Feeney : Sure. Elyse, it\u2019s Caroline, and I\u2019ll take your question. There\u2019s really none -- nothing that\u2019s one-off, Elyse. It was really very much core strength in the business, which was driven by a few different factors. First of all, we continue to see strong life and group disability results driven by favorable mortality and by our focus on effective claims management, which is an area we continue to invest in. We also continue to see strong double-digit growth in our supplemental health business, which is a core component of our diversification strategy. And we\u2019ve also seen growth in our under-5,000 lives and our association market segments, helping us further broaden our portfolio. So, overall, Elyse, the business is growing, and it\u2019s doing so at attractive margins. In terms of your question on the benefit ratio, we delivered a very strong result coming in at 81% in line with a year-ago quarter and below our target range of 83% to 87%. Given that we have been below our target range for the first half of the year, you can expect for the year we would be towards the lower end of that target range. Elyse Greenspan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Wesley Carmichael from Autonomous Research. Your line is now live. Wesley Carmichael : Good morning. Thank you. On Individual Life, I was hoping you could touch on the assumption review impact, what drove that unfavorable in the quarter and do you think there\u2019s an ongoing impact to either earnings or cash flow? Yanela Frias : Hi, Wes. This is Yanela. So, let me take your question. I mean, to take it a step up, the annual assumption update this quarter had a modest benefit to adjusted operating income, as you saw, and this is a result of our multiline business mix that generally creates risk diversification and tends to moderate the annual assumption update impact. So the net modest benefit was due to favorable mortality updates for the Institutional Retirement Strategies, partially offset by unfavorable policyholder behavior updates for both Individual Life and Japan. And to your question about what drove the large impact to Individual Life, the negative impact to Individual Life was primarily due to lower guaranteed universal life surrender experience post-COVID as individuals retain their life-insuring policies at higher levels than previously assumed. And this was based on our examination of updated emerging experience data of our business and information available from a number of industry studies. So that is what drove the assumption update, and we do have a small ongoing impact from the assumption update as well. Wesley Carmichael : Yeah. That\u2019s helpful, Yanela. And is that ongoing impact? Is that an operating earnings impact or is there any statutory impact on that? Yanela Frias : So there\u2019s an ongoing operating income perspective. From a statutory perspective, the assumption update there, we have a process from a process standpoint that is done at the end of the year. So that will be reflected in our statutory results at the end of the year. Having said that, any impacts are not expected to be meaningful to our assessment of capital availability, cash flows or our capital deployment plans. Wesley Carmichael : No. That\u2019s great. Thank you. And then maybe my follow-up, on variable investment income, I think some of your competitors this quarter have talked about an expectation for real estate equity returns to improve in the back half of the year. So just curious if you guys have the same outlook or not? Rob Falzon : It\u2019s Rob. I\u2019ll take that question. I would say that if we look at the industry from an overall basis, our real estate investment group has a forecast that there will be actually continued valuation declines through the remainder of the year across the industry. Those valuation declines, though, will be in the low-single digits. So while we think we\u2019re close to an inflection point where that could begin to turn around, we\u2019re not quite sure we\u2019re at the trough of that yet. Wesley Carmichael : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Rob. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. Tom Gallagher : Good morning. Just a follow-up on that actuarial review. I think most of the $800 million or so net income release from the review came from RILA. Would you mind just sort of, A, is that correct, and, B, can you talk about what drove the change, was that a utilization assumption changes, and will that be a gap-only impact or will there be a statutory impact as well? Yanela Frias : Yes, Tom. It\u2019s Yanela. So, yes, the non-AOI impact was mainly due to RILA, and it was really driven by a methodology update to the annuity valuation, and this is really to be consistent with industry standard and also more consistent with how we actually manage the product. So it\u2019s a valuation methodology change. It is GAAP-only, so we will not see a comparable statutory impact and that is just following the normal variable annuity reserving and capital standards. Tom Gallagher : Got you. Okay. Thanks. And then my follow-up is, can you just comment on what caused some of the weakness in Institutional Retirement this quarter? Was it spreads, underwriting, expenses? And how do you feel about earnings visibility going forward in that business? Caroline Feeney : Yes. So, Tom, it\u2019s Caroline. So, we actually don\u2019t see much weakness in the earnings, especially given both reported and core earnings are up this quarter compared to the prior year quarter. If I just take the institutional side of the business for a moment, it does take time to see the impact from a risk transfer transaction materialize in our earnings. So in essence, Tom, sales leads, and then obviously earnings will follow. We had $4 billion in sales this past quarter and we believe that rapidly growing demand for pension derisking in the U.S. and our International markets will continue to fuel profitable growth. We did see some less favorable underwriting this quarter as well as lower VII on the institutional side. And then on the individual side, Tom, there are two key drivers of our core earnings. First, I would point to the strong sales we\u2019re driving through our expanded portfolio, which includes our RILA or Fix Products. And this past quarter, as you heard, was especially strong, our best quarter in over a decade. The higher sales volumes across these products will also drive future profitability, but over the near-term, those profits are tempered by the higher up-front distribution costs associated with those higher sales levels. And then second, there\u2019s the impact from our decision to no longer sell traditional variable annuities with living benefit guarantees. While this business continues to generate strong fee income, it will run off at roughly $3 billion to $4 billion per quarter, offsetting some of the earnings growth from our new business. But we see this largely as a transition. Ultimately, we like the business we\u2019re putting on and those strong sales are contributing higher quality earnings. But you\u2019re still going to see an impact from the intentional runoff of our traditional variable annuity block. Tom Gallagher : Got you. Thanks, Caroline. Caroline Feeney : Thanks, Tom. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler. Your line is now live. John Barnidge : Good morning. Appreciate the opportunity. Can you talk about growth in the group channel and how much of that\u2019s coming from at this point employee growth versus wage and then adding more coverage? Thanks. Caroline Feeney : Sure. John, it\u2019s Caroline. I\u2019ll take your question. So the growth in our book continues to be primarily driven by the execution of our diversification strategy, which is focused on growing in the under 5,000 lives market, as well as our focus on further diversifying in disability and supplemental health products. We\u2019re certainly benefiting from strong employment, John, which is driving overall employee and wage growth and will continue to grow organically in the block. However, when you look at what is primarily driving our growth, it is more driven by the strong underlying fundamentals and executing on our strategy. So hopefully that helps you. I would also say one more thing in terms of our strategy. We\u2019ve also made a lot of progress on diversification in our under 5,000 market, which spreads our premiums out more across the year. So we\u2019re continuing to like what we see in our diversification. John Barnidge : Thank you. My follow-up question is on the comment about building a select portfolio in International markets. I know you\u2019re focused on where you want to be. What does the opportunity set look like internationally, and is there an opportunity to accelerate that through M&A? Thank you. Andy Sullivan : So, John, it\u2019s Andy. I\u2019ll take the question. Yeah. And as you said, our strategy in emerging markets or in International in general is to accelerate our growth through a select set of emerging markets by extending our leadership position in Latin America, by strengthening our footprint in emerging Asia, and in particular in India and Indonesia, and by investing in market leaders in Africa. I mean, I think the important thing here is, you\u2019re already seeing very, very strong good growth in Brazil that is leading to healthy earnings growth in that block of business. Many of these other markets offer us very good opportunity, but they will take time to develop. So this is about the medium- and long-term as well. As far as M&A, we are absolutely open to opportunistic, programmatic M&A to help us accelerate our growth in those markets. But as always, organic growth is going to be job one for us. We\u2019re confident that over time, emerging markets will become a bigger part of the Prudential pie. John Barnidge : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Jimmy Bhullar : I had a question for Yanela or maybe for Rob just on capital deployment. Your cash flows and capital levels are obviously pretty strong, yet buybacks have been fairly modest relative to most of your peers, even as stock trades at a relatively low multiple. So I\u2019m just wondering if you could talk about your appetite for buybacks versus other uses of capital. Yanela Frias : Hey, Jimmy. It\u2019s Yanela. So, look, we remain well capitalized. You saw PICA\u2019s RBC ratio in excess of our AA objective of 375. We are positioned to continue to invest in the growth of our businesses and you\u2019ve seen that year-to-date where we\u2019ve closed three large PRT transactions exceeding $10 billion in liabilities and we\u2019ve funded strong growth across all of our businesses. And even with that, we continue to pay dividends out of our insurance subsidiaries, and our highly liquid assets increased a bit, as you mentioned. But we will remain thoughtful in our capital deployment. We will remain focused on preserving financial strength and flexibility, investing in our businesses for long-term growth where we see a lot of opportunities and then returning capital to shareholders. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. Thanks. And if I could just ask about your views on the sales outlook for the Japanese business. Just given the high volatility in the yen, I think, that\u2019s depressing demand for some Forex products there. But how are you thinking about your trends in your business in Japan and just the sales outlook in that market? Andy Sullivan : Yeah. Jimmy, it\u2019s Andy. I\u2019ll take the question. Maybe let me just start by saying we\u2019re very, very pleased with the sales results that we saw. We experienced strong year-over-year growth in our life planner, independent agent and bank channels. And sales in Japan were up 10% year-over-year. That is really flowing from our work to continue to broaden and innovate our product portfolio and to enhance the customer experience in our business. The fact is, in that 10% year-over-year up, 20% of our sales this quarter flowed from more recent product introductions, including both life and annuity products, and we\u2019ve been expanding our yen offerings in addition to our U.S. dollar offerings. Obviously, we are -- we see effects from the yen strengthening and weakening. Lately here, with the strength we\u2019ve seen, we think that will be a benefit to our U.S. dollar products as it will make them more affordable for the consumer. Japanese consumers are still absolutely interested in taking advantage of the U.S. interest rates. So we\u2019re pleased with the yen movement this week, we\u2019re pleased with the work that we\u2019ve done and the results we\u2019ve shown and we expect to continue the good sales trend. Jimmy Bhullar : And is competition in that market fairly rational, because we\u2019ve heard from some of your peers that it\u2019s a much more competitive market than it used to be a few years ago? Andy Sullivan : Yeah. Jimmy, I start by saying all the businesses we compete in are competitive, but I would say, yes, the marketplace is rational. At times, you may see a competitor get aggressive, but overall we see it as a rational market with a good ability for us to derive and drive profitability. And we\u2019re competitively advantaged with broad product portfolio, differentiated distribution and a good brand. So, the last thing I always reinforce is we\u2019ll be disciplined no matter what the competition does and make sure that we deliver for the customer and the shareholder. Jimmy Bhullar : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Michael Ward from Citi. Your line is now live. Michael Ward : Thanks, guys. Good morning. I was wondering the -- I was wondering if you have any sense on the individualized charge. I was wondering if you have any sense of, like, how that would have looked had you not done the GUL deal. And I guess I\u2019m curious, like, if these types of reserve actions or assumption updates, does that keep you in the market for further risk transfer opportunities? Yanela Frias : So, Mike, this is Yanela, let me take your question. So, obviously, we executed on the transaction earlier this year. We don\u2019t have a sense of what the impact would have been. So that said, in terms of further derisking transactions, we always are looking at options and opportunities to the extent they are available. Michael Ward : Okay. And then I noticed the disclosure for PGIM. I think part of the outflow or the reduction in AUM was that you moved a quant fund to run-off. I was wondering if you could expand on that and if that contributed to the investment performance in the quarter pressure? Andy Sullivan : So, it\u2019s Andy. I\u2019ll take the question. I\u2019ll take that in two parts. First, the quant manager where you\u2019re referring to is not a material part of our business. It had less than a $1 billion in assets under management and it\u2019s a subcomponent on the quantitative equity side that we\u2019re exploring strategically what we want to do with the capability. But as far as you referenced investment performance, we\u2019re actually quite pleased with our investment performance in the business. Obviously, that is job one. It\u2019s the most critical ingredient. And if you look at our short-term and long-term results, they have been very, very strong and we remain confident in our ability to continue that track. But as far as that block of business, it\u2019s small, not material to the overall business. Michael Ward : Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. We reach the end of our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over for any further closing comments. Charlie Lowrey : Sure. This is Charlie. Let me make an observation, if I may, before the closing comments, and that we are experiencing very turbulent times right now, obviously, and this is exactly when clients need us the most. And we\u2019ve seen that in the past when clients turn to us during these kind of volatile times, such as the great financial crisis and others that we\u2019ve all been through. And what we\u2019ve observed is that we\u2019ve been a net beneficiary in these turbulent times, as there is a real flight to quality, which we define as having the financial strength, the strength of brand and the strength of distribution so that clients can meet us when, where and how they want. Now, obviously, past isn\u2019t prologue, but I\u2019ll make the following observation, and that is that we have exactly the capabilities that clients need in terms of investing, insurance and retirement security, and that we will be laser-focused during these times in helping them as they map through this volatility. So we\u2019ll continue to focus on our clients and we\u2019ll continue to deliver sustainable value to all our stakeholders as we go forward. So, thanks, and have an enjoyable weekend. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

And now, I'll turn it over to Charlie. Charlie Lowrey : Thank you, Bob, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Our third quarter performance reflects continued positive momentum in growing our businesses, increasing capital efficiency, and pivoting our product suite to address the investing, insurance, and retirement needs of our customers and clients around the world. We reported robust sales across our U.S. and international insurance and retirement businesses as well as strong investment performance and private credit originations in PGIM. We also maintained our disciplined approach to capital deployment, while continuing to invest in our businesses and returning excess capital to shareholders. Our strategic progress and performance are backed by our financial strength. Turning to Slide 3. This morning, I will highlight how we continue to become a higher-growth, more capital-efficient company. We are growing our market-leading businesses while increasing our capital flexibility. Let's start by taking a closer look at how our Retirement Strategies business is benefiting from the global retirement opportunity. On the Institutional side, our continued leadership in pension risk transfer was reinforced through a second transaction with IBM, this time to reinsure $6 billion of pension liabilities. With this latest transaction, we have now closed seven out of the 10 largest pension risk transfer deals in the U.S. On the Individual side, five of our annuity products have exceeded $1 billion in sales so far this year, validating our product diversification strategy. Our Japan business is another great example of how we are addressing the growing demand for retirement products. While life insurance has traditionally comprised the bulk of our business in Japan, year-to-date sales of retirement and savings products are up 30% compared to the prior year. Meanwhile, PGIM is well-positioned to help plan sponsors deliver benefits to millions of retirement beneficiaries through its diversified investment solutions. As a market leader, with nearly $0.5 trillion of assets under management supporting defined benefit and defined contribution plans, PGIM serves more than half of the world's 300 largest pension funds. Now, let's look at how we are further growing our market-leading businesses by diversifying our products and expanding our global distribution networks. In our Retirement Strategies business, we're increasing the number of individual annuity solutions and adding new workplace partnerships, like the relationship we recently announced with JPMorgan Asset Management. In our Group Insurance business, we are expanding our disability and supplemental health products and growing our position in the under 5,000 lives and association market segments. Turning to our Individual Life business. We continue to launch innovative, more capital-efficient products, and we have positive momentum across our distribution channels. In our International Businesses, we're benefiting from recent product launches and our strong multi-channel distribution in both, Japan and Brazil. And lastly, PGIM continues to benefit from our deeply connected and reinforcing business mix, resulting in strong affiliated flows on a year-to-date basis. In addition, private alternatives capital deployment has increased 24% year-to-date, underscoring the demand in the market and PGIM's private credit capabilities. PGIM is also well-positioned to continue to capture the growing retail demand for fixed-income products. In addition, our investments in technology across our insurance, retirement and asset management businesses is helping us to deliver exceptional sales, service, and claims experiences, supporting our growth strategy. At the same time, we're improving the quality of earnings from the continued shift of our business mix. This quarter, we announced a transaction with Wilton Re to reinsure an $11 billion guaranteed universal life block. Following this transaction, we will have reduced our guaranteed universal life reserves by 60%, advancing our strategic progress to become a higher-growth, more capital-efficient company. Turning to Slide 4. Our continued investments in our businesses are supported by our disciplined approach to capital deployment, which included returning more than $700 million to shareholders during the third quarter. Turning to Slide 5. Our growth strategy is further supported by our financial strength and our risk and capital management framework. We maintain a AA rating which reflects a healthy capital position, including more than $4 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the third quarter. We also maintain a well-diversified, high-quality portfolio and disciplined approach to Asset-Liability Management. In closing, we're operating from a position of strength with confidence in our strategy, our capabilities and our path to deliver long-term sustainable value for all our stakeholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob. Bob McLaughlin : Thanks, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, U.S. and international businesses. I'll begin on Slide 6 with our financial results. Our pretax adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion or $3.48 per share on an after-tax basis for the third-quarter of 2024 and $9.98 on a year-to-date basis, which is up 6%. These results reflect the execution of our strategy to grow our market-leading businesses and were driven by higher spread and fee income due to continued strong sales and the benefit of higher interest rates and equity markets, net of increased expenses to support the growth of our businesses. Year-to-date adjusted operating return-on-equity of 13.7% has improved a 0.5 percentage point from the prior year. This reflects the strength of our businesses, the benefits from the deliberate actions we have taken to pivot to more capital-efficient and higher-growth products. Turning to the operating results from our businesses compared to the year-ago quarter. PGIM, our global investment manager, had higher asset management fees driven by favorable investment performance, contributions from the Deerpath Capital acquisition and market appreciation. This was partially offset by higher expenses to support business growth. Earnings growth in our U.S. businesses reflected more favorable underwriting results from better-than-expected mortality experience in individual life and higher spread income driven by business growth and the benefit of higher interest rates. This was partially offset by lower legacy traditional variable annuity fee income as we intentionally pivot to less market-sensitive products as well as higher expenses to support business growth. Results of our international businesses included less favorable underwriting results, primarily reflecting elevated U.S. dollar product surrenders with the weakness in the yen and higher expenses to support business growth, partially offset by higher joint-venture earnings driven by Encaje performance in Chile and higher spread income due to higher yields from the reinvestment of the portfolio. Turning to Slide 7. PGIM, our global investment manager, has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed-income, equities and alternatives. PGIM's strong investment performance continues to improve with 86% of assets under management exceeding their benchmarks over the past year. This has contributed favorably to strong long-term performance with 79% and 85% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last five and 10-year periods, respectively. PGM's assets under management increased by 15% to $1.4 trillion from the year-ago quarter, driven by market appreciation, investment performance and net flows. Total net flows in the quarter of $3.2 billion included affiliated net flows of $6.4 billion, driven by strong retirement strategy sales, partially offset by $3.2 billion of third-party net outflows. On a year-to-date basis, total net flows were $29 billion, including $15 billion in affiliated flows and $14 billion from third-party clients. These inflows reflect the net benefit from large episodic institutional pension plan activity. As the investment engine of Prudential, PGIM's capabilities support the success and growth of our U.S. and international businesses in retirement, asset management and insurance. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise and access to institutional and other sources of private capital, including through our sponsored reinsurer Prismic are a competitive advantage, helping our businesses bring enhanced solutions and create more value for our customers. Our insurance and retirement businesses in-turn provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated net flows as well as unique access to insurance liabilities. In addition, our diversified PGIM private alternatives platform, which has assets under management of over $250 billion, experienced strong private credit origination activity driven by our direct lending businesses, including the benefit from our recent acquisition of Capital. Turning to Slide 8. Our U.S. businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income and benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses and diversified sources of earnings. We continue to focus on growing our market-leading businesses by expanding our addressable market with new financial solutions delivered through a broader distribution footprint, leveraging capabilities across Prudential and enhancing those capabilities to improve the experience of our customers and distribution partners while driving operating efficiencies. Retirement strategies generated strong sales of nearly $15 billion in the third-quarter across its institutional and individual lines of business. Institutional retirement sales totaled $11 billion in the quarter. U.S. funded pension risk transfer transactions of $6.3 billion included the second PRT transaction with IBM. Additionally, longevity risk transfer sales totaled $2.8 billion for the quarter. Year-to-date, institutional retirement sales were over $26 billion as we have captured about 40% of the PRT market. Individual Retirement posted $3.6 billion in sales, its best quarter of sales in over a decade. Our product pivots and innovation have resulted in continued strong sales of our registered index-linked annuities and fixed annuity products have more than doubled from the prior year. Additionally, we continue to reduce market sensitivity by running off our legacy variable annuities. Group Insurance sales primarily occur in the first quarter of the year based on annual enrollments. On a year-to-date basis, sales increased 3% compared to the prior year, driven by growth in supplemental health. We are executing our strategy of both product and client segment diversification, while leveraging technology to increase operating efficiency and enhance the customer experience. These actions to improve profitability and performance resulted in a benefits ratio of 83.4%, which is at the low end of our target range. In Individual Life, sales increased 13% from the year ago quarter and 9% year-to-date. These increases include the benefit from the strength and breadth of our distribution capabilities and expansion of our product offerings, including our pivot towards more capital-efficient products like FlexGuard Life, which reached its highest sales quarter since its launch in 2022. Turning to Slide 9. Our international businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in targeted high-growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high-quality service and expanding our distribution and product offerings. Our needs-based selling approach and protection and retirement product focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we extend our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a selective portfolio of businesses in regions where customer needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market-leading businesses and where the Prudential enterprise can add value. Sales in our international businesses were up 25% compared to the year-ago quarter. Higher sales in Japan are benefiting from recent product launches as we expand our retirement and savings offerings, which are gaining traction with customers and represented 75% of the current quarter sales. In addition, emerging market sales were also higher, driven by growth in Brazil as we continue to expand third-party distribution and benefit from the strong performance of our world-class Life Planners. As we look ahead, we are well-positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We continue to focus on investing in growth businesses and markets delivering industry-leading customer and client experiences and creating the next-generation of financial solutions to serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. And with that, I'll now hand it over to Yanela. Yanela Frias : Thank you, Rob. I will begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the fourth quarter of 2024 relative to our third quarter results. Pre-tax adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $1.6 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $3.48 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense of how our fourth quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items. First, variable investment income was below expectations by $50 million in the third quarter, driven by lower private equity returns. Beginning next quarter, we plan to pre-announce our estimated variable investment income results. Next, underwriting experience was above expectations by $15 million in the third quarter. And last, we include an adjustment of $100 million for expenses and other items. Higher expenses in the third quarter reflect the timing of investments in enterprise initiatives to support growth. We expect higher initiative investments to continue in the fourth quarter and maintain the full year 2024 expected loss in Corporate & Other of $1.8 billion. We also expect seasonally lower annual premiums of $50 million in international in the fourth quarter. These adjustments combined get us to a baseline of $3.34 per share for the fourth quarter. I will note that if you exclude items specific to the fourth quarter, earnings per share would be $3.67. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power increased and reflects the improved quality of earnings from intentionally shifting our business mix and continued investment in the growth of our market-leading businesses. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the future. A few items that I would highlight. We continue to benefit from new money rates that were higher than our portfolio yield in the third quarter, and we do not expect a significant impact from the potential decline in short-term rates. We have cash at the holding company, floating rate assets across our businesses and collateral in Individual Retirement Strategies that earn short-term yields, which is generally offset by interest-rate derivatives that manage duration across our businesses where we pay short-term rates and receive fixed. The earnings benefit from the recent pension risk transfer transactions grows over time as we reposition the investment portfolio and is viewed by In-Force runoff. In addition, our legacy variable annuities In-Force is running off at $3 billion to $4 billion per quarter and we have been experiencing an elevated level of surrenders in our businesses in Japan associated with U.S. dollar products as the yen has weakened relative to the U.S. dollar. The exchange rate hit a 38-year low in the second quarter. And while we have experienced a reduction in surrender levels as the yen strengthened during the third quarter, we expect some continued near-term pressure on earnings before surrenders normalized. Also of note, in order to provide greater insight into our financial outlook and to better align with the longer-term nature of our business, we plan to introduce new intermediate-term financial targets. These targets will replace our quarterly baseline disclosure concurrent with the release of our fourth quarter earnings results. Turning to Slide 11. Our regulatory capital ratios are strong and above levels that we believe represent AA financial strength as we continue to maintain margins to support strong organic growth prospects and are prepared for the potential impacts of market-driven volatility. Our cash and liquid assets were $4.3 billion, which is above our minimum liquidity target of $3 billion and we have substantial off-balance sheet resources. We remain thoughtful in our capital deployment, preserving financial strength and flexibility, investing in our businesses for long-term growth and returning capital to shareholders. Turning to Slide 12, and in summary, we are becoming a higher growth, more capital-efficient company. We are maintaining a disciplined approach to capital deployment and our growth is supported by the strength of our balance sheet. And with that, we will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Your line is now live. Ryan Krueger : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I guess one question and kind of a related follow-up would be, one, can you give an update on Prismic and potential activity there? And then the second one was just how you plan to use capital that you free up from both, external and internal reinsurance transactions going forward? Because I think you freed up some capital from various transactions, but what are your key priorities for returning that over time? RobFalzon: Ryan, it's Rob. I'll take the first part of your question and I think Charlie will probably jump in and handle the second part of that. So, I guess what I'd start with, Ryan, is that I would reiterate what we said last quarter, which is we'd be disappointed if we've not entered into an additional transaction that we could announce before year-end. We're continuing our work on a very active pipeline. It's got multiple reinsurance transactions across a spectrum of types, so it's ongoing looking at our own balance sheet optimization. It's looking at opportunities for flow or new sales financing as well as third-party blocks and there we have a particular focus on Japan. And as you may have seen, we actually made -- Prismic actually made an announcement that we've stood up a dedicated licensed team in Tokyo in order to be able to advance that opportunity. While they're all in play, I think we would say that the likely next transaction is going to be back-book amongst the variety of things that we're working on and potentially in Japan. The interest in that is in particularly that it would help establish the plumbing and the precedent for doing third-party transactions from that market, which is a -- we think is an interesting market in which we have a competitive advantage. If I was stepping back, Ryan, I would say we have a visible pipeline. We have capital available to us. We've got the right underwriting expertise and the staffing at Prismic. And all of that combines to give us confidence in our ability to scale Prismic in a way that's consistent with our aspirations and the aspirations of our investors. Charlie Lowrey : And Ryan, this is Charlie. Let me add on to what Rob said in terms of capital deployment. You know, we've always said that we want to be good stewards of capital and that we have a consistent disciplined and balanced approach to the redeployment of that capital with our businesses and to our shareholders and there are really three aspects to our approach on which we focus. The first is just maintaining our rock-solid balance sheet and financial strength, which is fundamental to us in terms of fulfilling our promises, which we've done for almost 150 years. The second is investing, both organically and through programmatic acquisitions to support the sustainable long-term growth of our businesses. And finally, returning excess capital to shareholders as we've done in the past. And in this quarter, we deployed capital to support strong sales across our businesses, including several new products to meet the evolving needs of our customers, and we returned over $700 million to shareholders. So we have a consistent process and we're going to follow that through. Ryan Krueger : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Suneet Kamath : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to start with Japan. Can you talk about how the margins or the returns on this -- these retirement products that you're selling compare to the protection products, death protection products that you used to sell? I mean, my recollection is those death protection products had very attractive margins and I just want to get a sense of the new business that you're writing and how that compares. Andy Sullivan : Yes. Suneet. Good morning. It's Andy. I'll take the question. So we're pleased with the profitability of the sales that we're seeing in Japan and we do not expect an impact on the margins given the mix-shift between the product types. We're actually quite excited. We see a long-term opportunity to help the citizens in Japan prepare for and enjoy their retirement. Given the longevity aspects of Japan and the low bank savings yields, we believe that we're going to see a continued strengthening of demand for a broader set of retirement products. While we already have a broad product portfolio there, we've been methodically diversifying and expanding our capabilities to really lean into this opportunity and you saw that success of that strategy in third quarter with our retirement investment product sales increasing about 30% year-to-date versus the prior year. And those sales accounted for the majority of Japan sales in the quarter. So, we don't expect an impact on the margin given that mix shift and we're very excited as we see this as early days and what should be a very long-term opportunity tailwind. Suneet Kamath : Okay. That makes sense. Thanks for that. And then I guess for Caroline, it looks like your prediction that 2024 would be another record year for annuity sales is playing out. Just curious if you can give some color around like where the growth is kind of coming from? Is it coming out of 401(k) plan rollovers or product exchanges? And how sustainable do you think this level of sales is as we think about moving into 2025? Thanks. Caroline Feeney : Yes, sure. Thanks for your question, Suneet. So first of all, let me say, we are extremely pleased with our individual retirement results. And as you saw in the third quarter, we drove over $3.5 billion of sales, making it our best quarter in over a decade. And this strong performance is the direct result of our efforts over the past few years to diversify our annuity portfolio, allowing us to meet more of the consumer need for protected savings and income. In fact, we now have the broadest individual product portfolio we've ever had. And to put that in perspective, Suneet, as Charlie mentioned in his opening comments, just two years ago, we had only one-product that generated over $1 billion in sales. Now we already have five products that have exceeded that mark this year. So in terms of your question on sustainability, the outlook for our individual annuity franchise remained strong. Beyond our diversified portfolio, what we see is a clear tailwind coming from aging demographics. That's over 11,000 Americans turning 65 every day and 30 million Americans turning 65 between now and 2030. So a lot of that growth to need is coming from that tailwind. And we're also seeing increased demand in the marketplace for protected savings and income solutions. So combining those factors, the industry is on pace for a third sequential record-setting sales year as you say, with year-to-date sales outpacing last year by more than 25%. And we'll meet that demand head-on with our diverse portfolio of solutions and the strength of our brand and our distribution. Suneet Kamath : Got it. Okay. Thanks for that. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. Tom Gallagher : Good morning. First question back on Japan. Can you talk about your sales mix between yen products' foreign currency products? I know foreign currency has been a big part of what's gone on, but just given the move higher in rates in Japan as -- or are you starting to see a pivot back into yen-oriented products? And how do you see that going forward? Thanks. Andy Sullivan : Yes, Tom, it's Andy. I'll take the question. So in the third quarter, we saw about 30% of our sales in Japan were yen-based sales. The fact is our level of yen-based sales has nearly doubled over the last three years and this has been based on what have been a series of very intentional actions on our part. You know, we believe in having a broadly diversified product portfolio in every geography that we operate. So for Japan, that means having good diversification across life insurance, retirement and savings products and having a nice balance between U.S. dollar and yen offerings. So, we've been intentionally strengthening the choices of our -- that our customers have for yen-based products over the last year or so. And these new product introductions have been a material contributor to the 29% year-over-year sales increase. So we believe in a broad portfolio. We've been expanding the yen-based offerings and we're seeing the success of that strategy. Tom Gallagher : Got you. Thanks. And then my follow-up is, I guess a broader industry question, but I think Swiss Re Research Institute put out a report recently on how they expect excess mortality to persist for another 5 to 10 years. And you know, hard to know exactly what the degrees they're referring to is, but is that -- is that -- and particularly if it mentioned the U.S. and Japan, which are obviously two big exposures for Pru. Curious, do you share that view broadly speaking, if that does come to pass, do you feel like you have enough prudence in your reserves to handle it? And any additional thoughts you would have on that topic? Thanks. Yanela Frias : Hi, Tom, it's Yanela. And let me take that question. So yes, the observations and the expectations from the report are consistent with our internal view and with the approach that we have taken for our mortality assumptions. So our assumptions reflect some continued excess mortality through 2028 before returning to the pre-pandemic trend line. And obviously, we regularly monitor mortality trends in advances and adjust accordingly every year during our annual assumption process in the second quarter. I would remind you that we have a diversified mix of businesses providing natural mortality hedges, right? So life insurance and PRT and also throughout globally within the U.S. and other significant insurance markets such as Japan and the U.K. And so a few data points on what we are seeing. In individual life, we have experienced mortality that is broadly in line with expectations since updating our mortality base table assumptions in 2022 and this quarter we saw favorable experience. Now the individual life insured population is less impacted by COVID than the general population. Our PRT mortality experience has trended heavier in 2023 that is consistent with continued excess mortality. And what I would say is that, our PRT population tends to be more closely correlated to the general population. Tom Gallagher : That's great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Nick Annitto from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Nick Annitto : Hi, good morning. Thanks. I just wanted to hit on PGIM first. Maybe could you talk about what went on institutional in the quarter, what drove the outflows and maybe how you're expecting them to come into '25? I mean, I know it's episodic, but any color there would be helpful. Thanks. Andy Sullivan : Sure, Nick. It's Andy. And let me actually comment on institutional and retail. So starting on institutional, I'd reiterate what I said last quarter. We expect to continue experiencing more near-term variability in our institutional fixed income flows. We are the sixth largest manager of DB assets globally and many of these DB plans remain overfunded and we're seeing these clients derisk. That is leading to more money in motion creating this near-term variation. But as the rate curve normalizes, money will flow back more consistently into institutional fixed income, and we obviously expect to benefit from that given our world-class business. Stepping back from that dynamic, we believe in analyzing our flows over a longer timeframe and looking inclusively at affiliated flows. Affiliated flows stem from when we win pension risk transfer transactions as well as from flow from asset-intensive annuities and life insurance. In the pension space, often the activity within third-party and affiliated are linked. So you're really talking about the same universe of DB plans. So the bottom line is you have to look at both, third-party and affiliated to get the full picture on our PGIM assets under management. If you look across 2024 year-to-date, our third-party institutional flows are a positive $14 billion and our affiliated institutional flows are a positive $15 billion. So we like that track record of success. Just a minute on retail. On the retail side of the business, we continue to achieve improving results. And in the quarter, we saw positive $1.3 billion in inflows. We are seeing in retail, the investors return to fixed income strategies and we would expect that will accelerate given the anticipated Fed direction. So really if you step-back, the strength of our fixed-income franchise is very, very strong. And we think over time, we're going to experience significant tailwinds and will be a net winner over the long-term. Nick Annitto : Thanks. That's helpful. And then maybe just more of a higher-level one. You know, I guess following the GUL deal that you guys just did and some of the other deals that you guys have done, is there any block in the business that you guys kind of view non-core that can be shopped? Charlie Lowrey : Hi, Nick, it's Charlie. Let me take that one and I'll take a step back and then directly answer your question. But, you know, we feel really good about the considerable progress we've made in shifting our business mix to be more capital efficient and the fact that we're well-positioned to capture market opportunities for higher growth. We'd execute it on several transactions that have driven a 50% reduction in our traditional variable annuities portfolio and also a 60% reduction in the guaranteed universal life reserves and then following the transaction we announced in the third quarter with Wilton Re. And while we've been quite successful in increasing our capital efficiency as part of our strategy, we've been equally focused on investing in our market-leading businesses to drive growth with some of those proceeds. Having said that, and this gets to your question, we will consider additional opportunities as long as they meet our strategic and financial objectives and make sense for all our stakeholders. So we'll continue to review our portfolios, but it needs to meet the strategic and financial objectives that we talked about. Nick Annitto : That's helpful. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The question today is coming from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler. Your line is now live. John Barnidge : Good morning. Thank you for the opportunity. On the variable investment income pre-announcement that you're going to do for disclosure going forward. Will that be a wholly separate pre-announcement from the AUM one that comes out as an 8-K? Thanks. Yanela Frias : Hi, John, it's Yanela. That will be included in the current disclosure that we provide on AUM. So it will be all-inclusive. John Barnidge : Thank you for that. And then it sounds like you were upbeat about the growth opportunity at Workplace Solutions. Can you maybe talk about partnerships there that you're working on? Thank you. Caroline Feeney : Yes. Hi, John, it's Caroline. Thank you for your question. And yes, we are very much upbeat and confident in terms of our Group results going-forward. And we have a number of strategic partnerships that we've recently executed. And most of these are very much focused on elevating the customer enrollment experience, but they're also going to be a key contributor to our overall focus on things like claims management. And I'll just give you a few examples, John. One of those is a partnership with a leading edge technology firm that's really transforming the benefits experience for millions of people. And essentially their innovative platform walks employees through the enrollment process, connecting them with credential counselors for one-on-one support. Another partnership we have is with Evolution IQ. This is an AI-driven platform that leverages data to expedite claim, examiner -- evaluations in short as well as long-term disability claims. And the platform is going to help us eliminate manual work. It's going to help us provide better outcomes for customers overall for disability claims. And I would just say in terms of how we're feeling about our group business overall, John, it is growing nicely as we've demonstrated another strong quarter driven by solid underlying fundamentals. We're growing at attractive markets margins. And when I think about our overall diversification strategy, improving claims management capabilities and investments in those strategic partnerships I just mentioned, we're very much positioned to continue to see that profitable growth and solid earnings. John Barnidge : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Wes Carmichael from Autonomous. Your line is now live. Wes Carmichael : Hi, thanks, good morning. My first question, I guess, was on the comments regarding away from the quarterly EPS baseline and moving towards new financial targets. Is there any more color you can provide us on what you're considering for those and realize it's still maybe in flux? Yanela Frias : Hi, Wes. This is Yanela. And so yes, let me start with just kind of reaffirming what we're doing. So we plan to introduce new intermediate-term financial targets beginning for 2025. And really we're making this change to provide greater insight into our financial outlook and to better align with the longer-term nature of our business where the economics emerge over a longer period of time. We also think it will help investors better understand our business outlook and earnings power. So that is really what we're doing. We will be replacing the quarterly baseline. And again, as we shared also, we will be pre-announcing VII. We plan to implement these changes beginning with the release of the fourth quarter earnings results. So we will share the targets and the information at that time. Wes Carmichael : Okay, got it. Thanks, Yanela. My second question, I guess, was on -- sorry, was there something else? Yanela Frias : No, sorry. Wes Carmichael : My second question is on the group business. I saw a press release, I think last quarter that entering the stop-loss business. I guess just curious how meaningful that could be over time and kind of what that business brings through? Caroline Feeney : Yes, of course, Wes, it's Caroline, and I'll take your question. So our entry into the medical stop loss builds upon our strategy to diversify our portfolio across both client segments and products. And this move allows us to better serve the evolving needs of our clients by offering a broader range of solutions, particularly West in the mid-market. And as you know, employers frequently purchase medical stop loss in conjunction with other group products, making it attractive from a portfolio perspective and allowing us to leverage our deep customer and our broker relationships. In the near-term, Wes, we plan to take a thoughtful approach to scaling with a disciplined underwriting process and robust reinsurance program with experienced partners. And given the size of our total book, we expect it to be a small portion of our business mix. Our longer-term success will be guided by a disciplined approach to scale. We're committed to sustainable growth and ensuring that our expansion in this area is both strategic and measured. Wes Carmichael : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Wilma Burdis from Raymond James. Your line is now live. Wilma Burdis : Hi, good morning. Could you talk a little bit more about the Prismic team -- the Prismic Japan team that you're building out? And maybe give us some examples of the types of deals that could make sense and the size of the market? Thanks. RobFalzon: Wilma, it's Rob. Sure. The -- so in order for us to be able to effectively do reinsurance transactions in Japan, we need to have an agency license business on the ground there dedicated to Prismic. And so that's what we've put into place in response to what we see is a very large opportunity there. If you think about the discussions we've had even on this call about the foreign -- the U.S. dollar and other foreign currency-denominated products that are sold-in Japan and have historically been sold-in Japan. With the upcoming ESR, so the new economic solvency regime that's going to be adopted in Japan, there is a there is a it -- that solvency regime is fairly punitive with respect to long duration liabilities and foreign currency denominated liabilities in very much what we believe to be a non-economic way. And we think that that's going to give rise to be a catalyst to ongoing desire by insurers in that marketplace to continue to meet the customer demand for those products, because Japanese customers continue to have an interest in dollar-denominated products and the returns that they can get on those. But to meet -- to be able to square that off with being able to economically finance the reserves and capital against that business in a way that continues to create a compelling economic proposition for the Japanese customers. So we're actually quite excited about that opportunity. We think the brand and quality and scale of our own business -- business there gives us incredible credibility with the other insurers in that marketplace that would be interested in doing things on as I described before that would follow a pattern of what we're able to do with our own book from an optimization standpoint? Wilma Burdis : Okay, thank you. And then my understanding is that there are some tailwinds for U.K. longevity blocks. Is that something you're seeing? And maybe just talk a little bit about why that market is attractive? Thanks. Caroline Feeney : Yes, of course, Wilma, it's Caroline, and I'll take your question. So in the near-term for longevity reinsurance or overall international reinsurance, we remain focused on the U.S., the U.K. and the Netherlands. And that -- but what I would say specifically to your question on the U.K., we continue to see very strong funding levels there, actually reaching 113%. And when we look at the market size in the U.K., we do expect a size of around $70 billion in pension risk transfer for the year, most of which will seek reinsurance solutions. And so this is why we are pleased that we're not only a leader in this business in the U.S., but also in U.K. and obviously, Wilma, you also saw our expansion last year in the Netherlands. And so for the time being, those are very much our three areas of focus and we're pleased to remain a leader. Wilma Burdis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Alex Scott from Barclays. Your line is now live. Alex Scott : Hi, good morning. First one I had for you is on the comments that were made on, I guess, surrenders in foreign currency products being a bit elevated. And it was noted that there was some earnings pressure from that. I wanted to also get a feel for what kind of revenue pressure is that exhibiting on the international franchise, particularly Life Planner? Andy Sullivan : So Alex, it's Andy. I'll take -- I'll take your question. And maybe just let's start by explaining the dynamics to make sure everyone has it clear. So the weaker yen is leading to an enhanced level of U.S. dollar policy surrenders. That's really kind of flowing from two things. First, on U.S. dollar recurring premium products, affordability has become an issue for customers as it takes more yen to pay the premium. Second, some customers in our U.S. dollar investment products are looking to monetize their gains. So with this, they either reduce their level of coverage or they turn the policy in. That obviously has some influence on our sales, but I think the best way to think about this is had it not been for this surrender experience over this recent -- recent period, we would have seen instead of being flat, low-single-digit earnings growth across our PII business segment. So it's influencing both obviously the premium and the AOI. Alex Scott : Got it. That's helpful. And then I had a follow-up on the potential for reinsurance in Japan and the comments on Prismic. When I think about Pru's business, it very much aligns with what was described in terms of longer duration, a lot of foreign currency denominated in USD, etc. If you were to engage in a transaction involving your own business, should we think about that more as like mitigating whatever impact would have been there from the economic solvency regime or is -- or does it go further than that? I mean, should we think about it as potentially releasing capital that could -- that could be redeployed elsewhere in your business. So let me answer that question. RobFalzon: Sorry, it's Rob. Let me answer that question. Well, let me say more broadly, when we think about reinsurance. And whether that'd be to Prismic or it'd be to sort of other opportunities that we have for reinsurance within our portfolio, we really think about reinsurance as an opportunity to, one, derisk and grow our portfolio. So financing for growth and by reinsuring, diversifying against risk. And we also think about that as the -- as an opportunity for optimizing our backbook and that will be in response to things like you're alluding to the TSR regime, the economic solvency regime and excuse me in Japan. And when we look at the benefits from that reinsurance, we then say, okay, from an economic and business strategy standpoint, what is the optimal outcome for us? So as we're thinking about that, there are going to be instances where we're looking to do reinsurance in order to be able to deliver products to the marketplace on a compelling -- with a compelling value proposition. There are going to be other times when we're looking to ensure that we've got an optimization of our own capital against the regimes as they're being modified. And there are other times when we just see a dislocation between how blocks of business are being valued within our franchise in a public basis versus what we see as the opportunity to transact in the private marketplace where they will be valued differently, obviously at a higher valuation on -- and provide therefore to our investors, shareholders a better risk-adjusted return by being to monetize those. Yanela Frias : And Alex, maybe if I could add specifically to Japan and our business and ESR, I did share in the first quarter that we reinsured $3 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated whole life products from Japan to our Bermuda affiliate Gibraltari. And in the second quarter, we executed a transaction for U.S. dollar new business from Gibraltar to PICA. So definitely is a tool that will help us stabilize capital in all of our operating entities, including in Japan. Yes. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is a follow-up from Wes Carmichael from Autonomous. Your line is now live. Wes Carmichael : Hi, thanks for taking the follow-up. I guess I just really wanted to follow-up on this particular topic on ESR. And Rob, your comments that you know this regime is punitive and perhaps uneconomic for long-duration liabilities. Like I guess I think about -- I understand that you have levers for reinsurance for your own book, but is this transition to ESR, like is this ex reinsurance, like would this be somewhat problematic in terms of you know, Pru needing to capitalize the business to a greater degree or something? I'm just trying to understand kind of the issue that maybe you and both Japanese insurers are facing here. Andy Sullivan : Yes. No, Wes, it's Andy. You want to start Yanela, and then I'll add in? Yanela Frias : Yes, Wes, let me start in terms of the impact to our capital position. So I'll reiterate that we believe our Japan businesses are well-capitalized and financially strong and that strength would be reflected under any reasonable capital standard, including the new ESR framework like as we mentioned that we have tools like reinsurance. We have transacted in a couple of blocks of business, but we expect that upon implementation of our capital levels will continue to be above target levels that would support a AA financial strength ratings in Japan. Andy Sullivan : Yes, Wes, and it's Andy. I was just going to add. We've managed changing capital regimes at Prudential over a very long period of time. In Japan, we have a very broad product portfolio that meets the needs of our customers. We've continued to innovate and expand that portfolio, including with ESR-friendly type products. So the bottom-line is as a management team, between the product capabilities combined with our strong underwriting, our ALM capabilities, hedging and reinsurance, we believe we have everything -- we need to continue to profitably grow in Japan and navigate these changes. Wes Carmichael : Got it. That's all very helpful. And I guess my follow-up would be, just any help with the outlook for the pension risk transfer market into the fourth quarter. I know the third quarter was a big one with IBM. But as you look to this quarter and maybe even to 2025, any thoughts there? Caroline Feeney : Yes. Of course, Wes, it's Caroline, and I'll take that one. So with over $16 billion and a 40% market share in PRT sales this year, clearly we're continuing to demonstrate our strong market leadership. And as we look forward to '25, we continue to view the U.S. PRT market as highly attractive with $3 trillion in outstanding U.S. corporate pension liabilities, favorable funding positions and a robust long-term pipeline of opportunities. And while the market remains highly competitive, we believe we are uniquely positioned to execute. Of course, our scale, our depth of underwriting experience as well as our ability to originate attractive assets enable us to price competitively while generating attractive returns for our shareholders. We also delivered deep expertise, have a demonstrated ability to handle complex deals and provide industry-leading service. And Wes, we believe that combination is evident in our sales this year where over half of our transactions have been with existing clients. And those traits are exactly why Prudential remains one of the few companies to have successfully executed transactions over $1 billion and why we continue to feel very confident about our go-forward business. Wes Carmichael : Great. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is a follow-up from Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. Tom Gallagher : Thanks, Yanela, just -- would you mind reiterating what you said you're going to change the quarterly disclosure? Did you say you were going to eliminate the quarterly bridge that you typically provide on the next quarter-out? And I think I heard you say you were going to start pre-announcing alternatives and any other changes you're planning on making? Thanks. Yanela Frias : Yes, Tom. So we are eliminating the quarterly baseline disclosure and we're replacing that with intermediate-term financial targets, starting with '25 and pre-announcing variable investment income. Those are the two key changes we're making. We are still going to speak to unique items in the quarter really to help you understand what's happening, but that's the extent of the changes. Tom Gallagher : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is a follow-up from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Suneet Kamath : Hi, thanks. I just wanted to circle back on this concept of doing a backbook deal with Prismic. I just want to make sure I'm thinking about it right. So if you were to do a deal with a block of business from Japan, is it fair to say that there might be some initial EPS pressure because you're giving up some of the earnings that you're now -- you own 100% of it and obviously, you'll give up some of those earnings to your Prismic partners. Presumably, you'll free up some capital, which you can then deploy in new business, but there might be a little bit of a lag between when you lose the earnings on the backbook versus when you deploy the capital that's being freed. Is that the right way to think about it or is there some sort of offset that I'm missing there? RobFalzon: No, Suneet, I think you've -- I'm sorry, it's Rob. I think you've captured it well, which is -- that's not unique to doing a backbook deal in Japan. That's that you could use that same description and apply it to each of the reinsurance transactions that we've done to date, which is that by virtue of reinsuring we unlock capital and embedded value and in Japan, in particular, we think that our products there have very high levels of margins in the reserves that we have and so we're able to release those reserves and capital associated with it. By virtue of reinsuring, then the AOI associated with that block will no longer appear on our earnings. However, our analysis looks at what the economics of that translate into with the freed up capital and our ability to redeploy that capital. And does PGIM manage all of the assets that back the Japanese liabilities already or is there a portion of assets that they don't manage that if it went into Prismic, it would start to earn fees on? RobFalzon: No. The assets that we have within our business today are the vast, vast majority of them are managed by PGIM. There's a selective a couple of instances where we do have some third-party managers in specific areas that PGIM is not focused on. But I would say by and large, it'd be accurate to characterize that those liabilities -- excuse me, those assets that are backing the liabilities are being managed by PGIM today. When they transferred into Prismic, they would be managed -- continue to be managed by PGIM, but on a sort of a third-party set of economics as opposed to the economic arrangement we have with the general account and that generally is accretive to PGIM. Suneet Kamath : Got it. Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lowrey for any further closing comments. Charlie Lowrey : Okay. Thank you, and thank you again for joining us today. We've entered the last quarter of this year, pleased with the progress we've made to become a higher-growth and more capital-efficient company. We are well-positioned to address the growing needs of our customers and clients around the world as they seek to protect their life's work and live better lives longer. So thank you again and enjoy the rest of the day. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Prudential's quarterly earnings conference call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. Press star zero, and an operator will assist you offline. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now turn the call over to Mr. Bob McLaughlin. Please go ahead. Bob McLaughlin : Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Representing Prudential Financial, Inc. on today's call are Charlie Lowrey, chairman and CEO, Rob Falzon, vice chairman, Andy Sullivan, head of international businesses and PGIM, our global investment manager, Caroline Feeney, head of US businesses, Yanela Frias, chief financial officer, and Robert Axel, controller and principal accounting officer. We will start with prepared comments by Charlie, Rob, and Yanela and then we will take your questions. Today's discussion may include forward-looking statements. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from the predictions we make today. In addition, our presentation includes references to non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of such measures to the comparable GAAP measures, and a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, please see the slides titled Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures in the appendix to today's presentation and the quarterly financial supplement, both of which can be found on our website at investors.prudential.com. And now, I'll turn it over to Charlie. Charlie Lowrey : Thank you, Bob, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. First, I'd like to comment on the leadership changes we announced in the fourth quarter. The board appointed Andy Sullivan as Prudential's next CEO effective March 31st. He is an exceptional leader, and the board and I have every confidence he is the right person to take Prudential into the future. Also at the end of March, Caroline Feeney will take on an expanded role overseeing our global retirement and insurance businesses. Both Andy and Caroline have been highly engaged in setting and executing our strategy, so we expect a smooth transition. And Jacques Chapuis will be joining as CEO of PGIM, our global asset management business. Both Caroline and Jacques will report directly to Andy. This is an exciting and significant time for Prudential. And the right time to elevate the next generation of leadership as we mark our 150th anniversary. Finally, I'd also note that just last week, we were recognized as the number one company among our life and health insurance peers for 2024 on Fortune's List of the World's Most Admired Companies. Now let's turn to our results. In 2024, we made significant progress on our path to becoming a higher growth, more capital-efficient company. We maintained our disciplined approach to capital deployment while also continuing to invest in our businesses and returned excess capital to shareholders. Our strategic progress and performance are backed by our financial strength. Turning to slide three, our results for the full year reflect continued momentum as we further diversified our product suite and expanded our distribution capabilities to address the investment, insurance, and retirement needs of our customers and clients around the world. Earnings for the fourth quarter were lower than we anticipated but do not reflect the earnings power of our businesses. This was largely due to adverse underwriting experience primarily driven by an elevated level of large individual life claims. Large claim activity will vary on a quarterly basis, but our fundamentals remain strong. And the actions we are taking across our businesses create a solid foundation for future growth. We reported strong full-year sales across our retirement and insurance businesses as well as strong investment performance and significant positive net flows. PGIM reported robust affiliated and third-party flows for the full year 2024, benefiting from our broad capabilities across fixed income, equities, and our diversified private alternatives platform, and fueled by the growing global retirement opportunity and the growth of our retirement and insurance businesses. Our retirement strategies business continues to address the growing needs of the market as a leader in pension risk transfer and individual annuities. On the institutional side, our pension risk transfer business had the highest annual level of sales for any single carrier since 2012. On the individual side, we had our ninth consecutive quarter of sales growth. We also continue to diversify our product and expand our distribution networks in group insurance and individual life, which resulted in continued sales momentum. And in our international businesses, we continue to diversify our product portfolio in Japan, including retirement solutions, and we expanded our distribution channels in Brazil. In addition to the momentum we are seeing across our businesses, during 2024, we successfully executed on a number of transactions that enhanced our capital flexibility, improved the quality of our earnings, and shifted our business mix. We completed two guaranteed universal life reinsurance transactions, which reduced our cumulative exposure to this product by 60%. And just last month, we announced our second Prismic transaction to insure a $7 billion block of Japanese whole life policies, adding further scale to the Prismic platform. Turning to slide four, our continued investments in our businesses are supported by our disciplined approach to capital deployment, which included returning nearly $3 billion to shareholders in 2024. In addition, the board has authorized share repurchases of up to $1 billion in 2025 and increased the common stock dividend for the 17th consecutive year. Turning to slide five, our strategic progress is supported by our robust risk and capital framework. We maintained a AA rating, which reflects a healthy capital position including holding more than $4 billion in highly liquid assets. We also maintained a well-diversified high-quality investment portfolio and a disciplined approach to asset liability management. We are operating from a position of strength and have entered 2025 with continued confidence in our strategy, our capabilities, and our path to deliver long-term sustainable value for all our stakeholders. Before I turn the call over to Rob, I want to acknowledge the extraordinary partnership we have shared over these past six years. Rob is retiring from Prudential in July, culminating a remarkable 42-year career with the firm, in which he has made innumerable and material contributions to our continued success and future growth. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob. Rob Falzon : Thank you, Charlie. It's been a privilege. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, U.S., and International businesses. I'll begin on slide six with our financial results. Our pretax adjusted operating income was $1.4 billion or $2.96 per share for the fourth quarter of 2024, and $5.9 billion or $12.62 per share for the full year, up 6% from 2023. This reflects the execution of our strategy to grow our market-leading businesses and was driven by higher fee and spread income due to continued strong sales and flows as well as the benefit of higher interest rates in equity markets, net of increased expenses to support the growth of our businesses. Our GAAP net loss for the quarter was $57 million. This was primarily due to interest rate-driven realized losses on the investment portfolio that will be transferred to Prismic in connection with our recently announced reinsurance transaction, as well as some modest repositioning of our investment portfolio in the quarter. 2024 adjusted operating return on equity of 13.1% improved 70 basis points from 2023. This reflects the strength of our businesses and the benefits from the deliberate actions we have taken to pivot to more capital-efficient and higher growth products. Turning to the quarterly operating results from our businesses compared to the year-ago quarter, PGIM, our Global Investment Manager, had higher asset management fees driven by strong net flows, market appreciation, favorable investment performance, and increasing contributions from the DeerPath Capital acquisition and higher other related revenues driven by higher incentive fees. This was partially offset by higher expenses to support business growth. Results of our U.S. businesses reflected higher expenses related to the one-time transaction impacts associated with the closing of both universal life reinsurance transactions and the consolidation of our captive financing arrangements, less favorable underwriting results driven by mortality experience and true-ups, and lower net fee income. Spread income primarily driven by business growth. Our international businesses had less favorable underwriting results, primarily reflected elevated U.S. dollar product surrenders with the continued weakness in the yen and higher expenses to support business growth. These were partially offset by increased spread income due to higher yields from favorable market performance reinvestment of the portfolio. Turning to slide seven, PGIM, our global investment manager, has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, equities, and alternatives. PGIM's investment performance remained strong with 78% and 85% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last five and ten-year periods respectively. PGIM's assets under management increased by 6% to $1.4 trillion from year-end 2023, driven by market appreciation, net flows, and strong investment performance. Total net flows in the quarter of $8.6 billion included affiliated net flows of $8.9 billion driven by a large annuities mandate partially offset by $300 million of third-party net outflows. Total net flows for the full year 2024 were $38 billion including $24 billion in affiliated flows and $14 billion from third-party clients. These inflows reflect the competitive positioning of both PGIM and our retirement business in the wake of large, albeit episodic, institutional pension plan activity. As the investment engine of Prudential, PGIM's capabilities support the success and growth of our U.S. and international businesses in retirement, asset management, and insurance. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise, and access to institutional and other sources of private capital, including through our sponsored reinsurer Prismic, are a competitive advantage, helping our businesses bring enhanced solutions and create more value for our customers. Our retirement and insurance businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated net flows as well as unique access to insurance liabilities. In addition, our diversified PGIM private alternatives platform, which has assets under management of nearly $250 billion, experienced 37% growth in private credit origination activity in 2024 compared to the prior year. This was driven by our direct lending businesses, including our acquisition of DeerPath Capital and the organic build-out of our private asset-backed financing business. Turning to slide eight, our U.S. businesses produced diversified sources of earnings from fees, net investment spread, and underwriting income, and benefit from a complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to focus on growing our market-leading businesses by expanding our addressable market with new financial solutions delivered to a broader distribution footprint, leveraging capabilities across Prudential, and enhancing those capabilities to improve the experience of our customers and distribution partners while driving operating efficiencies. Retirement strategies generated strong sales at $50 billion in 2024 across its institutional and individual lines of business. Contributed to $36 billion of sales for the year, up 27% from the prior year. U.S. funded pension risk transfer transactions for the year were over $16 billion, the highest annual level for any single carrier since we set the record in 2012. Additionally, longevity risk transfer sales totaled over $10 billion this year. Individual Retirement posted $3.6 billion in sales in the fourth quarter, its best quarter of sales in over a decade. 2024 sales were over $14 billion, up 84% from the prior year. Our product pivots and innovation have resulted in continued strong sales of our registered indexed linked annuities and fixed annuity product sales have doubled from the prior year. Additionally, we continue to reduce market sensitivity by running off our legacy variable annuities. Group insurance sales totaled $550 million in 2024, up 4% from the prior year, driven by growth in supplemental health. We are executing our strategy of both product and client segmentation diversification, while leveraging technology to increase operating efficiency and enhance the customer experience. These actions to improve profitability and performance resulted in a benefits ratio of which is at the low end of our target range. In individual life, sales reached a quarterly record high of $326 million in the fourth quarter and for the full year increased to 23% from 2023. These increases include the benefit from the strength and breadth of our distribution capabilities, the expansion of our product offerings, including our pivot towards more capital-efficient products, and from an increased level of estate planning sales concentrated in the fourth quarter. Turning to slide nine, our international businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model, as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in targeted high-growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high-quality service and expanding our distribution of product offerings. Our needs-based selling approach and protection and retirement product focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a selective portfolio of businesses in regions where customer needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market-leading businesses, and where the Prudential enterprise can add value. Sales in our international businesses for 2024 were up 6% compared to the prior year. Sales in Japan are benefiting from recent retirement and savings product launches, which are gaining traction with customers, resulting in a 14% increase in sales of these products compared to the full year 2023. In addition, emerging market sales increased 12% versus the prior year, driven by growth in Brazil. We continue to expand third-party distribution and benefit from the strong performance of our Life planners. As we look ahead, we are well-positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance, and retirement security. We continue to focus on investing in growth businesses and markets, delivering industry-leading customer and client experiences, and creating the next generation of financial solutions to serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. And with that, I'll now hand it over to Yanela. Yanela Frias : Thank you, Rob. I will begin on slide ten. Our significant capital position and strong regulatory capital ratios can and our ability to expand our market-leading businesses. Our cash and liquid assets were $4.6 billion, which is above our minimum liquidity target of $3 billion, and we have substantial off-balance sheet resources. Now turning to slide eleven. As I mentioned on last quarter's call, in order to provide greater insights into our financial outlook and align with our longer-term nature of our business, we are introducing new financial targets through 2027. Our significant growth in sales and flows supported by the strength of our balance sheet and our commitment to become a higher growth, more capital-efficient company position us well to achieve these targets. We expect this will lead to annual core earnings per share growth of 5% to 8%, which is based off of core adjusted operating income per share for 2024. And an adjusted return on equity of 13% to 15%. We're also introducing an operating expense ratio for our global retirement and insurance businesses an anticipated range of 8.5% to 10.5%, which we expect will trend down over the three-year period. The momentum in our sales and flows combined with operating efficiencies and incremental buybacks are expected to contribute to our earnings growth and returns over the three-year period. But this performance may not be linear due to the near-term strain from new business and the impact of runoff blocks. In addition, we will remain thoughtful in our capital deployment, preserving our financial strength and flexibility by targeting to maintain highly liquid assets of over $3 billion at the holding company while investing in our businesses for long-term sustainable, profitable growth. We expect to deploy 30% to 40% of capital generated towards organic growth as we see significant opportunities in our chosen markets. After consideration of organic growth, this yields a free cash flow ratio of approximately 65% of net income, with 35% to 45% expected to be deployed to attractive and increasing dividends. This is a healthy return to shareholders that represent an annual payout of approximately 6% of adjusted book value as of year-end 2024. Further, we expect to return 20% to 30% towards share repurchase and the board authorized $1 billion of repurchases in 2025. Finally, we continue to proactively explore opportunities to invest in inorganic growth while maintaining a disciplined approach to capital deployment in the current environment. Turning to slide twelve. Our enterprise metrics will be supported by our business segment growth targets. We expect low double-digit earnings growth in PGIM, backed by strong asset management fee growth of 6% to 9%, driven by net flows and market appreciation and an adjusted operating margin of 25% to 30%. In the U.S. businesses, we expect mid-single-digit earnings growth, supported by account value and sales growth across businesses. In retirement strategies, our account value growth assumes annual growth sales of $35 billion to $45 billion will be partially offset by annual net runoff of our pension and longevity risk transfer products of $8 billion to $10 billion and legacy variable annuities of $12 billion to $16 billion. In group insurance, we expect premium growth of 2% to 4% and in individual life, we expect sales to be flat to 5% growth. And lastly, in our international businesses, we expect low to mid-single-digit earnings growth driven by sales growth of 4% to 6% as we continue to diversify our product mix. We also have included our key economic assumptions and other earnings considerations specific to 2025 in the appendix. We are confident in our ability to deliver on these financial objectives as we drive incremental organic growth in our businesses while continuing to maintain our disciplined capital deployment approach. So turning to slide thirteen and in summary, continue to become a higher growth, more capital-efficient company. We will maintain our disciplined approach to capital deployment and our growth is supported by the strength of our balance sheet. And with that, we will be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question and answer session. Our first question today is coming from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Suneet Kamath : Great. Thanks. I want to start on the annuity outlook. I see the 20% to 25% account value growth. Caroline, I was just wondering if you could help us maybe translate that into sales growth expectations for the year. And the reason I ask is, yeah, I think LIMRA is out saying sales will probably be down for the industry. And I just want to get a sense of how you're thinking about Prudential's outlook. Caroline Feeney : Yeah. Terrific, Suneet. We'll certainly take your question. So clearly, it was another extremely strong year for annuities, with over $425 billion in total industry sales last year. And I think what LIMRA might be referencing in terms of some of their outlook is this past quarter the industry did see some softening of traditional fixed annuity sales, which is to be expected with rate decreases. So what we're seeing is a shift from MYGAs, which are more sensitive to rates, to index products such as RILAs. But Suneet, what I would point out is that RILA sales were up over 35% across the industry last year. So in our own business, we continue to see positive results. In the fourth quarter, we delivered roughly $3.5 billion in sales, which was our ninth consecutive quarter of sales growth. So from an outlook perspective, Suneet, as we've discussed previously, we continue to see those compelling tailwinds in the marketplace driven by aging demographics, plus a high volume of money in motion, and that includes an estimated $70 billion in fixed annuities that's coming due, as well as over $7 trillion of money market fund balances. So all of this just underscores the importance of our diversified product portfolio. As you know, Suneet, this has been a key focus for us over the past few years. And as a result, we now have the broadest individual product portfolio in our history. And we actually have five different products with over a billion in annual sales. So overall, we believe the tailwinds will continue to support strong sales. And certainly, we are well-positioned to capture demand thanks to the strength of our distribution and our well-established brand. Suneet Kamath : Got it. And then I just wanted to pivot to Prismic. Obviously, we saw the internal reinsurance deal. You know, presumably, that's going to consume some of their time and capital. I guess the question is, how quickly do you think Prismic could sort of pivot to maybe some third-party deals, particularly in Japan? Is it going to take some time for them to integrate this transaction or any thoughts around that would be helpful. Rob Falzon : Suneet, it's Rob. I'll address that. So yeah, we closed the second transaction as we, I think, had indicated, Japan-based. A number of important reasons for doing that. But more broadly, as we think about the Japan opportunity, including the third-party opportunity in Japan, we think it's a significant growth opportunity for Prismic, both from our own book and third-party reinsurance. Japan's the third-largest life market in the world, and it's been relatively underserved by third-party reinsurers. So there's an opportunity there, and that opportunity is sort of accelerating by virtue of the introduction of the ESR regime. And its impact on legacy books that have been sold not just by us, but across the industry. ESR has a non-economic treatment of long-duration foreign currency-denominated products. That's in the Japan marketplace, but the industry has sold a lot of that. And continues to sell it because of the demand that our customers have for the product. And so addressing those books and those flows of sales are going to be something that the industry has to grapple with and we think we're well-positioned to do so. Our brand, our local presence, and the market intelligence that we've got create a competitive advantage. Prismic, as we've indicated in the last quarter, we've stood up a dedicated licensed team in Japan. And then by virtue of, as I indicated upfront, by closing on our own whole life book, it's given us the experience and confidence to execute third-party blocks and further establishes our credibility in the marketplace. But I would emphasize more generally, we're optimistic that we can grow Prismic through the multiple levers that we've got, Suneet. So that includes ongoing balance sheet optimization both in the U.S. and Japan. It includes importantly flow, so new sales solutions across our businesses. And third-party blocks, particularly in Japan. Suneet Kamath : Got it. Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. Tom Gallagher : Good morning. A few questions on free cash flow. So the 65% free cash flow conversion, why is 30% to 40% of that needed for growth capital when most of the businesses that I would think of requiring capital are growing sub 5%? Yanela Frias : Hey, Tom. It's Yanela. So, let me take that. So we continue to see strong opportunities in our chosen markets and we're leaning into those opportunities as evidenced by our strong sales and flows really across our businesses. So as an example, on a full-year basis, we had a 39% increase in sales for retirement strategies, a 23% increase in sales for individual life, and these strong sales are contributing to earnings. But we do face near-term headwinds due to a strain from new business, specifically distribution costs that are not deferred. And the impact of runoff. So, you know, I would emphasize that we're investing in strong growth that is materializing in earnings, but we have near-term headwinds related to new business strain and runoff. And as these headwinds moderate, we would expect an upward trajectory in our core earnings growth. But even with these headwinds, we have a 5% to 8% growth rate in core earnings. We are paying a healthy dividend, and we have a healthy level of buybacks. Tom Gallagher : Gotcha. And, Yanela, just a follow-up making sure I'm understanding what the intention is here. When I'm solving for buybacks and dividends. If I take the 75% of the 65% free cash flow conversion, that would equate to about 50% of GAAP earnings that will be returned through buybacks and dividends over the next three years. Is that the rough math? And just a related question, I think you used to use operating income. Now you're using net income. Is there anything to read into with the change in that conversion? Thanks. Yanela Frias : Yeah. So, I mean, if you look at our capital allocation priorities that we shared, it's so attractive in dividends are 35% to 45%, share repurchases 20% to 30%. So I think you're just adding those two when you get to the 75%. And so in terms of the change to net income, you know, while AOI is our primary basis for assessing operating results, we do think that over the near term, GAAP net income will be a closer proxy for free cash flows. And that is because there are items that are excluded from AOI that do impact statutory capital, which is the primary driver of cash flows. So for example, realized gains and losses that arise due to normal course portfolio management activity or mark to market on hedging instruments impact both GAAP and stat. Now, conversely, there are some components of GAAP net income that don't impact cash flows. But our free cash flow ratio is an overtime calculation, Tom. And we do anticipate that much of the non-economic volatility largely evens out over time, leaving us with net income being a good indicator of cash flows in the near term for us. Tom Gallagher : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Your line is now live. Ryan Krueger : Hey, thanks. Good morning. My first question was just on the ULSG transaction you completed in the Japan Prismic that announced between the two of them you're freeing up several hundred million dollars. I think over $500 million but kept the buyback at $1 billion for 2025. Can you give more color on how you may use that capital over time? Are you holding it for potential opportunistic M&A, or are there any other considerations where you could use that for? Yanela Frias : Hi, Ryan. It's Yanela. So, you know, the potential uses of the capital will be consistent with our capital allocation priorities that we detailed with our financial targets, and we'll be consistent with our essentially, our priority is in terms of how we think about capital deployment. So we look to strike a balance between preserving financial strength and flexibility, investing in our businesses for long-term growth, and returning capital to shareholders. As part of our shareholder distribution philosophy, a core level of share repurchases will generally be sustainable. But keep in mind that that may vary with opportunities for attractive capital deployment or reductions in free cash flow in times of stress. So we constantly monitor developments in economic and market conditions. We will follow our risk management and capital management playbooks with discipline to be prepared for opportunities and risks as well. Ryan Krueger : Thank you. And then there was a recent lawsuit against the plan sponsor that involved the pension risk transfer transaction with Prudential. There have been some other lawsuits against other plan sponsors from other risk transfer providers that have had some negative impact, it seems, on activity. Do you think this will have any impact on Prudential's transaction pipeline, or do you view this more as a one-off issue? Caroline Feeney : Yeah. So, Ryan, it's Caroline, and I'll take your question. And while I won't comment on the impact on any other peer companies, I will say clearly that litigation like this threatens the ongoing health of the pension risk transfer industry. It's particularly harmful for plan sponsors who are looking to de-risk their pension obligations and for the retiree whose pensions are protected through these transactions. So, fundamentally, companies like Prudential who are governed by the insurance regulatory system are simply better holders of these types of risks. Our industry has an extensive history of fulfilling the promises made to retirees since we here at Prudential actually pioneered this business in a transaction with the Cleveland Public Library, which was now over a hundred years ago, Ryan. So while we're not a named party in the lawsuit, let me just reiterate that this lawsuit does not accurately represent Prudential or the quality and security of the industry. In terms of the impact going forward from a new business perspective, Ryan, we still see strong funded statuses and we see favorable market conditions. So we have every reason to believe there will continue to be an active pipeline. And with our ability to work with plan sponsors of all different sizes, we remain confident. Ryan Krueger : Thanks. Appreciate the response. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I know you guys said the 5% to 8% EPS growth outlook, right, is not expected to be linear, I think was the words. And, obviously, there could be some variation by year. But how would you think, you know, going into 2025, your expectations there relative to the 5% to 8% target? Yanela Frias : Yeah. Hi, Elyse. It's Yanela. So I would start by saying that we feel confident about our 5% to 8% EPS growth target off of core earnings. We see strong opportunities and tailwinds and we're executing on those opportunities as evidenced by our strong sales and flows. But as you pointed out and as I said in my opening remarks, this growth will not be linear, and we do have near-term headwinds, mainly due to strain of sales and runoff. So the 5% to 8% is an average over the three-year period. It could be lower or higher in any given year. And, naturally, as the headwinds of some of our runoff blocks moderate, and our growth investments take hold, we would expect an upward trajectory in our core earnings over that three-year period. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks. And then my second question is just on Prismic in Japan. You guys did announce a recent transaction. Beyond that, you know, as we deal with the capital changes in Japan, do you guys expect to do additional transactions with Prismic there? Rob Falzon : Elyse, it's Rob. I'll take that question. We're continuing to work on an active pipeline of multiple reinsurance transactions. They include ongoing balance sheet optimization from our own book, both in the U.S. and Japan. We're working on flow solutions as well across our businesses, again, in the U.S. and Japan. And we are looking at third-party blocks with a focus there being really almost exclusively in Japan. So our expectation is that yes, we'll continue to have opportunities with Prismic to address what we see as a significant market opportunity, not just in our own book, but across the industry in Japan. Elyse Greenspan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Wes Carmichael from Autonomous Research. Your line is now live. Wes Carmichael : Hey, good morning. I wanted to follow-up on Japan and maybe the progress that's being made on the ESR implementation. I think your Japanese SMR ratios are in excess of 700% today. But could you give us any insight on your view of current capital in Japan if you had to implement ESR today? Yanela Frias : Hi, Wes. This is Yanela. So, yeah, the JFSA's plan is to adopt the ESR for the fiscal year beginning April 1st, 2025, with the first mandatory reporting date being March 31st, 2026. We expect upon implementation of ESR that our capital levels will continue to be above target levels that would support AA financial strength ratings. And as we said before, our intent is to start providing information about our ESR position in the summer. We have executed some transactions, affiliated reinsurance transactions to help mitigate the volatility. And like we always do, we constantly seek to optimize our balance sheet and manage our risks in capital and reserving regimes that best match the economics of our product. So we don't anticipate a significant change in our capital position in those entities. Andy Sullivan : Hey, Wes. It's Andy. Let me just add that in Japan, you know, we offer a broad product portfolio, including with ESR-friendly offerings. You know, so the bottom line for us is these product capabilities, when combined with our strong underwriting, our asset liability management, and our hedging, you know, we have everything that we need to continue to profitably grow well in Japan. Wes Carmichael : Got it. Thank you. And maybe Andy, as a follow-up, as you think about taking the reins of Prudential at the end of March, how are you thinking about your direction as a leader of the business? Any color on where you're most focused strategically in your first few months as CEO? Andy Sullivan : Yeah. So, Wes, thank you for the question. And let me start by saying this is an absolute honor and it's a privilege, and I couldn't be more excited about what's ahead of us. You know, as you would expect, we have a rigorous transition plan that we're marching through, and that transition's going very well. It obviously helps that I've been a member of this executive team now for over five years. But having said that, we always have a lot of work to get done in front of us. We absolutely intend to continue to raise the performance of the company over time, given the strong opportunities that we see in the marketplace. So, you know, what I'd say is I'm not yet in the role, so it would be premature to share additional information right now. But I look forward to sharing more with you in future calls as the team settles in. Wes Carmichael : Got it. Thanks, Andy. Operator : Our next question is coming from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler. Your line is now live. John Barnidge : Good morning. Thank you for the opportunity. My question is on the free cash flow conversion and the 0% to 10% opportunistic M&A. I know Prudential maintained its ownership in the second round of Prismic. Is that going to be the main consumer of that 0% to 10% of M&A, or does there remain interest in high-growth emerging markets international in asset management as previously expressed by the company in prior years? Charlie Lowrey : So John, it's Charlie. I will take your question. I say thank you. I'm excited to get a question. So that's great. You know, taking a step back for a moment, again, as always, organic growth is job number one as you heard from some of the other management. But we're open to opportunities and opportunistic and selective M&A that accelerates our strategy and meets our financial objectives as we go forward. In the past, we've executed on many acquisitions that have significantly grown the company. And we pursued these acquisitions for a whole variety of reasons, such as expanding our capabilities, broadening our distribution, increasing scale, or adding key talent. And as we look forward, we're going to focus on organic growth opportunities to expand our product breadth and distribution capabilities, scale our existing businesses, including through Prismic as you suggest, which provides us access to third-party capital, and we will be both strategic and selective in our M&A interest. Which remain consistent in terms of focusing on our programmatic acquisitions for PGIM or emerging markets and focusing on distribution capabilities or scale. John Barnidge : Thank you. That's helpful. And with the pipes kind of laid with that second transaction in Prismic, are you beginning to kind of warehouse liabilities and investors for subsequent rounds so the friction is less? Rob Falzon : John, it's Rob. We don't have a specific plan for warehousing liabilities in the way that you described it. What I would say is that we have brand quality and scale in our insurance and retirement business both in the U.S. and in Japan. And so we both have significant back books and we have a significant volume of sales as EBITDA. And with the sales across our businesses. And so we don't have a bespoke warehouse. Instead, what we have is a business system which is generating significant amounts of liabilities, which lend themselves to opportunities for Prismic on a go-forward basis. John Barnidge : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Jack Madden from BMO. Your line is now live. Jack Madden : Hi. Good morning. Just one follow-up on the free cash flow conversion. You mentioned the headwinds from new business strain and the impact of runoff. I guess just to clarify, are those comments related to GAAP earnings or are you referring to the cash flow conversion ratio because the business strain element of that makes sense to me, but I would have thought that blocks running off would have had a higher cash flow conversion rate since you're not incurring any new business strains. So just want to make sure I'm understanding those impacts correctly. Yanela Frias : Yeah. Jack, it's Yanela. So, yes, I was referring to the GAAP earnings, AOI, core earnings specifically in my answer to the runoff and the new business strain. Jack Madden : Got it. Thank you. And then just a question on the intermediate-term growth outlook within the international operations. In your guidance for low to mid-single-digit earnings growth, I guess, is that outlook assuming that products remain to raise normalize off of the more recent kind of elevated levels? Any other drivers that you would call out as jogging an uptick in kind of your growth trajectory in those markets? Andy Sullivan : Yeah. It's Andy. I'll take the question. So, you know, as we look at the growth at a low to mid-single-digit earnings rate, the growth is really driven by a few things : favorable net spread results that flow from higher yields and stronger alternative investment income, stronger underwriting results as our sales momentum is continuing, and obviously a continued expense discipline. Those positive forces are going to more than counteract the near-term pressure that we're expecting to continue from the U.S. dollar product surrenders in Japan. Those, we did see in Q4 the lowest level of surrenders of any quarter in 2024. So we think and believe over time that'll stabilize. Net-net, we expect solid growth, but we are having to overcome some of these headwinds. Jack Madden : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Alex Scott from Barclays. Your line is now live. Alex Scott : Hi. I wanted to drill into the PGIM drivers of earnings growth in the low double digits that you provided. It looks like, you know, revenue is more, you know, mid-single digits. So I just wanted to understand the margin improvement that you're expecting there. It looks to be pretty substantial. And, you know, I just wanted to understand, like, what are some of the things that are tangible that you're doing to improve the expense base. Andy Sullivan : Thanks, Alex. It's Andy. So let me talk about our PGIM margins. And let me just start by saying we are pleased with the progress that we've made improving the margins every quarter through 2024, ending the year with a 25.6% margin. So really good progress. That being said, because we've talked about previous quarters, overall, our margins are still depressed as a result of the higher rate environment and the impact that has on both fixed income and from the slowdown in the real estate market. But, you know, the path for us is very clear. We expect to expand our margins towards 30% really led by three main drivers. First, an improving fixed income and real estate environment, that will drive fees, and it'll drive a normalization of flows and fundraising. Second, we expect continued traction in our growth investments where we're seeing very real progress, particularly in our private credit work. And third, we do have a continued discipline on expenses. I know that's been a laser focus for us, and we are balancing finding efficiencies with reinvesting in growth. So the bottom line is we do expect our margins are going to continue to expand from here, from both our intentional actions, but also from an improvement in the cycle. Alex Scott : Got it. Okay. And then similar question on the expense ratio improvement that was part of the intermediate guide for the insurance businesses. How do we think about calculating that and understanding the way that that will influence the bottom line results across the different segments? Yanela Frias : Hey, Alex. This is Yanela. So, you know, the expense ratio, what I would start with is as of the full year 2024, we are already close to meeting the top end of that range. In terms of calculating it, we share in the materials how we calculate it. Now we don't currently disclose the split between variable and operating G&A, we will start doing that to help you calculate the ratio. But I would also speak to the fact that there has been upward pressure on our G&A, but that has been really driven by variable distribution expenses resulting from our strong sales. And these variable expenses have corresponding revenues that we generally have a positive impact on the operating expense ratio. So we do anticipate that over time, our continuous improvement approach and the investments that we're making to grow and transform our businesses will continue to contribute efficiencies which will be evident through the positive trends in the ratio over time. So that's what we expect in the ratio. I do want to go back to Jack's question on the runoff and the cash flow, though. So, yes, while I was speaking about the runoff, I was speaking about the impact on core earnings. But runoff also does impact cash flows because that obviously, the fees that we receive on those legacy variable annuities is also going away. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Mike Ward from UBS. Your line is now live. Mike Ward : Hey, thank you. Good morning. One question just on the life sales, pretty big jump in sales in the quarter. Wondering, you know, what product lines that was in and if we're seeing that big growth, like, if it's estate planning, could sales could that actually open up for a little bit more earnings volatility going forward? Thanks. Caroline Feeney : Sure. Mike, it's Caroline, and I'll take your question. So as you say, our individual life business finished the year strong. We had record sales of over $325 million in the fourth quarter, which is an increase of 60% over the prior year quarter. For the full year, Mike, our sales were up nearly 25% versus the prior year. And most importantly, you asked about product and where we're seeing that. We're actually achieving those sales increases across virtually every product. Our well-diversified portfolio while continuing to generate attractive returns. You also mentioned estate planning and the significant sales increase we saw this past quarter did benefit from some increase to estate planning activity. I don't think that that brings any additional volatility to us. What I would say is I think it's quite possible that we may continue to see some of our customers continue to focus here based on a couple of macro factors that are driving this activity. Overall, Mike, we're very pleased in the growth and the quality of our Life New business. The last point that I will note is that we are seeing a flight to quality across the industry. And we are well-positioned to continue to benefit, thanks to our established brand and our distribution strength. Mike Ward : Great. Thank you. Thank you so much. That's helpful. Maybe on the capital strain, Yanela, I know you clarified this, but I would have thought that there's at least some sort of capital release or release upon runoff business. I'm guessing it's sort of just the operating or the fees are a more significant component, but any clarity on that would be helpful. Thanks. Yanela Frias : Yeah. No. When there's runoff, there's capital release, but we are also reinvesting capital into the growth of the business and the new sales. So, you know, when we talk about 30% to 40% of organic growth funding, that includes, you know, the piece that we're freeing up and the cash flows we're generating. Operator : Okay. Thanks. Thank you. Next question is coming from Wilma Burdis from Raymond James. Your line is now live. Wilma Burdis : Hey, good morning. Could you talk about the more margins in Japan and the potential opportunities to free up some of that capital? And along the same lines, can you talk about why Prismic reinsured a more recent block of business from Japan when the legacy products are more pressured by ESR just maybe talk about the goals there. Thanks. Rob Falzon : Wilma, it's Rob. I'll jump in on the second part of that question first and then someone might want to jump in on the first part. With respect to the block that we selected for Prismic and treatment under ESR, what I would note is that it was, again, a longer duration dollar-denominated product. And so under ESR, that is in fact the type of product where we have significant margins, but those margins aren't necessarily reflected well in the, you know, from an economic standpoint under ESR. And so it actually presented itself as a good test case block for us given that our view is across the industry that type of product, meaning dollar-denominated longer duration, is the area where people where other players in the marketplace will be feeling some strain under ESR. And therefore a good opportunity for us to sort of get the pipes set up, demonstrate that we could do it, and learn from that process and create the credibility we need for third parties as well. With respect to your first quarter on mortality margins, maybe Andy wants to jump in on that part of the question? Andy Sullivan : Yeah. And Wilma, I'll be upfront. I didn't fully follow what you meant by question. But what I would tell you is our morbidity experience in Japan has been within our expected ranges. And as I said earlier, what we've really been experiencing in the underwriting line is the enhanced headwinds and pressure from a surrender perspective. But that being said, we've done a lot of work to broaden out our product portfolios. We've been very successful at enhancing our yen offerings, and that's really shown the strength in sales over the last couple of years. Wilma Burdis : Okay. Thank you. And then just trying to put a little bit of finer point on 2025. We expect the EPS growth to be at the lower end of the 5% to 8% EPS range or even more weighted toward the back half of that 2027 range. Thanks. Yanela Frias : Yeah. Wilma, it's Yanela. So as I mentioned, it's not linear. And, also, we have the near-term headwinds. So if you take into account near-term headwinds, then I would say, yes, 2025 being closer to the near term would have higher headwinds than the out years. Operator : Thank you. Next question is a follow-up from Wes Carmichael from Autonomous Research. Your line is now live. Wes Carmichael : Hey. Thanks so much for taking my follow-up. Andy, you just mentioned on surrender activity in Japan, I just wanted to touch on that for a second. That's been impacted, I think, by the move in the yen. And in your assumptions, you're assuming a pretty meaningful strengthening of the yen dollars at 135. So, you know, I guess, can you talk about what we might see or how to expect that to play out in guidance if you don't see a pretty significant strengthening in the yen? Andy Sullivan : Yeah. Wes. Let me take that in a couple parts. So first, let me take the guidance around the assumption of the yen going to 135. So that our yen assumption is really based on the forward curve. And as we sit here today and look at that, that sets in and around 135. So the market believes the yen will appreciate based on both economic growth in Japan and the interest rate increases in Japan. You know? But I would remind you, you know, to no matter which way these yen rates go, we've been intentionally diversifying the portfolio, as I just said. And our yen sales in Japan as a percent of the total are up 10% year over year to 35%. So we do expect these surrender headwinds to lessen as we look forward and, again, to appreciate, given the environment. But no matter which way those go, we have a broad set of offerings across yen and US dollar, and we know that demand for our products is going to stay strong. Wes Carmichael : Oh, thank you. That's really helpful. And I guess my last follow-up on individual life underwriting, you know, was a little bit worse in the quarter. But if I look back over the past couple of years, it's been a pretty meaningful headwind as you call it out in your slides. So I realize there's some seasonality and you guys have done a couple transactions, but can you give us any help on, you know, how you're expecting to kind of get that back to headline profitability? Caroline Feeney : Yes. So I'll take your questions, Caroline. So for this past quarter, as Charlie mentioned in his opening comments, we had several large case claims from permanent policies from our legacy Hartford block. And so this resulted in the adverse mortality, that negative underwriting that you saw, which can happen episodically. What I would say though in terms of underwriting overall more broadly, we do continue to see encouraging signs that COVID-19 has transitioned to an endemic state with more predictable seasonal fluctuations in mortality such as what we typically see during the flu season. The other thing that I would add, Wes, is clearly you have seen us continue to successfully execute on our strategy to reduce market sensitivity and increase capital flexibility with actually derisking and now reducing the size of our GUL in force by roughly 60%. So we are very pleased with the transactions we've completed. We will continue to be very proactive in terms of managing our in-force block of business. And so that is a major priority for us. And so our derisking transactions have gone a long way towards moving out patient. Operator : Thank you. We've reached the end of our question and answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lowrey for any further or closing comments. Charlie Lowrey : Thank you, and thank you for joining us today. I'll close with a few final thoughts. It has been a privilege to lead Prudential Financial, Inc. as CEO for the past six years. I'm proud of what we've accomplished to become a higher growth and more capital-efficient company that is well-positioned for long-term sustainable growth. And I offer my profound thanks to our employees around the world who care for our customers, our clients, our communities, and for each other every day. I'm confident that this will continue under the next generation of leadership and I look forward to supporting Andy and the leadership team in my role as executive chairman. Thank you for joining our call today and for your time. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",
