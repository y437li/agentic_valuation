My name is Sherlon and I will be your coordinator. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Until we conduct a question-and-answer-session following the presentation. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would like to now turn the conference over to Ms. Jill Sullivan Greer, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Jill Sullivan Greer : Thanks Sherlon. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us on our March quarter call. Speaking on the call today will be Richard Anderson, Delta\u2019s CEO, Ed Bastian, our President and Paul Jacobson our Chief Financial Officer. Richard will open the call, Ed will then address our financial and revenue performance, and Paul will conclude with a review of cost performance and cash flow. We have the entire leadership team here with us in the room for the Q&A session. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. And you can find the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measure on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I will turn the call over to our CEO, Richard Anderson. Richard H. Anderson: Good morning. I want to take a minute to introduce our new Chief Operating Officer, Gil West. Gil is a 28 year industry veteran including his most recent position as Delta\u2019s Senior Vice President for Airport Customer Service and Technical Operations. He is a great leader and he\u2019s led the tremendous performance at Delta in completion track the baggage, on time customer service and our non-fuel CASM performance. He is a good friend and we congratulate him on his promotion. We also huge owe a huge thanks to a really dear old friend Steve Gorman for his outstanding carrier as the Chief Operating Officer at Delta. We missed his friendship, leadership and of course his always unique point of view. We wish him best in his well earned retirement. This morning we reported a $444 million pre-tax profit for the March quarter, which is an increase of $363 million over last year. We earned $0.33 per share beating consensus by $0.04. We grew our top line 5%, grew unit revenues 3.2%, kept our non-fuel CASM at 0.3% and expanded our operating margin by 4.4 points to 7.9%. We generated $390 million of free cash flow, reduced our net debt to $9.1 billion and returned a $176 million to our owners through dividends and share repurchases. Our March quarter performance is remarkable because the severe weather in January and February reduced our pre-tax by $55 million. But for the weather, we would have had $500 million pre-tax profit in the seasonally most difficult quarter of the year, and that says a lot about the franchise we have here at Delta. I want to take a moment to recognize the extraordinary efforts of all the people at work at Delta. We canceled about 17,000 flights in the first two months of the year due to weather. Through it all, our people stayed focused on taking great care of our customers which helped produced the highest customer satisfaction scores of any network carrier and a record March quarter profit. Our operating performance in customer service across the board is fully rebounded at the top of the industry. And as a result, we\u2019ve accrued $99 million for our 2014 profit sharing program. I think these numbers reflect a resilient foundation that\u2019s really based upon the creativity and execution of the people at Delta. Despite the weather in the quarter, we met or exceeded our guidance for mid January on margin, revenue and costs. That\u2019s because we\u2019re determined to be a consistently high performing S&P 500 company that deserves the trust of long-term investors. We are focused on the significant opportunities ahead, as we continue to transform Delta. And let me reiterate on our long-term goals, 10% to 12% annual operating margin, 10% to 15% EPS growth, 15% ROIC, return on invested capital. $5 billion operating cash flow with 50% reinvested in Delta, and we\u2019re going to operate company under investment-grade balance sheet metrics with a target of $7 billion in net debt. In 2014, we\u2019ll meet these goals again as we\u2019re forecasting another year of significant earnings improvement, margin expansion and cash generation. The demand environment remained strong as we expect single-digit unit revenue increases in Q2 on 2% to 3% capacity increases. Fuel prices are relatively stable and we have a significant positive fuel hedge book for the year. We are building additional momentum through our revenue fee ancillary businesses and aviation related businesses which all are performing quite well. We are confident about our ability over the long-term to maintain a non-fuel cost structure with sub 2% y-o-y growth and significant non-op benefits from debt reduction. These strategies are expected to produce a June quarter operating margin of 14% to 16%. This company is run through long-term shareholder value. We measure our return on invested capital with a goal of generating at least 15% return on invested capital, which is nearly double our weighted average cost of capital. This requires not only a focus on earnings, but also strict discipline around capital deployment. Our Board of Directors under our Chairman, Dan Carp, is exacting in requiring management to prove returns for every dollar we invest. Management micro manager\u2019s capital expenditures as we required internal rate of return well above our return on invested capital with rapid paybacks. Long-term executive compensation and management compensation throughout the Company is tied to achieving the 15% return on invested capital. Our owners have entrusted us with their money and we promise to be good stewards. Our fleet strategy is a good example of prudent capital deployment. In addition to 19 new 737-900s this year, which were cash flow positive day one, we\u2019ll take delivery of 42 717s this year. These aircraft have at least 12 to 20 years of useful life and a cost substantially less than $10 million a copy without a dollar of upfront investments by Delta to bring them into the fleet. This approach to refleeting will drive margin expansion at a lower capital cost. This strategy has produced a 16.4% return on invested capital for Delta over the last 12 months. We will consistently improve our free cash flow. The cash generation of this business is in the top tier of the S&P 500. We expect to produce more than $5 billion of operating cash flow in 2014 with more than $3 billion of free cash flow. This puts our free cash flow yield north of 10%. Our cash generation over the last year has allowed us to accelerate all aspects for our capital deployment plan. Our adjusted net debt is $9.1 billion and we are on track to reach $7 billion in net debt next year two years ahead of schedule. We made $500 million of incremental contributions to our pension and have reduced the unfunded liability by nearly 25% to just over $10 billion. And we have returned $525 million in cash to our owners through dividends in buybacks in the last nine months. And expect to complete our $500 million repurchase authorization two years ahead of schedule. A year-ago in April 2013, our Board adopted a five year plan, which included our shareholder return strategy. We expect by the end of 2014 to have achieved the goals in that plan three years early. Our board and management are in the process of determining the next phase of our shareholder returns and we look forward to publicly announcing that strategy and discussing our new five year plan in early May, just as we did last year. So across the board our performance is the Delta standard for the industry, while rivaling that of other high-quality industrial transports. We run our business on the same metrics as high-quality S&P 500 industrial transports with the same kind of discipline, determined decision-making you see from fine well-run companies. We have a lot of work ahead of us, but also significant opportunity. I want to just take one minute because we haven\u2019t done this before, and I want to thank Jill Greer and Bonita Reynolds-Bailey for putting up with us in the process every quarter of producing our press release and our earnings material, and I want to thank them. I think we have the best IR team in the industry. With that, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Ed. Edward H. Bastian:  Well, thanks, Richard. Good morning, everyone. Appreciate you joining us today. This morning, as Richard said, we reported a pre-tax profit for the quarter of $444 million, which was $363 million higher than last year\u2019s March quarter. Our op margin expanded by 440 basis points to 7.9%, and given the introduction this quarter of non-cash book tax expense, we believe pre-tax results provide the best year-over-year comparison of our performance. Our net profits of $281 million or $0.33 per share beat consensus by $0.04. We achieved these results despite the impact of the severe storms in January and February, including two storms that shut down our major hub in Atlanta for several days, costing us $90 million in revenue and $55 million in pre-tax profits. I\u2019ll join Richard in also thanking the Delta team for their dedication and determination in producing great operational performance, customer satisfaction and financial results during a very tough quarter. The Delta people continue to prove they are the very best in the business. On the revenue front, we are seeing a solid demand environment, which produced revenue growth of 5% or $416 million despite the $90 million revenue loss due to weather. Our passenger revenues grew 5% on a 1.7% increase in capacity. We\u2019re seeing solid gains in the corporate space with corporate contract revenues up 6% for the quarter. We did see some weather impact on corporates in January and February, but demand rebounded in March and our corporate revenues were up in the 8% range for the last four weeks led by double-digit gains in the financial services, automotive and media sectors. Passenger unit revenues increased 3.2%, driven by both higher loads and yields. There was about 0.5 point RASM benefit in the quarter from the storm cancellations. We saw our best unit revenue performance in the domestic system, which increased 6%. We saw particular strength in hub-to-hub flying, continued strong results in Atlanta and importantly, both Los Angeles and Seattle delivered high-single digit unit revenue improvement on double-digit capacity growth. In fact, Seattle had the highest domestic unit revenue gain of any of our hubs for the quarter. Internationally, trans-Atlantic was our best performing entity despite the impact of the shift of Easter into April. Unit revenues increased to 0.5 point was about up 2 points of RASM pressure from the Easter shift. The revenue improvement was driven by a combination of yield improvement and higher loads on 1.5% lower capacity. Latin unit revenues were flat as we absorbed an 18% increase in capacity primarily to Mexico and Brazil to improve connectivity with our partners Aeromexico and GOL. In the Pacific, our unit revenues were down 5% on flat capacity. The yen weakened 11% year-over-year, moving from 92 in the first quarter of 2013 to its current level of around 102. This weakness drove a $54 million decrease in revenues, but the bulk of that was offset by our hedges as well as savings and expense. You should note our yen hedge book at the end of March had a value of $118 million. One bright area in the Pacific portfolio has been China, with all of our China market showing year-over-year unit revenue gains despite a 15% capacity increase. Looking forward to the June quarter, we expect to continue the trend of top line growth and margin expansion. We are expecting a solid increase in unit revenues on 2% to 3% higher capacity. The late calendar replacement of these through this year has shifted that holiday\u2019s traditional travel from March to April, and we are seeing currently April unit revenues up in the 6% range. Our forward expectations for May and June are strong, with both months showing unit revenues up in the 5% to 7% range. This solid demand environment coupled with the success we\u2019ve had with our cost initiatives and the declining fuel price point to an operating margin of 14% to 16% throughout the midpoint is 400 basis points of expansion over last year\u2019s 11% margin. Looking beyond the June quarter, we see a number of sources of profitable revenue growth, which we\u2019ve been aggressively investing in over the last six years. First, our investments in the network, product and operations are producing solid, sustainable revenue gains, but there is more room for growth. We have recently completed our full flat-bed installation and business elite across our entire international widebody fleet, becoming the only U.S. carrier to offer this service with direct-aisle access. And we are also now the only U.S. carrier to offer personal on-demand entertainment at every seat in all long-haul international flights. Our product and service investments are especially important to our corporate customers and a large driver of our 107% revenue premium to the industry. And not only are we continuing to see gains in corporate share, overall corporate travel spend is expected to increase. Our most recent corporate travel survey show that nearly 85% of corporate travel managers expect their spend will increase on Delta in 2014. Our initiatives in New York are also delivering results and we\u2019re on track to bring our entire New York franchise to profitability this year. New York unit revenues increased 5% on 2.6% higher capacity in the March quarter. This was a significant achievement as the region was particularly impacted by the Easter shift. We are seeing RASM improvements in the double digits for April in New York. All of our New York to L.A. flights will feature our premium flat-bed products starting July 1. We\u2019re also gaining good traction with New York corporates with the expansion of our Heathrow service through our joint venture with Virgin Atlantic. We officially launched our immunized JV with Virgin on January 1. We\u2019re now coordinating on pricing, scheduling and capacity with the introduction of the first combined schedule on March 30. We\u2019ve also co-located our departures to New York, Boston and Seattle at Terminal 3 at Heathrow, offering Delta customers access to more amenities including the Virgin Clubhouse. Customer response has been overwhelmingly positive. Our non-operating expense this quarter includes a $31 million charge for our share of Virgin Atlantic\u2019s March quarter loss. This is the seasonally weakest quarter of the year for Virgin and we expect they will deliver standalone profitability in 2014 providing non-operating benefit to us for the full year. Our Seattle expansion is a key part of our Pacific network restructuring. We\u2019re pleased with our performance so far in Seattle with unit revenues improving in the quarter despite a 17% increase in capacity, which helped drive several points of margin expansion. Connecting traffic now accounts for 65% of our current Seattle flows, a trend we see increasing as we mature our service to Hong Kong, Seoul and London. And finally, another important area of revenue opportunity is our merchandising efforts. These are products and services that allow customers to tailor their travel experience and approve their overall satisfaction while also increasing our revenue. Products like Economy Comfort, First Class Upsell and Priority Boarding grew 20% year-over-year to a $165 million in the March quarter. Our First Class Upsell product helped increase our paid first class load factor by 5 points to 45%. We think we can grow this high margin revenue stream by $500 million annually over the next three years. I\u2019ll wrap up here by simply stating that while we are pleased with the type of results we\u2019re producing, we\u2019re even more excited about the opportunities that lay in front of us. With that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Paul. Paul A. Jacobson:  Thank you, Ed and good morning everybody. Our cost performance this quarter truly reflects the great work by the entire Delta team. Our total operating expenses increased $13 million driven by the impact of employee investments including $99 million of profit sharing expense during the quarter. These cost increases were almost fully offset by lower fuel expense savings from our productivity initiatives and receipt of a $25 million insurance claim related to Superstorm Sandy. On the unit cost basis, our non-fuel unit cost increased only 0.3% despite one point of cost pressure from storm cancellations. When we affirmed our cost guidance in March, we said we expected unit cost to increase more than 1%. The drivers of our out performance versus that is to estimate with the finalization of the Sandy insurance claim during the quarter, and higher than expected completion factor in the month of March, which drove slightly more capacity for the quarter. This is now the third consecutive quarter that we have kept our non-fuel unit cost growth below 2% in line with our longer term cost commitment. With good momentum behind us, we have a number of initiatives in place that should continue to allow us to sustain this rate of growth. We\u2019re also making prudent investments in our employees products and operations. The biggest initiative under way is our domestic refleeting. We took delivery of 24 aircraft this quarter and retired 15 mainline planes in 16 50-seat regional jets. We are on track to retire more than 70 50-seaters this year, which would put that fleet below 200 aircraft at the end of the year. The refleeting gives us a strong tailwind on unit cost as we leverage our scale to produce capacity much more efficiently. For the March quarter, we generated 0.4 higher domestic capacity and 5.2% fewer departures. In addition to the maintenance savings from retiring the 50-seaters. This trend will continue for the next few years as we move through the refleeting project. On the fuel side, our fuel cost of $3.03 per gallon this quarter included $107 million in hedge gains, which help to offset direct losses at the refinery. For the March quarter operations at the refinery produced a $41 million loss. Production was reduced during the quarter as we shut down one of our crude units for scheduled modifications. These modifications to the crude unit are part of our initiative to increase the production of higher value distillates intellect jet and diesel, which we expect to account for roughly 50% of the production slate at Trainer going forward. Our other major initiative at Trainer is domestic crude sourcing which accounted for 50,000 barrels per day of Trainer\u2019s needs during the quarter. We expect this to continue ramp up to a full year average of 70,000 barrels per day for 2014. Though the first quarter tends to be weak for the refining space, rising RINs expense contributed to the refinery\u2019s loss. We\u2019re continuing our efforts to work with the EPA to address this issue. And we expect both the refinery and our hedge book to reduce our fuel cost for the upcoming quarter. We\u2019re projecting a fuel price for the June quarter of $2.97 to $3.02 per gallon including refinery benefits and $100 million of hedge gains. Our non-operating expense for the quarter included a $23 million charge associated with the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar for transactions related to 2014. When the reversal of our tax valuation allowance at the end of last year, our net profit was reduced to reflect a 36% tax rate for the quarter. However, we have minimal cash tax obligations due to our $15 billion NOL balance. As Richard mentioned earlier, we are transforming Delta into a high quality industrial company. And two of the important ways we\u2019ll do that are through our balance sheet and our cash flows. On the cash flow side, we have strong cash generation from the business as Richard mentioned. We generated more than $950 million of operating cash flow during the quarter. A solid result, but even more so given that it is net of more than $600 million in pension funding and $500 million in profit sharing payouts during the quarter. In early April, we contributed another $300 million to the pension completing both our $655 million of prior funding, plus $250 million of additional funding. These payments will complete all of our funding for 2014. Our CapEx for the quarter was $570 million, which include a $275 million in aircraft purchases and $165 million in aircraft modifications. This resulted in $390 million of free cash flow for the quarter. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $9.1 billion of adjusted net debt and a debt to total capital ratio of 44%. The debt reduction is moving our balance sheet closer to investment-grade metrics. And it\u2019s also driving P&L benefit through lower interest expense. Our interest expense declined by $34 million in the March quarter and we expect to save more than $100 million for 2014. We are on track to reach our $7 billion debt target next year, which will put us on a run rate of $500 million in annual interest expense, down from $750 million in 2014. During the quarter, we continued with the accelerated pace of capital returns, sending back $176 million to our owners through dividends and buybacks. We repurchased 4 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $30.94 per total of $125 million. We\u2019ve now completed $375 million of our $500 million authorization and expect to complete that authorization during the June quarter. Let me close by saying thank you to the entire Delta team for their contributions this quarter. It is their dedication and determination that really drives our results and makes Delta the airline of choice for customers and our investors. With that I\u2019ll turn it back to Jill. Jill Sullivan Greer : Thanks Richard, Ed and Paul. Sherlon, we are now already to go to the Q&A session, if you could give everybody their instructions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll have our first question from Jamie Baker, JPMorgan. Jamie N. Baker \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC :  Hey, good morning everybody. First question relates to the pilots, and I realize it\u2019s a little bit early to be asking given the contract runs through next year. But, when you achieved the current contract you had pretty clear asks, you needed improved access to large RJs. You needed better mechanism to facilitate a 50-seat retirements and of course, the 717 was a component of the current contracts. So, as we look forward and ponder what the pilot ask might be for 2016 and beyond. It isn't clear to me that you're in a stronger position to negotiate it, it isn't clear what the management incrementally needs. Is there something we need to be concerned about? Edward H. Bastian: Well. No, you shouldn\u2019t be concerned about it, simply because of our track record. I think if you look back over the past eight years, we've always been able to partner with our pilots and figure out what we need to do to keep Delta at the top of the industry. And while we don't talk specifically about how or when we engage and what we talk about, our track record is the best in the industry in that regard. Jamie N. Baker \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC :  Okay. I'd agree with that. Richard, while I have you, on the 10% to 12% annual operating margin target through the business cycle, or the 15% ROIC, whatever metric you choose? The question I still get from investors is whether Delta is simply going to start growing again, once you achieve these targets? And as you know, the Seattle expansion has made some of your owners a bit nervous as it relates to capacity discipline, it's not my view, but I know you've had to confront it. Should we view the achievement of your financial target as an implicit license to start growing again? Or is there a different more shareholder friendly outcome? Richard H. Anderson: Well, if you listen to my initial remarks closely, they were all geared toward making the shareholder the priority in our decision-making queue. And if you look at our capacity management over the past decade, it's been the most disciplined and will continue to be the most disciplined. And as we said at our annual Investor Day last December the growth that we are putting in the marketplace today is below GDP estimated growth. And second, we're actually doing what we're doing with fewer shells. This quarter, we operated with seven fewer total airplanes in the fleet. So that will continue to be the kind of discipline that we have at Delta because we are focused on return \u2013 not just return, but for the whole airline, we like to look at returns by fleet and by sub-fleet. Jamie N. Baker \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC : Excellent, always helpful to hear. Thank you, gentlemen. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Michael Linenberg, Deutsche Bank. Michael J. Linenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.:  Yes, hey. Good morning, everyone. Just two questions here. I just I want to go back to the miscellaneous expense, the $81 million. I guess $23 million of that is I guess the impact from the Venezuelan bolivar and then there's the $31 million from Virgin. What's the other piece? Then what was the Virgin, that $31 million, how did that compared to the March quarter of 2013? Paul A. Jacobson: Mike, it\u2019s Paul. There is other FX-related pressure in that miscellaneous income number that we see, but we called out the largest pieces of that. Michael J. Linenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Good. And then just on the Virgin year-over-year improvement or I should say whatever was versus a year ago, do you have that number? Paul A. Jacobson:  Well, we didn\u2019t close, Mike is that. We didn\u2019t close to \u2013 I think it was end of June last year. So we didn\u2019t have the first quarter contribution, but as I said in my remarks, we expect they are going to be profitable to standalone for the full year. So it's going to be an uplift in our reduction actually in our non-op expense. Michael Linenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. And then just a second question here. As one who follows GOL and Aeromexico, one of the things that we've seen at both those companies is that they've seen a significant improvement in how they really produce revenue. And when you talk to those management teams, they talk about the help that they've received from Delta. You know the fact that, you know they have the opportunity to learn the best practices from one of the best carriers out there and my question is, when we saw those investments, they seem sort of more as one-off type deals, but as you sort of look around the globe, are there other opportunities where strategically, it would make sense to replicate what you\u2019re doing with Aeromexico and GOL and I realize I don\u2019t want to sort of exclude Virgin Atlantic from that? Of course you\u2019re doing that at Virgin Atlantic. But are there other opportunities like that? Richard H. Anderson: Mike, this is Richard. As to your second question, we wouldn\u2019t answer it on the call anyway, because that\u2019s kind of like doing the Virgin transaction or the Aeromexico transaction or the GOL transaction. We\u2019re not going to discuss that publicly. But I think the reason, I mean candidly, one of the reason why those firms are doing well is heads on both their boards. Michael Linenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Very good. All right, well thank you. Richard H. Anderson: By the way Steve Gorman is on the Aeromexico board. Operator : , : John D. Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC:  Hey. Thank you for taking my question. I think the team has done a great job of reframing the focus toward operating margin. So just building on that, I think when we look at the normal seasonality of the business over the last few years even regardless of the Easter shift, the third quarter has tended to have even better margins than the second quarter in a fuel cooperative environment. Is that the right framework? Richard H. Anderson: John, we\u2019re not giving third quarter guidance on this call. Obviously, the momentum is strong in the business and there will be a time to talk about that, but it\u2019s not now. John D. Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Fair enough. I was hoping the team could also elaborate a bit on the aircraft RFP. There were some comments, I think, in the press about a hopeful outlook on the A330 NEO. On the other hand of course the team is very ROIC focused, and I guess there is a third component to that how it relates to the long-term CapEx guidance that you\u2019ve all spoken to. Richard H. Anderson: Well, we are just testing the market and it will be a pretty long process to see whether there is anything that makes sense from an ROIC standpoint, and the number could be, it could be a lot less than the number that we\u2019ve talked about there. It just depends on what happens when we get the RFP responses back. And what we\u2019ve said in our long-term guidance, it remains unchanged. We\u2019re finished with all the flat-bed mods and you saw this year we\u2019re down at \u2013 we\u2019re at a number of about $2.3 billion in CapEx. So, we\u2019re going to continue to make certain that whatever investments we do make are consistent with what you\u2019ve seen us do in terms of return on invested capital and returning capital to shareholders. John D. Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to David Fintzen, Barclays. David E. Fintzen \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.:  Hey, good morning everyone. Just a question, kind of I guess on the wide RFP, but more conceptual. You\u2019ve obviously gotten a lot of CASM benefit with the regional up-gauging and the domestic up-gauging. Are there similar long-term opportunities in international to move towards bigger airplanes or is that a market that\u2019s more fragmented and you actually end up moving down in aircraft size? Just kind of curious how that plays through CASM over the next many years? Edward H. Bastian: Talking about the causes \u2013 this is Ed, David; I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s a huge up-gauge strategy on the international. Certainly there\u2019s a big CASM benefit as we look at the fuel efficiency of the new aircraft. We do operate a large fleet of 747s. So we would expect those would be candidates for replacement in this next cycle. If anything, we\u2019d be down-gauging a bit there, but certainly picking up a very nice CASM return, probably thinking somewhere in the orders of 20% to 25% more fuel efficiency on the new aircraft. David E. Fintzen \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then just, as we\u2019re looking at particularly Seattle and the development of the international there, I mean how should we think about kind of the spool up curve for new international flying? I mean historically it\u2019s been two to three years to kind of get that flying up to system average. Is that the kind of the right way to think about Seattle or is that something you think can develop much quicker? Glen W. Hauenstein: This is Glen. How are you doing? David E. Fintzen \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good. Good, Glen. Thanks. Glen W. Hauenstein:  Well, we\u2019ve been very excited about the spool in Seattle so far. As a matter of fact in the month of March, all of our new domestic markets were segment profitable and Seattle\u2019s margin improved by 8 margin points year-over-year despite a 22% increase in revenue. So we\u2019re off to a great start, and we have a lot more to go in Seattle. So we\u2019re looking forward to those all coming online over the next few months. And we do expect to become Seattle\u2019s largest carrier in terms of revenues in the third quarter of this year. So we\u2019re well ahead of our own internal forecast on Seattle and we\u2019re pretty excited about the early returns. David E. Fintzen \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, great. That sounds very helpful. Thanks. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Savi Syth, Raymond James Savanthi Syth \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.:  Hey, good morning. Just wondering, how much of a benefit in this hub-to-hub flying and just domestic unit revenue are you seeing from the Virgin partnership right now? And is that some of the $120 million that you had projected in synergies or is that $120 million yet to come? Edward H. Bastian: Savi, this is Edward. We\u2019re certainly starting to see some benefits. I think it\u2019s very early. I\u2019d say it\u2019s very early obviously since we just launched the JV as of the first of the year and we had ATI granted not until late last year. So the $120 million of synergies is the combination of the JV and the revenue benefits that the partnership will bring us as well as our share of the earnings of Virgin Atlantic going forward. It\u2019s certainly benefiting our New York Heathrow P&L considerably and we expect over the next two years you\u2019re going to see a pretty quick ramp up of those benefits. Savanthi Syth \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, understood. And I apologize for the overhead noise. I\u2019m in an airport right now. But just a follow-up question on the refinery, has the upgrade work been completed, and is expectation still that it will be somewhat profitable in the second quarter and maybe profitable in the year? Paul A. Jacobson: Good morning, Savi. This is Paul. The upgraded work has been completed. We have been producing approximately 50% distillate products throughout the month of March. We do expect that we will be profitable in the June quarter. Savanthi Syth \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Got it. All right, thanks so much. Operator :  Our next question comes from Glenn Engel, Bank of America. Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Good morning. Couple of question, please. One, the revenue was up 8% in the first quarter, you said mainly SkyMiles. Is that type of strength likely to continue? Richard H. Anderson: Yes, we do expect to see some continuing improvements in our SkyMiles program, not just the benefits of the relationship with Amex, but in the future the changes that we\u2019re going to be making back to our frequent flyer activities. We also got some benefits in the quarter from our JV relationships, particularly in Europe. Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : That shows up in the other revenue line? Richard H. Anderson: Yes. Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And when I looked on the expense side, on the contract, the regional jet capacity cost, it was down 4%. That was in line with capacity, down 4%. I guess it surprises me. With all the cancellations I would expect to see cost pressures on a unit basis on the regional side. Why didn\u2019t that occur? Paul A. Jacobson: Glenn, this is Paul. That\u2019s going to be offset by maintenance savings as a result of the retirement of the 50-seaters, will offset some of that pressure. Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Is maintenance cost likely to be more level this year than it has been in the past where it\u2019s been much more frontend loaded? Paul A. Jacobson: Yes. I think as we talked about at Investor Day, we expected maintenance CASM to be flat for the year. I think due to timing there is a little bit of extra business in the first quarter, but generally around flat for the year. Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And finally, where did the $25 million Sandy or credit show up? Paul A. Jacobson: In other expense. Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator :  Our next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen. Helane R. Becker \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC: Thanks very much operator. Hi, everybody. Thank you for the time. I just have a couple of questions and one point of clarification. When you talk about RASM, are you talking about total RASM or just passenger RASM? Richard H. Anderson: Generally passenger RASM. Helane R. Becker \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. Thank you. And then just on the new pilot rules that went into effect in early January. Can you just talk about where the cost associated from that would be and whether or not \u2013 and how you\u2019re able to handle that successfully? Richard H. Anderson: We\u2019ve been able to handle it from an operating perspective incredibly successfully, and Jill how many perfect completion factor days do we have? Paul A. Jacobson: We\u2019ve got 24 year-to-date. Richard H. Anderson: We have 24 perfect completion factor days year-to-date. And we\u2019ve been able to manage through that actually quite effectively because the way our pilot agreement was already set up, we had a fair amount of flexibility in terms of being able to manage to the new rules and we put a lot of work into our systems and our planning in advance of 117. In fact, we asked the FAA to let us start a little bit early so that we could have it for the full month of January for the purposes of planning. So you see it or not, we don\u2019t break out separately that kind of detail in our non-fuel CASM, but you can see overall our non-fuel CASM in the quarter was excellent. Glen W. Hauenstein: I would just also add that practically our operational control center manages that on a daily basis to mitigate the impact. Helane R. Becker \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay, great. Thank you. And then can I just ask one other question? I saw yesterday a letter that the airport at Atlanta sent to, I guess, a bunch of the international airlines kind of looking around to expand their international service, to ask other airlines to expand internationally into Atlanta. And I\u2019m just wondering if they do this incentive program that they are talking about, can you actually participate in that as one of the larger international airlines there? Richard H. Anderson: Yes, we will participate and we\u2019re eligible to participate in the program and plan on being able to qualify for much of the $2 million in grants. Helane R. Becker \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC: Great. Okay and that would show up I guess in what passenger revenue or that would just\u2026 Richard H. Anderson:  No, it's rents and landing fees. It's a reduction. The way it's properly accounted for is \u2013 it will just be a straight reduction in rents and landing fees, but we don't call that out by airport. So you are not going to be able to see it in the P&L. Helane R. Becker \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC:  And it\u2019s a small number but still I mean you might as well take advantage of that if you can get it. Richard H. Anderson: Although Atlanta is by far the most efficient airport to land an airplane in the United States, I think our landing fee to give you an idea, our landing fee cost in Atlanta are half of what Miami is. Helane R. Becker \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC: Awesome that\u2019s really great. Thank you so much for your help. Operator :  Our next question comes from Dan McKenzie, Buckingham Research. Dan J. McKenzie \u2013 The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.:  Hey, good morning everybody. Thanks for the time. I guess first congrats to Ben and team on winning a legal case in Italy, I think investors are breathing a huge sigh of relief. But a couple of questions here; one, what\u2019s driving the strength to China. Is the strength coming primarily from new accounts, or call it corporate share gains. Or is it more that your existing accounts are just simply investing more heavily in the country. Any additional color here would be greatly appreciated? Edward H. Bastian: We see very strong demand for corporates to China through the first quarter and we also were able to achieve a re-time of one of our Beijing slots from an un-preferred time to repeat time channel, which had a very positive impact on the Beijing operations. So a combination that's continuing to work with our Chinese partners on improving our connectivity and our schedules to interior China, as well as a good strong core demand from the U.S. Dan J. McKenzie \u2013 The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.:  Okay, very good. Thank you. Second question here is, I'm wondering if you can help us peel back the onion on the fleet reguaging initiatives. I believe when you introduced the initiative originally, Delta was targeting $1 billion of structural cost savings. Wondering if you can help us or just share what that cost savings contribution was in the first quarter? Where are we, with respect to that $1 billion goal? And do the cost savings a straight line from there? Paul A. Jacobson: Hi, Dan this is Paul. Yes, when we outlined that $1 billion structural cost savings, there were a number of the buckets in there. Gauge was just one of them, which we had highlighted about $350 million a year of run rate benefits out of that program. We're probably still in the sort of early to middle stages of that process as we've just begun receiving and getting in a steady flow of 717s and some of the 7060 regional jet deliveries, so we still have more to come. Dan J. McKenzie \u2013 The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. Thanks everybody. Operator : Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth, Evercore. Duane Pfennigwerth \u2013 Evercore Partners, Inc.:  Hi, good morning, thanks. Just wanted to come back to this seasonality of earnings question, as you build out Seattle to Asia, restructure Japan, grow to Latin America. Is there any reason to expect at this point that the seasonality of your earnings has changed? Richard H. Anderson:  No, there is no reason to expect that to change. The changes within the network are not that material. Edward H. Bastian: But I do think what, you've seen us be able to do last year and this year is to be able to run a profitable cash flow positive business quarter-in and quarter-out, and that's very important for our investors. It's very important for being a member of the S&P 500. Duane Pfennigwerth \u2013 Evercore Partners, Inc.: Thanks for that. And then on the non-op line as we think about seasonality, can you give us any sense for the swing that you expect from Virgin as we approach their seasonally stronger quarters? Paul A. Jacobson: Well, their strength will fairly be in Q2 and Q3. I mentioned then we're expecting them to be profitable for the year, but we haven't given the guidance as to what that number is. So you can expect to see positive contributions in both Q2 and Q3, and hopefully Q4 as well. Duane Pfennigwerth \u2013 Evercore Partners, Inc.:  Thanks. And then, just lastly, on your 10% to 12% EBIT margin target, what happens if you exceed that in a given year? Does the target change? And thanks for taking the questions. Paul A. Jacobson: That expectation, Duane, is over the cycle. So we would expect certain years that we would be on the upper end of that range. Duane Pfennigwerth \u2013 Evercore Partners, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Thomas Kim, Goldman Sachs. Thomas Kim \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: I wanted to ask about the competitive environment on the Pacific and also with regards to the Pacific, can you help us break down the TransPac PRASM ex-Japan, what that would have looked like in Q1? Richard H. Anderson: Tom, we don't give that level of detail. We did say that China was positive and obviously our Japanese flying was the main source of the negative unit revenue driven by the yen devaluation. Thomas Kim \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And then just with regards to cargo, this has been an area where we've seen, I guess now a couple of years of weakness. Obviously not a huge part of the revenue, but it is one that's still a slight drag. And I was just wondering, if you can elaborate on what percentage of this is coming from domestic versus international, and are you seeing any signs that the cargo should recover? Thanks. Richard H. Anderson: We are not seeing much signs of recovery. It continues to be a very difficult. Most of our the cargo weaknesses coming on the international front versus the domestic front and there is a lot of yield and as well as tonnage pressure that it's not unique to Delta, as you are seeing it across not just the U.S. industry, you are seeing on a global scale. There is too much capacity, cargo capacity out there in a lot of these international markets. Thomas Kim \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right, okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe DeNardi, Stifel. Joe W. DeNardi \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, thanks good morning. A question for you Richard on the international margins, just curious to get your perspective on how you view that competitive dynamics there in general relative to domestic? Obviously, domestic is benefiting from all the consolidation capacity discipline. So, is all of the soft consolidation that's happened internationally in terms of JVs and alliances? Has that effectively changed the competitive landscape, so that it looks a little bit more like what you are seeing domestically or does international look a little bit more like what you saw at domestic maybe five or 10 years ago? Richard H. Anderson: International has gone through a pretty significant amount of consolidation, and if you just go by a region, when we look at our business down in Latin America, you had significant consolidation in Mexico. There is one single flag carrier in Mexico now and they are exclusive partners with Delta. You've had consolidation in South America with LAN-TAM merger, the Avianca-TACA merger, so the world is really evolving there very quickly in much the same way as the U.S. If you look in the trans-Atlantic, as Ed pointed out, that's been consistently our very best performer, and our immunized joint venture and the immunized joint ventures essentially have three global alliances now in that marketplace. And in Asia, when you look at the TransPac market, it's really clustered around the three alliances. So we\u2019ve seen a good market dynamics in the regions that we operate around the world and we continue to expect that worldwide consolidation will continue. Joe W. DeNardi \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay and then for Paul. At the Analyst Day, the CapEx outlook was more like $2 million to $2.5 million, now it's 50% of cash flow. Can you help me understand why that's the right way to frame it longer-term, rather than saying, this is what we need to invest and 75% or whatever the number is goes back to shareholders, I feel like that's more along the lines of what an industrials company would do, so interested to hear your thoughts on that. Paul A. Jacobson: Sure, Joe good morning. What we've outlined is 50% of CapEx as part of a broader, more balanced capital allocation strategy for all the cash that's generated inside the Company. I think that's been in line with that sort of $2 million to $2.5 million level, against the cash flow that we have been generating over time. So as we continue to evolve down that space, I think that's subject to continue modification for the size and the cash generation of the Company. Richard H. Anderson:  I would add one other thing; the great piece of discipline in our business is driving to a return on invested capital metric. Delta has shown a strong capability of hitting very high internal rate of return targets for a very measured investments internally. And I would focus on the return on invested capital number and making certain that we hold to that number and produce those kinds of returns on a consistent basis. Joe W. DeNardi \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.:  Okay, thanks guys. Jill Sullivan Greer :  And Sherlon, we are going to have time for one more question. Operator :  That will come from Hunter Keay, Wolfe Research. Hunter K. Keay \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, thanks again. Hey, Glen, how come you eliminated some of your checked bag fees on routes a couple of weeks ago? Glen W. Hauenstein: Hunter we\u2019re not going to answer that. Hunter K. Keay \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. How come Seattle was only 10% to 20% of connecting traffic three months ago, but now it's up to 65% of connecting traffic? How did that happen so fast? Edward H. Bastian: I don\u2019t think 10% to 15% was an accurate depiction I think it might have been a misunderstanding of what we were talking about last call, Hunter, that's got to be anything else, the full depth of our connecting close. Hunter K. Keay \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC : Okay thank you, Ed. And the question is, is there any revenues from the Virgin JV hitting the revenue line or is it all showing up in the non-op line and if there are revenues, are there also ASMs associated with it coming through? Richard H. Anderson: The revenues from the Virgin JV do show on the revenue line to the extent they are coming on Delta metal Virgin passengers, but most of the benefits at this point in time will show on the non-op line. Hunter K. Keay \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC : And are there ASMs associated with that Ed, and thanks a lot. Edward H. Bastian: No, we don\u2019t have any Virgin ASMs in our numbers. Hunter K. Keay \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, thank you. Jill Sullivan Greer :  That is going to conclude the analyst portion of the phone call. I'm going to turn the call over to Ned Walker for the media. John E. Walker:  Hey, thanks very much Jill. Sherlon, if you could review the steps for the media to ask a question. Also we would like to ask the media if it could limit it to one question and a quick follow-up, we should be able to accommodate most everyone. With that, we will turn it back to you, Sherlon. Operator :  (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll have our first question from Jack Nicas, The Wall Street Journal. Jack Nicas \u2013 The Wall Street Journal : Good morning, everyone thank you for the time. Richard, I was hoping you can speak to this. Can you discuss a bit about the accounting court ruling against Emirates, ruling that they could not fly from Milan to New York and how important that is for you guys and if Emirates tries that sort of flying with history of Emirates from other foreign countries to the U.S., is that something you guys are going to pursue legally and try to block that as well? Richard H. Anderson: Well, Fifth Freedoms under the Chicago Convention way back in the 1940s were never intended to be used the way that they were used in those circumstances. And so, we\u2019re optimistic that the decision of the Italian court will be a precedent that will be followed in other venues, because it was never the intention. The Fifth Freedoms were originally intended to take into account the range of airplanes to be able to fly nonstop, and it wasn\u2019t intended to in essence set up operations between two countries neither of which you are citizen of, so \u2013 as standalone operations. So we\u2019re pleased with the result and we will be very vigilant as an industry and being certain that these kinds of unbalanced trade activities from state-owned subsidized enterprises don\u2019t create an unfair trade environment. Jack Nicas \u2013 The Wall Street Journal :  Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Mary Schlangenstein, Bloomberg News. Mary Schlangenstein \u2013 Bloomberg News : Hi. I wanted to see if you could possible give us an update on your activity regarding the Ex-Im Bank and its reauthorization? And I also wanted to ask the supporters of the reauthorization of Ex-Im Bank. You said they\u2019re going to launch an all hands on deck effort to win the reauthorization, and I\u2019m just wondering how bigger role you see for Delta in opposing that? Richard H. Anderson: Well, we have played a significant role opposing it, and it\u2019s not so much the reauthorization. It\u2019s the bank needs to be reformed. There is no transparency around what it does with tax payers\u2019 money in the United States and it creates a huge subsidy for state-owned carriers in the United States. So in essence while we don\u2019t have any aviation Airline policy, co-gen airline policy in the United States, our treasury goes and we get a very good view of this, because the companies that we own interests in, down in Brazil and Aeromexico, we get a pretty good glimpse of the kinds of financings that the Ex-Im Bank provides and they\u2019re well below market. And they\u2019re competing against private marketplace, alternatives to capital and we believe there needs to be reform. And there is a place for the Bank in the marketplace when the bank was originally setup, back 60 or 70 years ago. It was to provide seed financing in developing nations. And now we\u2019re providing, at a time when we run huge deficits in the United States, we\u2019re taking the United States Treasury, the United States balance sheet and we\u2019re financing investment grade state-owned airlines at borrowing costs that are probably around 300 basis points less than what Delta would pay, and that\u2019s just not right for our government to do that. So there\u2019s a place for the bank, but the bank needs to be reformed and it needs to be transparent and it shouldn\u2019t be providing financing in any instance where there\u2019s a private market alternative. And our concerns are only limited to widebody airplanes. Not narrowbody airplanes or industrial equipment or the like. I will point out that both Valero Energy and Cleveland-Cliffs Steel have both also filed objections in their industries in instances where the Bank has financed their foreign competitors to compete against U.S. interests. In the end, it's about jobs, and I can tell you that when the Ex-Im does this, as in the case of Air India, it takes jobs away from the United States. Mary Schlangenstein \u2013 Bloomberg News : Do you feel like you're gaining any traction on your efforts to get the reforms that put into place? Richard H. Anderson: Yes, we are gaining traction. At the last ASU negotiation, we significantly increased the financing costs by a couple of hundred basis points. Second, in the last round of reauthorization, there were transparency requirements, which have been largely ignored, and there was a requirement that the United States, State Department and Treasury engage with EU authorities to negotiate an end to \u2013 both the EU and the U.S. run these huge, huge deficits. And the last thing they need to be doing is further funding those deficits by financing airplanes. Okay, Sherlon with that we have time for one more quick question. Operator : That comes from Ted Reed, The Street. Ted Reed \u2013 The Street : Thank you. My questions were largely asked, so I'd just like to ask, is it now fair to call Delta in terms of revenues the world's second largest airline due to revenue trends? Richard H. Anderson: We would rather tell operating margins. Ted Reed \u2013 The Street : Are you second largest there? Richard H. Anderson:  I think we are top of the game there. Ted Reed \u2013 The Street : All right, thank you. John E. Walker: Okay, hey great. Thanks, Jill, Richard, Ed, Paul and Glen, thanks very much for your time. That concludes our March quarter financial results. We'll be back here in three months with our June quarter financial results. Thanks very much. Bye-bye. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.",

My name is Sherlon and I will be your coordinator. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer-session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Sullivan Greer, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jill Sullivan Greer : Thanks Sherlon. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for our June quarter call. Speaking on the call today will be Richard Anderson, Delta's CEO; Ed Bastian, our President; and Paul Jacobson our Chief Financial Officer. Richard will open the call and then Ed will address our financial and revenue performance, and Paul will conclude with a review of cost performance and cash flow. We have the entire leadership team here with us in the room for the Q&A session. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. And you can find the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I will turn the call over to Richard Anderson. Richard Anderson : Thanks Jill, good morning. The June quarter results show Delta is a top performing S&P industrial company. We reported a 1.4 billion pre-tax profit an improvement of 70% year-on-year with 13.5% pre-tax margins. We grew 9% on the top-line with over 4 points of margin expansion and more than 1.5 billion of free cash flow. We grew unit revenues by 6% kept our non-fuel cost flat and used the refinery and hedges to lower our fuel prices despite an increase in market fuel prices. We earned $1.04 a share meeting consensus estimates of $1.03. Our adjusted net debt ended the quarter below 8 billion it\u2019s lowest level in 20 year. We have accelerated our shareholder returns paying out 550 million to our owners already this year. Our return on invested capital for the last 12 months was 18.2%. In the quarter we delivered exceptional operating reliability for our customers with a 99.9% completion factor including 27 days with zero main line cancellations and a 1 point year-on-year improvement in our on time rate to 83.4%. We saw an 11% improvement in our baggage performance. Our operational reliability combined with the top notch service delivered by our employees every day has produced a steady increase in our customer satisfaction levels and a 6% decrease in customer complaint. Delta runs the best overall airline in the industry by a significant margin, with the lowest capital cost per aircraft among our competitors. The credit for this record performance goes to the Delta team worldwide. I want to thank them for their efforts. It's an honor to serve them and to reward them with an additional $340 million accrued toward our profit sharing plan, along with $22 million in share reward payments this quarter. As part of our capital deployment announcement in May, we laid out a new set of long-term goals which raised the bar on our performance expectations for our owners. These annual goals, 11% to 14% op margin, 10% and to 15% EPS growth, 15 plus ROIC, 3 billion in free cash flow each year, and an investment grade quality balance sheet are aggressive but clearly achievable and we will continue to make meaningful progress year in and year out against these goals. As we look forward to the remainder of 2014 and beyond, Delta will continue to maintain the steady course we have been on, especially our disciplined approach to capacity levels. This discipline continues to be a key driver of our success as we will post record results for 2014. We see a good demand environment combined with modest capacity increases that will result in solid top line growth. More than 60% of our business is domestic in entity that is performing quite well and where we run a 13% RASM premium to the industry. We will see further margin benefits from our upgauging strategy. We are also improving international performance by making capacity adjustments to our network. In the trans-Atlantic, the industry has a very rational structure with 90% of the capacity within three immunized joint ventures. Delta's JVs represent about 30% of industry capacity in the trans-Atlantic and we manage this capacity at the JV level. The Delta JVs are very profitable as we operate those JVs as fully integrated businesses that is as if they were one airline. Over the past several years, Delta has taken the industry's most disciplined approach to capacity which has resulted in strong returns across the trans-Atlantic. We're going to remain disciplined with our capacity and keep both Delta and our combined JV trans-Atlantic capacity growth at 1% to 3% this winter season. In the Pacific, we are running a profitable operation and we'll further restructure our network by better aligning our Tokyo flying and building our U.S. gateway in Seattle. These efforts along with the benefits of smaller gauge white body replacement aircraft which began delivering in 2015 will drive better returns in the Pacific region. On the cost side, we made a commitment to you three years ago to keep our non-fuel cost growth below 2% annually by taking out over 1 billion in structural cost. Our results show these initiatives especially the domestic refleeting and maintenance cost management are delivering the projected benefits. Our non-fuel cost will be less than 1% this year. We also believe in actively managing fuel and we have invested in our fuel organization. Graeme Burnett has done a fine job running our fuel organization. This has allowed us to regularly produce quarter-after-quarter one of the lowest fuel prices in the industry. The refinery has made an impact on market fuel prices and we have a solid hedge book in place that should reduce our fuel expense by more than $350 million for the year including $100 million in the September quarter. Our fuel price this quarter of $2.93 per gallon compares quite favorably to the industry average fuel price excluding Delta of $3.08 per gallon. All of these factors combined should produce more top-line growth, margin expansion and operating cash flow improvements in the back half of the year. By maintaining capital discipline and keeping our CapEx at $2.3 billion this year, we should generate over $3 billion in free cash flow. We will use that free cash flow to further improve our balance sheet and return more cash to shareholders. We have already returned $550 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks this year including a $100 million so far in the month of July and we\u2019re on a path to return over $1 billion this year to our owners. Across the board, the business is performing extremely well but our goal is to make continued improvement. We have a solid plan in place and we are executing well against it. Our performance is setting a new standard and rivaling that of high quality industrial peers. We are one of only 80 companies in S&P 500 with free cash flow of $3 billion or more, and among S&P 500 industrial transports only UPS and Union Pacific have greater free cash flow. We have a lot of work ahead of us and also a lot of opportunity, we will post even better results in the third quarter with the forecast operating margin at 15% to 17%. I want to thank Jill and the IR team for tolerating our many edits to the materials for this call. And with that I\u2019ll turn it over to my colleague Ed Bastian. Ed Bastian : Thanks, Richard. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. For the June quarter, we reported a $1.4 billion pre-tax profit which is a $593 million improvement year-on-year. Our net income was $889 million or $1.04 per share. Our pre-tax margin was 13.5%. I also want to thank the Delta's people for just an outstanding quarter. Their efforts have resulted in a $439 million accruals of profit sharing so far this year that compares to 506 million for all of 2013, which at that time with the equivalents of 8.25% of employee pay just a great job by the entire team. Turning to the, excuse me the specifics for the quarter, we had a number of commercial successes including our corporate gains, merchandising initiatives, international partnerships and our investments in New York and Seattle. These initiatives were a key factor in driving our solid 9% top-line growth for the quarter. Our corporate revenues increased 8% year-on-year with largest gain in the financial services, media and banking sectors, all growing a double-digit rates, showing the momentum we are building in both New York as well as Los Angeles. In a recent survey, 85% of corporate travel managers expect to maintain or increase their future spend on Delta. Our passenger unit revenues increased nearly 6% on 3% higher capacity, approximately one point of this gain was attributable to the shift of Easter into the second quarter. The domestic entity was our best performer as unit revenues increased 7% with particular strength in the Atlanta and New York hubs. Our largest house Atlanta continues to outperform with double-digit gains on 2% higher capacity. New York's performance was supported by a strong spring break. In addition, our upgraded products and service on the New York trans-con help produce double-digit rise of gain in these markets on 12% higher capacity. Trans-Atlantic unit revenues in the quarter increased 7%, on a 2% reduction in capacity. The June quarter benefited from a strong shoulder period, partially as a result of the Easter shift. Within the trans-Atlantic, our Virgin joint venture helped drive our Heathrow unit revenues up 5% on 18% higher capacity. In addition, Virgin\u2019s June quarter profitability contributed $7 million in non-operating benefit from our equity stake. Our Latin unit revenues were flat, which was a solid performance considering the entity absorbed a 25% increase in capacity and experienced some demand weakness around the World Cup. We have been investing in our Latin network to leverage our equity investments in GOL and Aeromexico. The carriers both produced solid contributions to our revenues this quarter. GOL provided one-fourth of the traffic on our U.S. to Brazil flights and Aeromexico delivered nearly one-fourth of the traffic on our flight into key Mexican business cities. This traffic contributes $36 million in incremental revenues this quarter year-over-year. In the Pacific, our network restructuring helped offset the impact of the weakened Yen, resulting in a unit revenue decline of 3% on slightly higher capacity. Yen revenues declined by $10 million net of hedges. We remained well hedge on the Yen with more than 75% of our net Yen exposure hedged between 85% and 90% through 2015. These hedges are currently valued at over $113 million. Part of our Pacific restructuring is building out the Seattle Gateway, our Seattle international franchise is doing well. We had a 2% unit revenue improvement despite 30% capacity growth in a quarter where we launched new service to Seoul, Hong Kong and London. The domestic feed in Seattle also continued to performed well producing unit revenue improvement inline with our system averages. Our domestic unit revenues in Seattle grew 6%, while absorbing a 25% increase in capacity. We are also seeing good successes with our seat merchandising initiatives this is one of our fastest growing revenue streams increasing by $45 million over the last year. The success of our First Class Upsell initiative helped push paid first class load factors up more than 6 point to 45%. In terms of guidance, as we look into the fall, we see good forward bookings and all signs point to a continued solid demand environment. We are seeing particular strength in the domestic entity and expect the world cup driven weakness in Latin America to its swift side. However our Latin and RASM will be impacted by 3 points to 4 points due to our recent decision to pull down our flying into Venezuela as we work to repatriate over $190 million in revenues that are currently held in Bolivar. We know the capacity situation in the trans-Atlantic has been a concern for investors. This summer we are seeing trans-Atlantic industry capacity increase by 8% as carriers has shifted flying to capitalize in the regions recent outperformance. While our revenue generation this summer will be very strong, we expect our Q3 trans-Atlantic revenues to grow 5% to 6% on capacity growth of 3%. Our unit revenues are being somewhat impacted by industry oversupply. It's important to remember that we have profitable immunized joint ventures with both Air France-KLM, Alitalia as well as with Virgin Atlantic, which allow us to effectively manage this entity. As retrofit combined we manage over $13 billion of revenue and 30% of the industry's capacity. To continue improving our revenue and margin performance, we are leveraging those joint ventures to stay in discipline in our combined offerings. Together with our partners we are currently making adjustments to our joint capacity plans and expect our combined trans-Atlantic capacity to be up 1% to 3% for the upcoming winter season. As we approach the winter months, those adjustments will become more visible in public schedule. This level of capacity growth is inline with expected economic growth in the region and it will be accomplished through better utilization of existing Delta assets. So we believe we are well positioned on trans-Atlantic capacity and our advanced yields for the fall are ahead on a year-over-year basis to where we were at the same point going into this summer. We have flexibility in the business and we'll make additional changes to our joint capacity levels if necessary to continue on the path to achieving our financial goals. In the Pacific, we expect better performance in unit revenues as we passed the one year anniversary of the sharp move in the Yen and as our new international flight from Seattle mature. We're also making further changes to our Pacific network, realigning our flying in Tokyo's better matched demand and building more efficient connections with the remaining clients. Capacity from Tokyo to the beach markets is down 15% this summer and we have reduced our intra-Asia flying by 10%. Based on this overall environment, we are forecasting another quarter of solid top line growth and margin expansion. The comps do get tougher as we move through the year. In fact compared to Q2, our Q3 unit revenue comps are 300 basis points more difficult. We expect our September quarter RASM to improve 2% to 4% on 2% to 3% capacity growth. When combined with our cost outlook, that result should drive an operating margin of 15% to 17% or approximately 300 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year. With that I'll now hand the call over to Paul to cover cost and cash flow. Paul Jacobson : Thanks Ed, good morning everyone and thanks for your time this morning. A key focus for the organization has been our cost performance and our results this quarter are product of that focus across the board in non-fuel, fuel and non-operating expense. Total operating expenses for the quarter increased 3% with nearly all of that increase from higher profit sharing accruals. On a unit cost basis, we continue to meet our goal keep our growth below 2% while consistently investing in our employees, products and operations. Our ex-fuel CASM was flat for the quarter as the benefits of our domestic re-fleeting and other cost initiatives continued to take hold. On the fleet side, we put 22 new aircraft into service during the quarter which allowed us to retire older less efficient airplanes. This upgauging is producing meaningful operating leverage. For the June quarter, we produced 3% higher domestic capacity on almost 4% fewer departures. Going forward, our refleeting benefits will continue as we expect to retire an additional 47 aircraft in 2014 and another 80 to 90 in 2015. The refleeting is also the catalyst for a significant amount of maintenance savings, helping drive our maintenance expense down by more than $60 million for the quarter, as a result of more than 60 fewer airframe and engine events, primarily on regional jet. Not only have we avoided costly maintenance events on the aircraft that we\u2019re retiring, we\u2019re also able to harvest certain parts from retiring aircraft to reinvest in our active fleet at a lower cost. Beyond the refleeting, we have a solid stream of other cost initiatives that have already been implemented as we continue to find new opportunities to reduce expenses. We\u2019re staying disciplined with our headcount and overhead additions as we begin to modestly grow the airlines. We\u2019re also currently offering a voluntary retirement program to help in these efforts. We\u2019ve also been investing in technology that has improved the productivity of our front line employees. Investments in new systems for our reservations and airport agents are helping to create a better experience for our customers as well. Our supply chain team led by Chris Collette has successfully leveraged our scale to drive efficiencies from our vendors. These efforts should save north of $50 million this year. The success of these cost initiatives has allowed us to keep our unit cost growth well below 2% for each of the last four quarters, while building a foundation to be able to sustain this performance into the future. As a result, we expect our non-fuel CASM growth to remain below 2% for each of the September and December quarters. In addition to addressing our non-fuel costs, we are also actively managing fuel as Richard mentioned. Our fuel expense for the quarter decreased by $40 million even in the face of higher market prices and consumption were more than offset by improvements in the refinery\u2019s profitability and $98 million in hedge gain. Our fuel price was $2.93 per gallon, which includes the combined $0.11 of benefits from the hedges and the refinery. These results show the effectiveness of our investments in our strategy in meaningfully reducing our largest expense. The refinery made a $13 million profit for the quarter which was $64 million year-over-year improvement. Our domestic crude initiative has lowered cost of the plant with more than 40% of the refinery\u2019s inputs for the quarter from domestic sources compared to only 5% a year ago. We've announced an agreement earlier this week for 65,000 barrels per day of domestic crude for the refinery as well. By combining this transaction with our other sources of domestic crude, we expect to meet our full year goal of 70,000 barrels per day of domestic crude for all of 2014. This will provide additional benefit for the back half for the year and a good tailwind for 2015. For the September quarter, we are expecting to pay $2.88 to $2.93 per gallon for fuel including the impacts from the refinery and hedge. At current prices, our hedge book should deliver another $100 million in benefit and we expect the refinery to be roughly breakeven for the quarter. Turning to cash flow, the cash generation of Delta has obviously been a key driver of value for our shareholders. We generated over $2 billion of operating cash flow this quarter while our capital expenditures were $520 million, primarily for aircraft. This level of investment resulted in more than $1.5 billion of free cash flow for the quarter. As Richard mentioned, we will stay disciplined with our capital spending, prudently reinvesting in the business while also maintaining our CapEx in the $2 billion to $3 billion per year range. For 2014, we are on track to spend $2.3 billion including $600 million $700 million during the September quarter. And we continue to take a balanced approach to capital deployment. Debt reduction remains a priority for the company. Our adjusted net debt fell to $7.9 billion, more than 50% reduction since we began this program in 2009. Not only is this strengthening balance sheet and our foundation but it is also improving earning. In the last quarter alone, our interest expense declined by $40 million year-over-year. We are also using a portion of our cash flow to proactively address our pension liability. This quarter we contributed an additional $300 million to the pension plan, completing our contributions for the year at just over $900 million, in line with the plan we outlined in May. We moved aggressively to ramp up our shareholder capital returns also during the quarter, paying out $550 million to our owners since the start of the year. Thorough our dividend, we returned just over $100 million in the first half of the year. And as we announced in May, the dividend will increase 50% to $0.09 per share beginning this quarter. We have used share repurchases to accelerate the pace of our capital return. So far this year, we have repurchased 12.4 million shares at an average price of just over $36 per share for a total $450 million. These efforts completed our 2013 authorization and have already initiated the first $200 million of the new 2014 authorization. Let me conclude by thanking the Delta people for their dedication and determination in producing these outstanding results. We know we have more work ahead of us as we continue on the path of becoming that high quality industrial company but we have a key competitive and strategic advantage in each of the 80,000 people that are part of our team. There are no employees in the industry with a better track record of success. With that, I'll turn it back over to Jill. Jill Sullivan Greer : Thanks. Sherlon, that is going to conclude the prepared remarks and if we could move to the analysts Q&A and you could give them instructions on time to ask a question. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions). We'll have our first question from John Godyn, MSSB. John Godyn - MSSB: Hey, thank you for taking my question here. Paul you had a great list of cost initiative and the cost performance has just been tremendous. As we look out the next few years and we think about sustaining a sub-inflationary CASM ex-fuel growth rate. How does upgauging as an initiative rank among the initiatives and what inning are we in there, because it seems like the benefits are really dramatic? Paul Jacobson : Good morning John and thanks for your comments. It seems you\u2019ve been working really hard on that. Upgauging is obviously a critical element of that and we're still in a relatively early to middle innings of that program. We'll continue to be retiring CRJ's 50 theaters through the end of 2015 which will continue that program in the upgauging benefit through 2016. But we are also spending a lot of time and effort, investing in productivity initiatives and technology that help streamline the things that we do, recognizing that this is part of that foundation that we need to provide for the future. John Godyn - MSSB: Great. And Richard we've heard a lot of comments on [Axiom bank] and your point of view is clear just considering that you guys have an RFP out there, I wonder how much your position on the [Axiom bank] influences sort of your position on which manufacture to deal with? There are certainly market mechanisms for sending a message here. Richard Anderson : No, we are very objective evaluators of airplanes and we'll continue to be very objective evaluators of airplanes. We've done three RFPs over the last three to four years. Boeing did a very nice job on the 737-900 ER campaign with GE and then the last two campaigns we did which were smaller the A321 with the CFM56 prevailed. So it all comes down to economics and [Ned Peiper] and Paul Jacobson and the team do a phenomenal job. I think we get the best prices on airplanes in the world. And we're going to continue to be very opportunistic and be certain that we're buying proven technology that will give us the kind of returns on invested capital that our shareholders demand. John Godyn - MSSB: With the A330neo now formally announced is there any update on thoughts that you would be willing to share? Richard Anderson : Yes. If it's a priced in low 80s high 70s we might be a buyer. John Godyn - MSSB: Okay. All right thanks a lot guys. Operator : We'll go next to David Fintzen, Barclays. David Fintzen - Barclays: Hi good morning everyone. Question from Glen just thinking about the upguaging on the fleet size and John asked about the cost side but on the revenue side there doesn't look so far any evidence around in dilution. I am just curious since they are in the early to middle innings of (inaudible) have you start deploying more and more of the bigger airplanes where we start to see more of that dilution or is this kind of the restructure we should expect on RASM going forward. Glen Hauenstein : We've been very pleased with the RASM results given the fact that we are continuing to upgauge the airline and embedded within the result for the quarter was about seven-tenth of a point of what we call headwinds that would be structural based on the actual upguage of the airline and we\u2019ve been able to more than offset that by posting our unit revenue increase that was in excess of what the industry did. So I think it\u2019s the great products combined with the great people and the great services we\u2019re offering just creating a demand that\u2019s in excess of what we\u2019re offering in a marketplace and allowing us to continue that upgauge without seeing revenue deterioration. David Fintzen - Barclays: And that headwind, you think that headwind stays pretty constant through the program? Glen Hauenstein : Yes it does. David Fintzen - Barclays: Okay great. And then maybe just a quick one for Richard, you mentioned the JVs are in managed, JV is been managed as one business. Can you just give us some color around, obviously that JV is a part of your broader business and then your partner\u2019s broader business. I am saying it\u2019s specifically Air France. Does that create any tension in terms of how you want to set capacity in your JV when you\u2019re putting in the context of your broader business and as a tension there how do you manage those? Richard Anderson : Well we have add a trust community and these relationships go back decades. And Ed should probably give even more color, he is sort of more day-to-day than I am in all of these. Ed Bastian : Hi David. We particularly with Air France scale I mean I\u2019ll tell you our JV is predicated on a 50-50 sharing on capacity and there are some years that we maybe a little bit below or little bit above that benchmark but that\u2019s a key governor on the capacity decision. So of course there is always some tension as to which entity will do the flying and what the economic prospects are for the trans-Atlantic versus other opportunities elsewhere in the world. But I think we\u2019ve proven over the last number of years that we are the most disciplined JV out there and that we\u2019re also the most profitable JV out there and that success breathe a very good platform for future profitable returns particularly in the trans-Atlantic. The other thing I would add to that is these are highly integrated, we don't have all of the -- all our employees are basically AFKL employees in Europe and we run their operation here, they run yield management pricing in Europe at Amsterdam and we run for all the metal out of the U.S., I mean that can keep going down the list, but it really is single run. You got to think of it as running as a single airline. Even though there are a different colored, different painted to the airplanes in the JV. David Fintzen - Barclays: Okay. I appreciate all that color. Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Dan McKenzie, Buckingham Research. Dan McKenzie - Buckingham Research : Hey, good morning guys. You obviously get a nice job of taking Atlantic revenue worries off the table here. So Air France is profit warning obviously not a tied to the trans-Atlantic and demand out of the UK is obviously strong. I'm wondering if you can comparing contrast the corporate share gains out of London versus New York City driving that strength to London and also elsewhere in Europe. And then to what extend is foreign exchange a tailwind in the PRASM results here? Richard Anderson : Well, Dan on your first question with respect the corporate I think Glen maybe answer the FX question. Think about it, I'll answering but we can work on answer to that. Maybe he can answer and we will get back to you that. Dan McKenzie - Buckingham Research : Well, maybe somebody else in the room is going to answer. Richard Anderson : On the corporate volumes clearly Virgin has been a big assist with respect to our being able to get a stronger foothold into the lucrative JFK Heathrow marketplace particularly with the financial service providers and we continue to see very strong growth in New York. I think I mentioned on the call double digit RASM gains on top of a capacity growth that we have been implementing. With respect to Continental Europe obviously those are much more establish relationships and we are seeing good growth in Amsterdam and Paris on the corporate side as well and Rome for that matter. But it\u2019s not nearly at the level of growth and development as we are seeing in London. Dan McKenzie - Buckingham Research : Okay very good. And foreign exchange any perspective you can provide there? Richard Anderson : Yes. Come on Glen. Glen Hauenstein : Can we get back to you on that one? Dan McKenzie - Buckingham Research : Okay, thanks very much guys. Richard Anderson : Let me go ahead. I mean when you stop and think about how our JV works in the EU, the euro versus the dollar because of how the joint venture works we have a natural hedge because Air France-KLM, Alitalia are euro denominated. So unlike the Pacific where we do hedge the yen very profitably we don\u2019t the yen in euro because we have a natural hedge with our joint venture partners. Glen Hauenstein : Okay. And if I might add something about our transition of our trans-Atlantic over the last several years. I think this quarter is very important but when you look back it\u2019s even more important to see where we have come as an airline. If you think about Delta many years ago there was a big reason not to invest in Delta and the trans-Atlantic because London represents 35% of all the business traffic from the U.S. to Europe and we had no access to it through open skies, but then through the creativity of the management team to go ahead and create a joint venture with Virgin we have the number two position in the U.S. and the UK. And we've made incredible gains on that. And really we think there is a great opportunity for us to continue to build with Virgin as we move forward, using the best of both brands. So if you take our network to Europe what it was several years ago, primarily U.S. to points in Europe that really didn't have a lot of business traffic. And you look at the concentration of our network today heavily centered on a big business centers in Europe. Richard Anderson : And one other point Dan on the FX, these are two areas, I don't think Europe was a big mover for us in the quarter. But the two areas of FX where we did see big impacts one is Japan obviously and we already commented about the RASM decline, we are seeing in the Pacific driven by the yen's weakness, while we do have a good hedge it is still not a 100% effective. And the other one is Venezuela, where we're taking capacity steps to reduce our exposure to Venezuela given the inability to access the bolivars in the country. And those capacity steps will result in about a 3 point hit to a LatAm RASMS in the third quarter. Dan McKenzie - Buckingham Research : Very good. Thanks guys. Operator : We'll go next to Jamie Baker, JPMorgan. Jamie Baker - JPMorgan: Hey, good morning everybody. The first question for Paul 2014 is shaping up to be one of the worst years in terms of worldwide commercial hull losses, I think in over a decade now. And I actually haven't given much thought to insurance premiums since it spiked after 9/11, it is not a line item that we actually modeled. But can you remind us what sort of flexibility your insurers might have to upwardly adjust rates after a year of potentially billions in claims. I'm just trying to assess whether this is a conversation we even need that and feel free to comment if you think the question is irrelevant, it won't hurt my feelings. Paul Jacobson : Well, good morning Jamie. I would never deliberately, unintentionally even try to hurt your feelings, but\u2026. Jamie Baker - JPMorgan: (Inaudible). Paul Jacobson : The changes in the insurance market that we anticipate over the next year are probably not material to the overall performance of the company but a couple of things I think worth noting. One, we're actually getting sizeable year-over-year improvements in our insurance premium as we reshape our portfolio with a lower risk balance sheet and the entity that we\u2019ve created being able to take on a little bit more retentions and using that leverage in the marketplace. Secondly, we also during the quarter opted out of the FA war risk program and it went back into the commercial programs and have realized significant savings on a year-over-year basis. So while the market might be challenged during the renewal periods, I think some of the structures and some of the initiatives that we've taken will help to mitigate that but either way, we don't think it will be material. Jamie Baker - JPMorgan: Excellent, I appreciate that. And for Richard and forgive me, this is a bit of replay from last quarter. If you consider the next pilot contract, it still isn\u2019t clear to me what management\u2019s ask is going to be unlike last time, you don't need additional scope relief, I don't think. You don't need a 717 rate and so forth. So my concern is that Delta may have the upper hand this time around at the negotiation table which could put pressure on the longer term ex-fuel CASM targets that you were speaking about earlier, any thoughts on this? Richard Anderson : We have an incredible track record working with our colleagues at ALPA. And if you just look at the track record over the last 10 years, it\u2019s been just phenomenal. And we expect it to continue to be that way. So if you look at what we\u2019ve been doing in the business we\u2019ve really taken the labor risk totally off the table at Delta. And our employees are fully engaged in they are delivering a great product. And that's one of the key de-risking events that we've undertaken at Delta that\u2019s unique to the company. And we\u2019re not -- it\u2019s one of the most valuable things we have and that relationship is very important to us. And we will continue unabated on the track that we\u2019ve been on for a decade. Jamie Baker - JPMorgan: As a follow-up to that and the hypothetically, if your primary competitors were able to reach the same level of operational integrity along the lines of what you were discussing earlier but without as [generous] profit sharing mechanism, would you ever revisit that structure? Richard Anderson : We\u2019re not going to get into, Jamie, the details of how those conversations go. Those are internal conversations. I would only note that the last time around with our pilots, Ed, what we\u2026 Ed Bastian : We did restructure the profit sharing arrangement two years ago. And I think as we look forward to that, we\u2019ve got a number of things that we can work with to help fund some of the heightened expectations but we\u2019re not, as Richard said, we\u2019re not going to share those details on the call. Jamie Baker - JPMorgan: Got it. I appreciate it. Thank you very much for both answers. Gentlemen, I appreciate it. Take care. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to the Duane Pfennigwerth, Evercore. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore: Hey, good morning. Thanks. Just on June, I wonder if you comment on how much of the variance in the month was due to the World Cup, was it Brazil specifically versus the region broadly and most importantly, are you seeing any improvement in bookings there yet? Ed Bastian : It impacted the entire sector; if you look at the recent A4A data for the month of June that came out, Latin unit revenues were down considerably I think it fell 5% Duane if I am not mistaken for the entire sector. So, it was part of the softness near the end of June. We\u2019re pleased to say though that we do see the demand starting pick back up again. And we have a pretty good outlook relative to the fall for heading into particularly in some of the Central and South American countries. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore: I appreciate that color. And then just a broader industry question about pricing. When you think about where fares can go versus think like U.S. to see demand, where do you think we are in terms of industry fare levels and what region do you think offers the most upside? Thanks for taking the questions. Ed Bastian : We like to stay completely off of future pricing discussions on these earnings calls. So we're going to differ answering that question. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore: How about if I could, is there a reference point or a metric relative to GDP or relative to I guess travel spend as a bucket more broadly that reinforces the case that airline pricing generally is too low? Ed Bastian : Once again, in the legal business we have something called, a term called asked and answered. And I think it\u2019s been asked and answered. And this would be better off that we not discuss that. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore: Okay, fair enough. Thanks for taking. Operator : We'll go next to Joe DeNardi, Stifel. Joe DeNardi - Stifel: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Richard, I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about given the positive roll that your JVs and partnerships are having on the Atlantic side and down the Latin America. I mean are there opportunities for that on the Pacific side? It just seems like kind of getting that capacity situation under control, is going to be a little bit tougher than only Atlantic? Richard Anderson : Yes. We do have opportunities in the Pacific. I think we\u2019ve some great experience that we can attain and take from both the trans-Atlantic as well as what we are doing in Mexico and Brazil and apply to some of our Pacific relationships. Clearly Korea is one that we have had a challenge over the last several years in developing a JV construct and some improved revenue and commercial sharing initiatives. I am cautiously optimistic that we can make some progress as we look forward to the next couple of years with Korean and then in addition beyond that much longer-term is China. Joe DeNardi - Stifel: Okay. And then with Virgin Atlantic, can you just update us on how that\u2019s tracking relative to your expectations and should we expect the contribution there to accelerate going forward as they start to get some of these 787s later this year? Richard Anderson : Yes, you should expect to see the profitability of Virgin Atlantic improve. For 2014 current year, they are expect to post a small profit but don\u2019t forget two years ago when we acquired our 49% stake, they were losing -- it was well over $100 million a year at that point in time. So they have done a nice job of cutting the losses and starting to build some profitability and margin improvement. As we look to the next two years, the fleet changes are making with the 787s are going to help but also the relationship with Delta and our ability to drive increased levels of U.S. share into London and throughout the UK is also going to help them a lot. Joe DeNardi - Stifel: Okay. And then maybe a quick one for Paul on trainer, just kind of what the expectations are for CapEx. And then what I saw on, Richard, on CNBC mentioning purchasing a tanker, I mean what\u2019s the plan there, is that like the first of others or maybe I miss read I think? Paul Jacobson : Good morning, Joe. We leased the tanker over the quarter that is going to help to increase our ability to source domestic crude for the refinery. And I think CapEx is generally inline with what we talked about when we acquired the plant at $50 million to $100 million a year in terms of annual CapEx upkeep et cetera. But I think when you look at the overall sourcing strategy, it's imperative that we get increasing access to domestic crude especially in declining crack spread environments, which by the way is the ideal scenario for us as a large consumer of jet fuel. Ed Bastian : And just on that point, where you can get, we can get domestic crude delivered to the refinery at $2 to $3 a barrel below So, it generates a lot of opportunity. Joe DeNardi - Stifel: Okay. Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Darryl Genovesi, UBS. Darryl Genovesi - UBS: Hi, good morning guys. So just on, just wondering about your PRASM trajectory from here, I guess how do you think about your ability to maintain unit revenue growth inline with the industry, when you are already operating from a premium position? How long do you think this can go on and is the biggest driver that you still have really in developmental markets out of New York and LA and Seattle, kind of improving from here? Richard Anderson : We, it's tough to give a longer term outlook on industry revenues and RASM, all I know is that at Delta we have a conservable pipeline of initiatives for improvement that we have been investing in, and customers really appreciate first and foremost the quality of the service and reliability of the product that our employees deliver. We've got great opportunities as we look to London particularly and the Virgin relationship will take easily another couple of years to ramp up to expectations and we're making great progress there. And I also think down in Latin America with both Aeromexico and GOL in Brazil, those are very young relationships, that still have a lot of growth opportunity. We're very well positioned in the high growth markets of the world when you think about where we sit both in Asia as well as in Brazil and Mexico and certainly one that which is the cornerstone of U.S. travel to London. So I think the product and service offerings are going to drive the determination on the customer side of where the industry revenues goal and I feel very good about our performance at Delta to continue to deliver on their expectations. Darryl Genovesi - UBS: Okay. And then I guess on the cost side you've been coming through kind of at the favorable end of your CASM guidance for the last couple of quarters. Is there anything in particular that makes the second half harder other than perhaps more difficult comps in the second half of 2013 I guess any kind of discrete cost items that, that booked out the first half and into the second half I guess just any comment around the kind of second half versus the first half would be helpful? Ed Bastian : Yes, sure Darryl, I think you touched on it this is now our fourth consecutive quarter of non-fuel CASM less than 2% so the comps are getting a little bit more difficult, but at the same time we're accumulating more benefits from the updating. So I think we'll continue to have that momentum as we lap that cost performance, but there isn't really anything extraordinary or special I think it's just continuing down the initiative path. Darryl Genovesi - UBS: Great thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Mike Linenberg, Deutsche Bank. Mike Linenberg - Deutsche Bank : Hey, good morning two questions here. Ed if I could just go back to you mentioned that joint venture capacity for the winter would be up 1% to 3%, what was it previously and when you say winter is that fourth quarter is that a combination of the fourth quarter and the March quarter of 2015? Ed Bastian : It\u2019s the winter I added so essentially November through March, covering basically the fourth and the first quarters. What it was previously it was probably twice of that. Mike Linenberg - Deutsche Bank : Okay. Richard Anderson : And certainly its pointed in the published schedules. Mike Linenberg - Deutsche Bank : Great, I appreciate that answer. Then my next question this is to Richard, Richard you\u2019ve seen the pilots come out, I guess this is really around what\u2019s going on with Norwegian and their subsidiary carrier. They\u2019re talking about maybe rethinking Open Skies Agreement. And then I believe last week the Chairman of Air France came out and even talked about potentially renouncing some of these more liberal agreements these Open Skies agreements. What are your thoughts on that? And do you or you view that maybe our negotiators were outsmarted by some of these smaller countries? Richard Anderson : Well, I think it\u2019s a first line principal we support Open Skies as a general principal. And overall just like any trade agreement Open Trade Agreements are a good idea. But then there is going to be a subset of just like in steel or beef or any other industry there is going to be a subset of bilaterals that need equity. In other words, the challenge that we have in some of these instances as an industry is that yes, our negotiators have not done a very good job in the United States. And what we need to be able to do is on a bilateral basis one agreement at a time, make sure that there is parity and equity between the parties, particularly where you have we don\u2019t compete against airlines, we compete against governments. So when Delta is competing against a government, we need to make sure that there is equity in that relationship as part of an Open Skies agreement. Mike Linenberg - Deutsche Bank : Great. Thanks Richard. Jill Sullivan Greer : Sherlon, we're going to have time for one more question from the analyst. Operator : That will come from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi Syth - Raymond James : Hey, good morning. Just a quick question on Trainer. I am a little surprised that the expectation for Trainer is to be breakeven in the third quarter given it's like profit here and the second and maybe more Bakken or domestic crudes being used? Richard Anderson : Hi, good morning Savi. Thanks for the question. A lot of that has to do with the crack spreads environment particularly been hit hard this year been distillates crack which is actually the great thing for Delta, because we're exposed to 95 million barrels a year on distillates crack that the airline. So when crack spreads decline and we see that performance at a breakeven level particularly with relatively strong gas cracks from time-to-time then we're actually pretty happy from that result. The important thing for our strategy is to continue to lower the overall input costs for the plant through domestic crudes. So that we can help to create that cushion in a low distillate crack environment where we can make a little bit money at the refinery while also enjoying the full benefits lower crack spreads at the airline. Savi Syth - Raymond James : Okay, that makes sense. And then just a quick follow-up on the comment that you as made on the Latin route here. A lot of the growth internationally is focused on LAN-TAM and this seems like your unit revenues is stronger than industry in general. Is that as a result of the joint ventures, is it just kind of where you are focused on. I'm just kind of curious a bit just because a lot of growth is coming there. I guess I worry about if there is softness there what happens? Ed Bastian : Yes Savi, this is Ed clearly the relationships with Aeromexico and GOL are driving a very nice assistant support to our Latin franchise but we are seeing improvements across many parts of that sector and I expect it\u2019s going to continue. Savi Syth - Raymond James : Understood, okay thanks so much. Jill Sullivan Greer : And that\u2019s going conclude the analyst portion of the call I am now going to turn the call over to our new Chief Communications Officer, Kevin Shinkle for the news portion. Kevin Shinkle : Thanks Jill. We would like to open up the call to questions from reporters, please review the steps for asking a question. And we would like to ask if you limit your questions to one with a quick follow up. With that we wish accommodate most everyone. Thanks so I turn it over to Sherlon. Operator : (Operator Instructions). We\u2019ll have our first question from Susan Carey, Wall Street Journal. Susan Carey- Wall Street Journal : I understand Richard earlier on CNBC that you are not planning to supply to Israel today did any of your airplanes need to be ferried out of Tel Aviv yesterday or today because of the NO TAM. Gil West : No there wasn\u2019t. This is Gil West by the way as you saw we were a couple hours outside of Tel Aviv and there was a missile reportedly hit about a mile from the airport. So we diverted proactively and we did not have any aircraft on the ground. Susan Carey- Wall Street Journal : And Gil do you expect I mean the FAA is promising that they are going to give us some further word on the status of Tel Aviv flights in about an hour or two. I mean what's your, are you guys ready to resume on Thursday, if they indeed do lift the ban today? Gil West : Well, what I would say is we're in constant communication with the FAA at all levels within the company to assist the situation. And obviously, safety of our customers and employees are first. As the situation changes we're certainly reevaluating that. Richard Anderson : And Susan, this is Richard. We make those decisions independent of the FAA, we make the decisions that Gil made yesterday was well before we heard anything from the FAA, because a Hamas missile lands a mile from the airport on the north side where we approach on final in a 747. So, we're going to make those decisions wholly independent. We appreciate the advising concern and the intelligence we get. But we have a duty and an obligation above and beyond that to independently make the right decision to our employees and passengers. Susan Carey- Wall Street Journal : But if they say we are keeping the ban in place, obviously you are going to respect that? Richard Anderson : Absolutely, because it's a NO TAM it's a notice to airlines. Susan Carey- Wall Street Journal : Right. Richard Anderson : And we would absolutely respect that. But even if they lift the NO TAM we still may not go in depending upon what the facts and circumstances are. Susan Carey- Wall Street Journal : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to David Koenig, The Associated Press. David Koenig - The Associated Press : Yes, I guess this is on everybody's mind, just a follow up on the standards, I know what you said there. Could you say anything more about in addition to FAA listing it's a NO TAM, what do you need to see before you can resume Tel Aviv service, what do you need to see on the ground there? Richard Anderson : Well, I mean a lot of this is information that is not public between Delta and the government. So I don't want to speculate on that publicly and I want to respect our information sources and the cooperation we have with DHS and FAA. But the bottom line is, we need to make sure that we're discharging our safety obligations to our customers and employees and we make those decisions here at Delta all the time on an independent basis. So, we'll evaluate the information we have and we'll make the judgment that our passengers and employees are allowing us to make for them every day. David Koenig - The Associated Press : Okay, may be what I was getting at was whether you needed to see a ceasefire. More broadly, are you insisting or would you like to see some change in the way that international risk assessment is handled for airlines? Richard Anderson : No, we do our -- we have an obligation to make our own risk assessments under our SMS program and we have a broad and deep security network around the world. We have security directors that work for Delta in all the regions of the world. And we have a very sophisticated capability and methodology to manage these kinds of risks whether it is this or volcano or hurricane that's what we do well. David Koenig - The Associated Press : All right. Thank you very much. Operator : We'll go next to Mike Sasso, Bloomberg News. Mike Sasso - Bloomberg News : Hi, thanks for taking my call. Just a quick update, I think any updates on the RFP for the 50 white bodies and if you could just re-clarify what you said about the A330 NEOs please? Richard Anderson : The most clarifying point I could make is we like very low prices. Operator : We\u2019ll move to Kelly Yamanouchi, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Kelly Yamanouchi - The Atlanta Journal-Constitution: Hi there. I just wanted to ask about what you think is driving Atlanta\u2019s outperformance in the most recent quarter double-digit gains in unit revenue with the competitive landscape or strength in particular corporate travel sectors. Glen Hauenstein : Kelly, hi. It\u2019s Glen. How are you? Kelly Yamanouchi - The Atlanta Journal-Constitution: Good. How are you? Glen Hauenstein : Good, thank you. I think it\u2019s a combination of bunch of factors. And one of them clearly is that we\u2019re running such a great airline here in Atlanta with the leading (inaudible) performance, with baggage performance and customers are choosing us and they\u2019re choosing us where the competitor set that\u2019s existed in Atlanta for the last 30 or 40 years. So we\u2019re really, really pleased with our share numbers, our share business traffic. But Atlanta is also starting to grow and that\u2019s a good thing for Delta. And so seeing when our economy turnaround and seeing the job creation that\u2019s occurring here, it\u2019s really benefiting us as well. So it\u2019s a combination of higher share of the premium traffic out of Atlanta and a combination of Atlanta starting to grow again. And that\u2019s great news for Delta and great news for everybody who lives here. Kelly Yamanouchi - The Atlanta Journal-Constitution: Great. And I was also wondering if there is any idea, this might be a question for Richard or Ed, how many people you all expect to take the early retirement offer if is there is any goal? Mike Campbell : Kelly, this is Mike Campbell. The program is still open. We have another week to run and it just could be in the 800 to 900 range that we\u2019re forecasting, maybe a little higher. Kelly Yamanouchi - The Atlanta Journal-Constitution: Okay, great. Thank you so much. Operator : We'll go next to Karen Jacobs with Reuters. Karen Jacobs - Reuters: Hello. My question I want to get back to the salaries. The comments earlier were useful because it did seem that Delta was upfront yesterday in sustaining flights. My question is do you think the regulatory agencies worldwide that deal of the airlines guidance. Do you think that they are responding with that guidance now to be help with airline, particularly in chances where fighting and (inaudible) make flying in certain aerospace root structures? Richard Anderson : We have good cooperation with governments around the world and good cooperation with our government sector jobs in the homeland security, Mike reported at the FAA. All the agencies here in Atlanta. They are very helpful and they work very hard to make the right decision. Karen Jacobs - Reuters: Thank you. Unidentified Company Representative : Thanks. Sherlon with that we will have time for one more quick question. Operator : That will come from Susan Carey, The Wall Street Journal. Susan Carey - Wall Street Journal : Hi, sorry to come back here. But Richard also said earlier today that Delta has not fly zones over Iran, Iraq, Syria, Ukraine, Afghanistan and North Korea. I understand though from your own company that as recently is like earlier this week your Atlantic-Dubai flight would depending on the whether fly over Iraq and Syria. And then your Amsterdam-Mumbai flight had been regularly flying over Ukraine. So is this kind of like you adapt your roots depending on your judgment and your government sourcing. Richard Anderson : Yes. We have a very dynamic process 24/7 security desk and we are always taking information from various sources and conservatively planning the airline and we make those kinds of changes regularly in our operation center just like we got up yesterday morning you will make the decision to turn (inaudible) fly it around because of the Hamas Rocket. Susan Carey - Wall Street Journal : Okay, great. Thank you. Unidentified Company Representative : Okay, thanks to everyone on the phone. Richard, Ed, Paul, Glen, Gil, Mike, [Kevin], thanks very much for your time that concludes our June quarter financial results. Thank you and good bye. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.",

My name is Kellian, I will be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer-session following today\u2019s presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Ms. Jill Sullivan Greer, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Jill. Jill Sullivan Greer : Thanks, Kellian. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for our September quarter call. Speaking on the call today will be Richard Anderson, Delta's CEO; Ed Bastian, our President; and Paul Jacobson our Chief Financial Officer. Richard will open the call and then Ed will address our financial and revenue performance, and Paul will conclude with a review of cost performance and cash flow. We have the entire leadership team here with us in the room for the Q&A session. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted, you can find the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at delta.com. And with that, I will turn the call over to Richard. Richard Anderson : Thank, Jill, good morning. Before we start, I want to introduce Joanne Smith, our new Chief Human Resource Officer. Joanne has served as a Delta leader for 12 years at various senior leadership capacities in marketing and in-flight service. She has great respect for Delta\u2019s culture, values and our employees, and we\u2019re quite pleased for her to take on this new role. I want to thank Mike Campbell for his leadership and valuable contributions to Delta. We wish him the best in retirement although he will continue to advise us through a long-term consulting agreement. This morning we reported a very good quarter with a $1.6 billion pre-tax profit for the September quarter, which is an increase of 35% or 431 million improvement year-on-year. We grew out top-line revenues by 7%, held non-fuel costs flat for the third consecutive quarter, and generated a 15.8% operating margin which is a 2.6 point improvement year-on-year. Our ROIC for the last 12 months was 19.3%. Our strong cash generation continued with 1.3 billion of operating cash flow and over 9 million of free cash flow for the quarter. Year-to-date, we have generated 4.3 billion of operating cash flow and 2.8 billion of free cash flow, which has allowed us to fund 900 million to our pension plans, reduce 2 billion of net debt, and return more than 775 million to shareholders in dividends and share buybacks. We continue to run by a very wide margin the industry\u2019s best operations. In the September quarter, we delivered a 99.7% completion factor including 15 days with zero mainline cancellations. Our on-time rate improved 2.5 points to 85.6 and our customer satisfaction scores are climbing as our customer complains decreased by 3% as we consistently ranked number two fewest DOT customer complains. These operational results are a testament to how hard our employees are working across the system to raise the bar for our customers. We thank them for our service and we know that we have huge improvement opportunities ahead in our operation. We showed our appreciation for our employees\u2019 performance on October 3rd when we paid out an advance of 305 million on our 2014 profit sharing equal to 5% of our employees\u2019 pay, which is an addition to the 24 million in shared rewards payments this quarter. We know that Delta\u2019s positive employee culture differentiates us from our competitors and we reward our employees with pay for performance through our profit sharing program and shared rewards. This alignment reduces risk and when employees have a vested interest in the future profitability of the company, they take great care of our customers, they take great care of each other. This drives revenue growth and better returns for our owners. Six months ago, we raised the bar on our long-term financial goals and we attempt to continue to improve on our financial and operating results. This quarter shows our steady execution even in the midst of a choppy global economy. We also know we have more work and more opportunity ahead of us to reduce the level of risk in our business and continue to deploy our cash flow for our owners. This will strengthen our foundation and drive greater sustainability in our results regardless of the global environment. There are three key areas that we\u2019ll de-risk going forward in our business. The first is the continuation of our capacity discipline. As margins continue to improve, a conservative level of growth is appropriate and we\u2019ll drive higher profits, expanded returns, and improved cash flows for our shareholders. We plan to keep our system capacity fairly disciplined at about the rate of growth of GDP. Through steep density increases and up gauging, we can generate modest capacity increases on a smaller fleet count. Since 2009 we have reduced our fleet by 200 airplanes, while we\u2019re still finalizing next year\u2019s plan and will have the details that our Investor Day in December, we\u2019re targeting overall 2015 system capacity growth at approximately 2%. In the trans-Atlantic this summer the industry was pressured by excess capacity growth. Despite the capacity situation, our trans-Atlantic profitability increased year-over-year and again we produced really good double-digit margins with a very significant low factor premium to the industry. The industry capacity picture has changed significantly in the trans-Atlantic from where it stood three months ago. Together with our JV partners we have adjusted our course and we\u2019ll limit JV capacity growth to around 1% to 3% this winter, a level that is appropriate within the current demand environment. This capacity reduction in the trans-Atlantic has freed up smaller gauge right by the aircraft that we can now redeploy to the Pacific allowing us to accelerate plans to retire our entire fleet of 16 747-400s. We\u2019ve already retired three in September and another one this quarter. Four more will be retired in 2015 and the remainder will exit the fleet by 2017. These retirements will be margin accretive and are expected to generate $100 million next year in operating contribution. The second aspect of risk reduction is diversifying our revenue base by widening our global footprint, building immunized joint ventures internationally with our equity investments and expanding our ancillary and merchandizing offerings. These types of changes are building a more stable revenue base and reducing business risk. In just the September quarter, we saw more than 20% revenue growth from some of our ancillary product initiatives. The final aspect is continuing to reduce financial risk. We are going to keep paying down debt. High quality industrial companies have investment grade balance sheets and their low interest expense allows them to consistently produce profits even in cyclical industries. With our recent S&P upgrade, we are two notches away from investment grade. We have reduced our debt levels by nearly $10 billion over the last five years, which is saving us more than $0.5 billion per year in interest expense compared to 2009. We are on-track to reduce our debt level below 7 billion at year-end and all the way down to 5 billion by 2016. We will continue to see the benefit to our earnings as our interest expense declines. Deploying our capital in a balanced manner is essential for our long-term success. To this end we will invest approximately 50% of our operating cash flow back into the business, keeping our capital expenditures in the 2 billion to 3 billion range. Through a combination of new and used aircraft purchases and right now given the huge glut of airplanes in the global market, we\u2019ll have great opportunities for used aircraft purchases in the future. We are very disciplined in all of our capital spending and we have a path to keep our capital expenditures easily within these ranges while keeping our fleet vibrant. With roughly 3 billion in free cash flow each year, we will continue to pay down debt, address our pension obligations and return more cash to our shareholders. As our net debt goes down and our free cash flow improves, our Board is quite focused on meeting ROIC goals, while continuously improving our shareholder capital returns. We have shown our commitment to return capital to our owners. In our initial capital deployment plan announced less than 18 months ago, we envisioned returning approximately $350 million per year. We will return more than 1 billion this year and have already completed more than 15% of our $2 billion share repurchase authorization in the first four months. We will update our share repurchase progress at our December Investor Day. To reiterate we\u2019re on a long-term path to consistently deliver top-quality results and to be the best in the global airline industry. In closing while we are consistently producing record profitability we know there is more work ahead. For the fourth quarter, we expect 10% to 12% operating margins and a full year pre-tax profit comfortably above 4 billion. We have the right foundation in place, a clear direction where we want to take this company over the long-term and 80,000 Delta employees who are the very best in the industry. With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ed. Ed Bastian : Thanks Richard. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today. With the September quarter we reported a $1.64 billion pre-tax profit, which was a $431 million improvement year-over-year. Our net income was a $1 billion or $1.20 per share. Our results this quarter would not have been possible without the contributions made by the entire Delta team. I am pleased to say that we have set aside $384 million in profit sharing for the results this quarter, bringing us to a total of $823 million accrued so far this year. And we expect to payout a $1 billion total for 2014, our highest profit sharing ever representing about 15% of pay. Turning to the specifics for the quarter, we grew our top-lines by 7% on a 3% increase in capacity. Our corporate revenues increased 6% compared to last year with continuing double-digit gains from the financial services and automotive sectors and high single-digit gains in the banking and media sectors. Our merchandizing and ancillary initiatives continue to exceed expectations and generated $290 million of revenues for the quarter with more than 20% revenue growth in the paid first-class upsell and Economy Comfort products. Our first-class upsell initiative helped push paid first-class load factors up more than 6 points to 44%. Looking at unit revenues, our passenger RASM increased 2.4% with yields up 1.9%. The domestic entity was our top performer with 5% unit revenue improvements on 2% higher capacity. We continue to see solid results in New York. LaGuardia\u2019s performance outpaced the domestic entity with 10% unit revenue growth and the Transcon saw RASM gains despite 20% capacity growth. Our Atlantic domestic unit revenues were up 8% driven by near double-digit yield improvements in both the local business and leisure segments. Seattle\u2019s domestic performance has significantly exceeded our expectations as unit revenues increased 6% on a 25% increase in capacity driving margin improvements year-over-year. Our decision to shift capacity out of Cincinnati and Memphis to build out the Seattle Hub is producing solid results. In the trans-Atlantic our unit revenues were flat with a 4% increase in capacity despite 1.5 points of RASM pressure from the events affecting Moscow, Tel Aviv and West Africa. Our joint venture with Virgin Atlantic is doing well with a 4% RASM gain and a 17% increase in profitability on a combined 7% increase in capacity. Turning to the Pacific, the yen weakness contributed to unit revenue underperformance as unit revenues were down 2% on flat capacity. Yen revenues declined $20 million net of hedges. We are addressing this performance with our Pacific restructuring. And finally in the Latin entity our unit revenues were down 5% on more than 15% higher capacity as we continue to invest in this part of our network. While we have relatively small exposure to Venezuela and Argentina those two markets accounted for half of the unit revenue decline in the Latin entity. In addition, the entity faced headwinds from the World Cup this summer especially in Brazil. We are now seeing good recovery in this demand. AeroMexico contributed more than 20% of the traffic into our key Mexican markets. And GOL contributed nearly 30% of the traffic from the U.S. to Brazil. Combined, this traffic generated $40 million of incremental revenues for the quarter. Our investments in these two carriers are proving to be beneficial. Now looking ahead to the December quarter, the overall revenue environment remains solid. And we expect to produce a 0% to 2% unit revenue gain which combined with a significant decline in fuel prices will lead to continued margin expansion. There will be some noise between the individual months due to the timing of the ThanksGiving holiday with the Sunday ThanksGiving return traffic which is our largest revenue day of the year shifting back into November this year. For the quarter, we expect approximately 3% capacity growth. This top-line revenue of about 5%, combined with lower fuel prices and other cost productivity, will help drive an estimated 10% to 12% operating margin for the quarter, which is a 200 to 300 basis point margin expansion and also represents a 300 to 400 basis point pre-tax margin expansion. We\u2019re obviously most levered to the domestic system with more than 60% of our revenue generated in that entity. And domestic continues to perform well. Our ThanksGiving and advanced unit revenues are up about 8% and the Christmas New Year\u2019s bookings look solid. The biggest driver of our domestic profitability improvement over the last two years has been our upgauging initiative which continues to drive higher unit revenues, lower unit cost and expanded domestic margins. We still have considerable opportunity ahead in this area as we reguage the domestic airline. Probably the biggest sorts of questions we currently get from investors is how we\u2019re managing the international entities in the current environment. Optimizing the international network is one of the best opportunities we have to continuing to improve margins and returns. Capacity discipline is especially important to this effort. And to this end, our plan is to keep our international capacity growth relatively flat next year. In the trans-Atlantic, capacity levels have been recalibrated to the current demand environment working with our JV partners we lowered our growth plans to 1% to 3% for the winter with a similar level of growth plan for 2015. While our overall trans-Atlantic capacity will modestly grow, we have very different approaches to capacity within the entity. Our primary growth area is London. The Delta Virgin Atlantic combined capacity into London is expected to increase 2.6% in the winter as growing demand is supported by our new joint venture. London-Heathrow continues to be a bright spot as we have seen our JV margins expand 270 basis points year-to-date. For the remainder of Europe, we expect our capacity to increase just over 1 point with our major focus continuing on optimizing capacity between Delta\u2019s U.S. hubs and the Paris and Amsterdam hubs of Air France-KLM. Offsetting this growth however, our capacity reductions in the areas that continue to have demand volatility, Moscow, Tel Aviv, and West Africa. Through a combination of down-gauging, reducing frequencies and cancelling service to Liberia, we have reduced our capacity by 20% in these effected markets, which is in line with current demand trends. And to put into context, these markets represent approximately 1% of our overall system-wide capacity. Looking at our Latin network, we\u2019re now entering the later stages of our investment with double-digit capacity growth in the December and March quarters followed by low single-digit capacity changes from that point forward. This density is absorbing our capacity investment quite well excluding Venezuela we\u2019re on-track to produce unit revenue gains in the December quarter on 15% capacity growth. We expect Latin\u2019s performance to further improve in 2015 as we annualize our capacity adds and our relationship with AeroMexico and GOL mature. By far the greatest potential that we had is with our Pacific restructuring. While there is still a lot of work to be done in the region it continues to be pressured by a weakening yen, we have an aggressive strategy to improve our margins and returns and we have a three-pronged approach to restructuring the Pacific. First, we\u2019re adjusting our capacity levels. Our Pacific capacity will decline in the high single-digits next year with a 25% to 30% reduction in our low yielding intra-Asia flying. Second, we\u2019re getting the gauge rate regarding our aircraft in the market. We\u2019ve retired the first 4747s this year with the remainder set to exit the fleet over the next two to three years. This year we\u2019re backfilling a portion of this capacity with smaller gauged aircraft moved from the trans-Atlantic and as we take delivery of new Airbus 330s next year, this will help facilitate the retirement of the remaining 747s. The 747 retirement should improve our Pacific profitability by $100 million next year. And finally, we\u2019re adjusting our hub structure. Although it remains a very important asset to our network, we\u2019re reducing our reliance on connecting traffic in Tokyo and leveraging the size and scale of our domestic network through our Seattle Hub as we introduce additional direct service from the U.S. to Asia. All of these initiatives are already in motion and we\u2019ll drive returns in the region over the next several years consistent with our long-term financial goals. I\u2019ll conclude by simply saying that not only do we have a lot of opportunity to generate additional value from our international network, but we also have a clear plan on how we\u2019re going to get there. We\u2019ll continue to be disciplined with our capacity and focused on improving our margins and our returns. With that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Paul to go through the details on our cost and cash flow performance. Paul Jacobson : Thank you, Ed, and good morning everybody, and thank you joining us today. Our ongoing focus on cost performance was a significant contributor to our margin expansion this quarter. Total operating expenses increased by $320 million for the quarter with almost half of that driven by higher profit sharing expense. We held our non-fuel unit costs flat for the quarter marking the 5th consecutive quarter with ex-fuel CASM growth below 2%. This is further confirmation that our cost initiatives are delivering the benefits that we expected and with the organization rally behind this, we expect that trend to continue. One of our larger cost initiatives this year is the domestic re-fleeting. During the quarter, we took delivery of 22 aircraft and retired a total of 34 including 24 50 seaters. This strategy is producing significant operating leverage as we\u2019ve generated 2% higher domestic capacity year-to-date on 4.5% fewer departures. As we continue to retire 50 seaters in older mainline aircraft next year, we expect to see benefits and lower maintenance costs from a combination of avoided maintenance events and the ability to recycle parts from the retired fleet for use on the active fleet. This initiative drove $35 million of maintenance savings in the September quarter alone. While the growth rate of non-fuel unit costs in the December quarter should increase from recent levels due to the timing of the off peak maintenance events, we still expected to be less than 2% and in line with our long-term cost goal. Moving onto the fuel, our fuel expense for the quarter decreased by $23 million as lower fuel prices and the refineries improved profitability more than offset the increase in consumption from capacity growth. Our fuel price for the quarter was $2.90 per gallon with the benefit of $63 million of hedge gains in the quarter, an equivalent level to last year despite lower market fuel prices. The refinery made a $19 million profit for the quarter which lowered our fuel price by $0.02 per gallon. The refinery\u2019s profit represents a $16 million improvement over the same period last year. A key driver of the profitability was our domestic crude initiative as we processed 100,000 barrels per day of domestic crude during the quarter. We are on-pace to achieve our goal of averaging 70,000 barrels per day for the full year, which should increase to 100,000 barrels per day in 2015. For the December quarter, we\u2019re expecting to pay $2.69 to $2.74 per gallon for fuel including the refinery and hedge impacts. This includes the projected profit of the refinery of $20 million driven by widening crack spreads. The refinery team is running a great operation and continuous to generate meaningful year-over-year improvements there. At current crude prices, we\u2019ll have approximately $100 million of hedge losses in the December quarter while our 2015 hedge book is near breakeven with a solid amount of protection at current price levels. Even with these hedge losses, we\u2019ve participated in 80% of the price declines since late June. With the expected December quarter losses, our hedges reduced our overall fuel costs by roughly $160 million for 2014. Turning to cash, our strong cash generation continued to differentiate us from the industry. This quarter we generated $1.3 billion of operating cash flow and reinvested $411 million into the business primarily related to fleet. In the fourth quarter, we expect to spend $800 million on capital expenditures which will bring our total CapEx to approximately $2.3 billion for the year. With another quarter of solid cash generation ahead of us, we\u2019re on-track to produce $3.5 billion of free cash flow this year. We used that to continue to strengthen the balance sheet and return cash to shareholders with our $910 million of free cash flow during the quarter. Our adjusted net debt is down to $7.4 billion which held lower our interest expense by $60 million versus last year. We have a clear line of site to achieve our $5 billion adjusted net debt targeted 2016. During the September quarter, we also returned $325 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. We paid out $75 million in dividends as we increased our dividend by 50% to $0.09 per share. In addition, we repurchased $250 million in shares during the quarter. Once again I want to thank the entire Delta team for another record breaking quarter. Our performance this quarter and throughout this year shows what we can do when we all work together to drive change and deliver results. Congratulations to each of you on a great quarter. Jill? Jill Sullivan Greer : Thanks, everyone. Before I move to the Q&A, I just want to take a minute and remind everybody about our December Investor Day. We will have more details out shortly, but for now please mark your calendars for December 11th. So Kellian, if we could have the instructions as to how to ask the questions. Question: and: Operator : (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll hear first from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hi, good morning. I wonder, on your 2015 hedge book, if you could just give us a sense for how hedged you are and where the floors are on that. And then just remind us. When we see the mark-to-market changes on your book, should we interpret those as cash changes, or is some of that non-cash until it is realized? Thanks. Evercore Partners : Hi, good morning. I wonder, on your 2015 hedge book, if you could just give us a sense for how hedged you are and where the floors are on that. And then just remind us. When we see the mark-to-market changes on your book, should we interpret those as cash changes, or is some of that non-cash until it is realized? Thanks. Richard Anderson : Sure, good morning Duane. For 2015, we are hovering around 30% to 40% hedged at current levels. We\u2019ve got significant downside participation even from these levels down. But we managed the book day-to-day basis, so that can change overtime, but we feel very good about where we\u2019re positioned for 2015. You have to remember for mark-to-market we do not use FAS 133. So for other carriers and comparisons those changes go straight to equity. But those are largely non-cash for this quarter, the bulk of it was the reversal of prior gains in the hedge book and that\u2019s what has positioned us. So it tends to be a little bit noisy during these times but it doesn\u2019t represent necessarily cash losses. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay, thanks. Then just had one on your -- it seems like you are making some changes around your basic Economy product. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about some of those changes. Should we think about this as revenue initiatives in 2015, or is this unbundling effort a competitive response? And thanks for taking the questions. Evercore Partners : Okay, thanks. Then just had one on your -- it seems like you are making some changes around your basic Economy product. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about some of those changes. Should we think about this as revenue initiatives in 2015, or is this unbundling effort a competitive response? And thanks for taking the questions. Richard Anderson : I think you would look at basic economy, as we want to be best in class in every sector we reserve and if you think about airlines we don\u2019t -- we are so large in terms of domestic capacity that we don\u2019t get the choice to really be high-end brand, a medium brand and a lower brand. So, we have to create those brands within the master brand and when we compete against Spirit of course or other ultra low cost carriers we always want to have the best product competing against us. And so the products that we\u2019re introducing in basic economy you get the reliability of Delta, you get all the operation excellence of Delta, but you don\u2019t get some of the amenities that you don\u2019t need. And if you need those amenities you can add them on later. So, I think what we want to have is an airline that\u2019s best in class for each consumer sector and basic economy is one of the things that will enable us to do that. Ed Bastian : And in response to your question of, it is a revenue strategy. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thank you. Evercore Partners : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll hear next from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Dan McKenzie : Yes, hey, good morning, guys. Regarding the $2 billion share repurchase program through 2016, with the stock obviously sub $35, do you guys need an authorization from your Board to accelerate the buyback if you wanted? Or in theory, could you put that whole $2 billion to work this year if you wanted? Buckingham Research : Yes, hey, good morning, guys. Regarding the $2 billion share repurchase program through 2016, with the stock obviously sub $35, do you guys need an authorization from your Board to accelerate the buyback if you wanted? Or in theory, could you put that whole $2 billion to work this year if you wanted? Richard Anderson : Well, we do need to go back to our Board and our Board is quite focused on two things which is one return on invested capital and keeping that number high, and number two driving continued improvement in the returns to our shareholder. We expected our Investor Day to be in a position to update our investors because it is an incredibly accretive to the company to buyback our stock at these multiples. So, as Paul reiterated we\u2019re well ahead of where we said we would be last May and you can expect that we would continue that kind of trajectory particularly given the tremendous value that we can create for our owners by buying back our stock at these prices. Dan McKenzie : Okay, terrific. And then I guess for the -- my second question here. On growth to Europe, the headline news almost on a daily basis seems to be pretty negative : deflation, and Europe that risk of sliding into a recession. So it seems there is a fair amount of macro here. As you look ahead to next year, what are the data points that you are looking at that give you confidence on the demand backdrop and the growth of 1% to 3%? It seems like your peers have reached a different conclusion. But anyways, I am just wondering if you can provide a little bit more perspective there? Buckingham Research : Okay, terrific. And then I guess for the -- my second question here. On growth to Europe, the headline news almost on a daily basis seems to be pretty negative : deflation, and Europe that risk of sliding into a recession. So it seems there is a fair amount of macro here. As you look ahead to next year, what are the data points that you are looking at that give you confidence on the demand backdrop and the growth of 1% to 3%? It seems like your peers have reached a different conclusion. But anyways, I am just wondering if you can provide a little bit more perspective there? Glen Hauenstein : Our growth in Europe this year was really in September as one of the issues that I think our investors need to understand that for the last few years we\u2019ve been doing modification lines on our airplanes whether or not it\u2019s satellite TVs or whether or not it\u2019s flatbed seats those modification lines continue to need and by 2014 and 2015 it\u2019s really about getting better asset utilization on the existing asset base. And so to the extent that we can see extending some of the U.S. point of origin markets beyond August into September, and early October, we will continue to do that. And that\u2019s where really most of our growth has come from new markets or upgauge it comes from really using the existing asset base slightly better. As mostly for those markets U.S. point of origin destination travel. Dan McKenzie : Okay, thanks Glen, appreciate it. Buckingham Research : Okay, thanks Glen, appreciate it. Operator : We\u2019ll move onto Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Michael Linenberg : A couple questions here. Paul, given the pullback in WTI and Brent, we have also seen jet fuel prices come down, but crack spreads have actually gotten wider. I know you mentioned that as being a source of profitability for the refiner in the fourth quarter. What is going on with crack? Why have they widened so much? Deutsche Bank : A couple questions here. Paul, given the pullback in WTI and Brent, we have also seen jet fuel prices come down, but crack spreads have actually gotten wider. I know you mentioned that as being a source of profitability for the refiner in the fourth quarter. What is going on with crack? Why have they widened so much? Paul Jacobson : Good morning Mike. Thanks for the question. What this sell off has been a very brand driven sell off where cracks tend to lag that and I think when you compound that with some of the supply delivery issues in the Northeast some refineries have come offline putting temporary pressure on those crack spreads. We are running near full capacity and expect to do so for most of the quarter. So I think when you combine it with temporary shutdowns with some of the supply disruptions that put a little bit of pressure on cracks. Richard Anderson : Michael, now perhaps folks -- not now perhaps folks will better understand our refinery strategy. Michael Linenberg : Very good. My second question; and Richard, this is either for you or Ed. Look, Air France just went through -- I want to say the worst strike in I think two decades. They were running, I want to say 40% for two weeks. It doesn't look like it's in your numbers in the trans-Atlantic, but I am sure it had an impact. Can you talk about what the impact was, or maybe how you were able, just working together, able to deal with it? Deutsche Bank : Very good. My second question; and Richard, this is either for you or Ed. Look, Air France just went through -- I want to say the worst strike in I think two decades. They were running, I want to say 40% for two weeks. It doesn't look like it's in your numbers in the trans-Atlantic, but I am sure it had an impact. Can you talk about what the impact was, or maybe how you were able, just working together, able to deal with it? Richard Anderson : Well, remember that a big network and that there were opportunities over Amsterdam and all of our flights ran really full. So we had Glen talked about a little extra capacity in September it happened to be at the perfect time because we absorbed an enormous amount of that and actually had a pretty nice uplift in revenue. Operator : And from Bank of America, we\u2019ll go next to Glenn Engel. Glenn Engel : A couple of questions, I guess, by your guidance other than Africa, you were not seeing any Ebola effect? Bank of America Merrill Lynch : A couple of questions, I guess, by your guidance other than Africa, you were not seeing any Ebola effect? Richard Anderson : We monitor it on a daily basis, and we have not seen any changes in the booking trends. Glenn Engel : What type of currency headwinds are implied in your numbers in the fourth quarter? Bank of America Merrill Lynch : What type of currency headwinds are implied in your numbers in the fourth quarter? Richard Anderson : Glen we\u2019re looking at obviously pressure on the yen. I think for the fourth quarter that number is in the $25 million to $30 million range of FX exposure. Glenn Engel : But in the euro it\u2019s both revenue and an expense hit so it will show up in lower RASM but lower CASM? Bank of America Merrill Lynch : But in the euro it\u2019s both revenue and an expense hit so it will show up in lower RASM but lower CASM? Richard Anderson : Yes, exactly. Glenn Engel : And Glen if I mark-to-market where interest rates are today, what type of headwinds can we expect in pension next year? And is there any plan to change the balance of profit share versus wages for your workforce? Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And Glen if I mark-to-market where interest rates are today, what type of headwinds can we expect in pension next year? And is there any plan to change the balance of profit share versus wages for your workforce? Glen Hauenstein : On the pension side Glenn I think we\u2019re looking at a potential balance sheet adjustment of around $1 billion which is comparable slightly less than what we took back last year. That\u2019s not going to have a material effect on pension expense next year with our funding strategy and the other changes. Richard Anderson : And Glenn on your second question, our formula here at Delta works pretty well. As evidenced by the performance, our performance over the last several years and particularly in this quarter. So, we\u2019re very careful about changing anything in that mix given our success. Glenn Engel : I just assumed at last -- at the start of this year you changed a little bit and I was wondering whether there was more wage increases you would announce for early next year whether that was going to be the same? Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I just assumed at last -- at the start of this year you changed a little bit and I was wondering whether there was more wage increases you would announce for early next year whether that was going to be the same? Richard Anderson : We\u2019ve already made our wage increase announcement. We did it as part of our early profit sharing payout. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to Julie Yates with Credit Suisse. Julie Yates : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. This is a question for Paul. How should we think about 2015 non-fuel unit costs, taking into account the recent wage increase and if a pilot deal work to get done sooner than later? How comfortable do you feel you can still achieve the less than 2% growth in non-fuel CASM again after such strong cost performance over the last five quarters? Credit Suisse : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. This is a question for Paul. How should we think about 2015 non-fuel unit costs, taking into account the recent wage increase and if a pilot deal work to get done sooner than later? How comfortable do you feel you can still achieve the less than 2% growth in non-fuel CASM again after such strong cost performance over the last five quarters? Paul Jacobson : Good morning, Julie. Well, heading into 2015 as we\u2019re developing our operating plan right now, we still have the benefit of further increases in operating leverages as we continue to re-fleet and upgauge the airline, so that\u2019s providing a lot of tailwind. We do have some cost pressures in 2015 but we have those every year. So we feel confident about our ability to keep it below 2% again next year. Julie Yates : Okay, great. And then can you guys update us on the outstanding wide body RFP? Do you still expect to make a decision by the end of the year? Credit Suisse : Okay, great. And then can you guys update us on the outstanding wide body RFP? Do you still expect to make a decision by the end of the year? Richard Anderson : This is, Richard, yes. We\u2019re still working diligently on evaluating both the Airbus and Boeing option. They both have very strong viable options, as do the engine manufacturers Rolls-Royce and GE. And we are in the midst of a very heated competition to see which of those will bring to the table the best economics for our owners. Remarkably right now, it\u2019s an interesting development in the wide-body market because there is so many orders out there the used market is really heating up and the pricing for 10 year-old wide-bodies is about 30% of what you\u2019d otherwise pay. So it\u2019s going to be a very interesting process because the most important thing about this for us is not operating cost its ownership costs and I think that\u2019s how candidly the whole industry are focused on ownership cost. Operator : And Jamie Baker with JPMorgan has our next question. Jamie Baker : Richard, just as a follow-up on the aircraft question, has fuel's recent decline had any impact on the RFP negotiations or pricing, or how you even think about the new orders that reside in your pipeline at the moment? JPMorgan: Richard, just as a follow-up on the aircraft question, has fuel's recent decline had any impact on the RFP negotiations or pricing, or how you even think about the new orders that reside in your pipeline at the moment? Richard Anderson : No, we\u2019re relatively short tailed because -- and the problem with big airplane orders is escalation clauses and PDPs. You don\u2019t want to get way out in front of an order or you end up giving up all the competitive economics of the fly off. So we tend to build long-term models that put pretty high fuel prices in because I don\u2019t think, if you take the last 10 years of fuel prices in the industry, there has been a lot of variability but the line has been an upward sloping line. And so we have used very conservative assumptions when we build our financial models to determine what to buy. So from that standpoint, we aren\u2019t going to change our price per gallon assumption over the next 30 years as a result of the short-term changes in crude prices. Jamie Baker : Okay; I appreciate that. Thanks, Richard. My second question -- and, wow, I don't know who wants to take this one. Maybe Glen, but I am curious about how you model for new routes and whether that has evolved at all over time, and in particular whether you consider earnings multiple-destruction. I don't have the tools to say whether your next market from LA is going to earn a fully allocated profit. But I do have the ability to tell you that when you add capacity, particularly into OA hubs, it diminishes shareholder confidence; it suggests a lack of discipline; and in my opinion, it jeopardizes the likelihood of earning a multiple closer to that of high-quality industrial transport. So I know it may be difficult to quantify, but do you ever stop before you announce a route and just ask, or maybe run it past others : What if this destroys tens of millions of dollars of shareholder value by robbing me of a better earnings multiple? JPMorgan: Okay; I appreciate that. Thanks, Richard. My second question -- and, wow, I don't know who wants to take this one. Maybe Glen, but I am curious about how you model for new routes and whether that has evolved at all over time, and in particular whether you consider earnings multiple-destruction.

So I know it may be difficult to quantify, but do you ever stop before you announce a route and just ask, or maybe run it past others : What if this destroys tens of millions of dollars of shareholder value by robbing me of a better earnings multiple? Glen Hauenstein : See Jamie, it sounds like you\u2019ve asked and answered that question. Jamie Baker : Well, Glen, in fairness, I'm going to ask it of others this season. So this is not uniquely directed? JPMorgan: Well, Glen, in fairness, I'm going to ask it of others this season. So this is not uniquely directed? Glen Hauenstein : Look, I mean think you\u2019re in an area that is in some respect it\u2019s not appropriate for an earnings call. But I will just say this, look at our results I don\u2019t think there is a more disciplined approach to the deployment of capital in this industry anywhere in the world and we\u2019ll continue to make the right unilateral decisions and we appreciate that you have a different opinion. Jamie Baker : Well, and it is not necessarily mine, Glen -- or Richard. I am passing along the question that I have been asked here. But I appreciate your concise answer and we will leave it at that? That's fine. Thank you.  JPMorgan: Well, and it is not necessarily mine, Glen -- or Richard. I am passing along the question that I have been asked here. But I appreciate your concise answer and we will leave it at that? That's fine. Thank you. Operator : And from Morgan Stanley, we\u2019ll go to John Godyn. John Godyn : Hey, thank you for taking my question here. I wanted to follow up a little bit on some of the capacity commentary. First of all, we have certainly heard some criticisms; and Jamie reflected some of those on the competitive capacity adds. But maybe enough airtime isn't spent on where you are cutting capacity, because at the end of the day your aggregate capacity growth is still relatively disciplined. I was hoping the team could elaborate a bit on what is funding these growth initiatives in certain regions, like the trans-Atlantic, like in Seattle, and perhaps like in LA? Morgan Stanley : Hey, thank you for taking my question here. I wanted to follow up a little bit on some of the capacity commentary. First of all, we have certainly heard some criticisms; and Jamie reflected some of those on the competitive capacity adds. But maybe enough airtime isn't spent on where you are cutting capacity, because at the end of the day your aggregate capacity growth is still relatively disciplined. I was hoping the team could elaborate a bit on what is funding these growth initiatives in certain regions, like the trans-Atlantic, like in Seattle, and perhaps like in LA? Richard Anderson : I think this is a great question and I think what we continue to do is discover the network and find underperforming assets and try and move them up the scale. And so really to go back to the previous question and would say, what really happened in Seattle and Los Angeles, we increased capacity significantly on a year-over-year basis and margins in both those hubs increased at the same time. So what we were doing was trying to find the worst assets across the whole network wherever they were and redeploy them into better revenue potential opportunities. And that was really a key contributor to the improvement and the profitability of the airline. So, I understand the criticism, I understand the uncertainty of it, but the business continues to evolve and it continues to evolve as a consolidation of the four major carriers continues. And I think in Los Angeles we\u2019ve had four large carriers that\u2019s just the way it's going to be, in Seattle you have two large carriers that\u2019s the way it's going to be. John Godyn : Got it, then the guidance for next year, 2% ASM growth and the context being sub-GDP, it does feel like -- not that I am an economist per se, but it does feel like GDP expectations globally are being revised almost daily in the marketplace. I am just curious. Do you feel like there is downside risk to that number if things get worse? Is that a number that is struck as recently as last week, or was that a planning process that occurred a month ago? If you could just help put some boundaries around where capacity could go from here in the context of some of these global growth concerns, that would also be helpful? Morgan Stanley : Got it, then the guidance for next year, 2% ASM growth and the context being sub-GDP, it does feel like -- not that I am an economist per se, but it does feel like GDP expectations globally are being revised almost daily in the marketplace. I am just curious. Do you feel like there is downside risk to that number if things get worse? Is that a number that is struck as recently as last week, or was that a planning process that occurred a month ago? If you could just help put some boundaries around where capacity could go from here in the context of some of these global growth concerns, that would also be helpful? Richard Anderson : Thanks, John. You heard the, in the guidance we also said we expect our international capacity next year to be flat. So, I think that clearly addresses the question you\u2019ve raised with respect to some of the international economic concerns. Pacific where we\u2019re having clearly the most highest level of capacity concentration coming primarily from Foreign flags we\u2019re in the midst of a pretty significant restructuring of that capacity offering. And we said Pacific will be down in the high single-digits. Next year in Europe the majority of our capacity adds we\u2019re thinking will primarily be in London, which is producing significant returns as part of the Virgin JV and I think the bulk of the overall system-wide capacity add next year is going to be in the domestic system and it is going to be reflective of the upgauging initiatives that we\u2019re doing as both margin accretive and very incredibly cost efficient. John Godyn : That\u2019s very helpful. And just last one. Morgan Stanley : That\u2019s very helpful. And just last one. Richard Anderson : And John, last one as I\u2019d like to add to that as obviously we\u2019re speculating we have got a long ways to go here and these deployment decisions. Our current thinking but as we get into the year, we also have the ability to make alterations on a relatively quick timeframe given the capital efficiency of our fleet. John Godyn : Great and I just want to follow-up on one of the things you mentioned which is upgauging. As we think about the 2% capacity growth for next year, can you give us a sense of what the seat count growth and fleet growth underlying that is, we\u2019ve certainly seen departures and seats underperform ASMs meaningfully, it does feel like maybe the trend is even more conservative than 2% would suggest? Morgan Stanley : Great and I just want to follow-up on one of the things you mentioned which is upgauging. As we think about the 2% capacity growth for next year, can you give us a sense of what the seat count growth and fleet growth underlying that is, we\u2019ve certainly seen departures and seats underperform ASMs meaningfully, it does feel like maybe the trend is even more conservative than 2% would suggest? Richard Anderson : I agree with that we are going to update you at the December Investor Day, the fleet count will be down next year. But we\u2019ll give you the ins and outs because you are right there, so moving pieces to that picture. John Godyn : Great. Thanks a lot guys. Morgan Stanley : Great. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi Syth : Hey, good morning. On the U.S. dollar strengthening, I was just wondering if you could provide -- I know you provided a little bit on the trans-Atlantic but just, how much is your international sales are kind of on U.S. point of sale versus international? Raymond James : Hey, good morning. On the U.S. dollar strengthening, I was just wondering if you could provide -- I know you provided a little bit on the trans-Atlantic but just, how much is your international sales are kind of on U.S. point of sale versus international? Richard Anderson : On an aggregate level about 60% is U.S. based. Savi Syth : 60% of international sales are U.S. based. Raymond James : 60% of international sales are U.S. based. Richard Anderson : Yes. Savi Syth : Okay, got it. Then just from an ancillary revenue standpoint, it's been great performance here, a lot of it coming from Economy upsale and things like that. As we look into 2015, what kind of items can we think of as driving ancillary revenue growth? Raymond James : Okay, got it. Then just from an ancillary revenue standpoint, it's been great performance here, a lot of it coming from Economy upsale and things like that. As we look into 2015, what kind of items can we think of as driving ancillary revenue growth? Richard Anderson : I think that we have a lot of new initiatives which we\u2019ll be talking about in the marketplace over the next two to three months, probably give you an update at Investor Day. But we\u2019re extremely excited about being able to allow customers to really customize their travel experience on Delta. Savi Syth : Got it. Alright. Thank you. Raymond James : Got it. Alright. Thank you. Operator : And from Goldman Sachs we\u2019ll move to Thomas Kim. Thomas Kim : Thanks. I have a couple questions on pricing. First off, can you walk us through the PRASM guidance? I am wondering to what extent the low end of the guidance is being conservative; or does this in fact maybe reflect some risk with regard to erosion in pricing power? Whether it is in the US, which seems unlikely, but I know I certainly would appreciate color there; or maybe further deterioration in Asia, which is obviously reflected in some of the capacity decisions; or maybe even Latam. So if you can just help us understand the lower end of the guidance, that would be very helpful? Thank you. Goldman Sachs : Thanks. I have a couple questions on pricing. First off, can you walk us through the PRASM guidance? I am wondering to what extent the low end of the guidance is being conservative; or does this in fact maybe reflect some risk with regard to erosion in pricing power? Whether it is in the US, which seems unlikely, but I know I certainly would appreciate color there; or maybe further deterioration in Asia, which is obviously reflected in some of the capacity decisions; or maybe even Latam. So if you can just help us understand the lower end of the guidance, that would be very helpful? Thank you. Richard Anderson : Tom I think you answered a lot of your question, we gave you our best view as we\u2019re seeing today. I think the strength of the ford environment and the domestic system is where the bulk of our upside opportunity sits. Ed Bastian : And let me just add for everybody on the call, we will not discuss pricing. And we will not discuss capacity among competitors on these calls today or in the future because it\u2019s not appropriate. And it\u2019s not appropriate for the analyst community that be engaging in what forward capacity and pricing decisions are at Delta. Thomas Kim : Okay. Can I ask a broader question, just with regard to how you see the industry, thinking about how their revenue environment might change or adjust with the change in the cost environment? One would -- fuel in particular, this is one where we have seen historically, where prices or revenues have generally moved directionally in line with where oil price has gone. And I am wondering, just given the strength of the domestic market, could we in the market or the investment community be underestimating the potential impact of how much lower fuel price should really benefit profitability as we look out to the fourth quarter, but importantly out into \u201915? Goldman Sachs : Okay. Can I ask a broader question, just with regard to how you see the industry, thinking about how their revenue environment might change or adjust with the change in the cost environment? One would -- fuel in particular, this is one where we have seen historically, where prices or revenues have generally moved directionally in line with where oil price has gone. And I am wondering, just given the strength of the domestic market, could we in the market or the investment community be underestimating the potential impact of how much lower fuel price should really benefit profitability as we look out to the fourth quarter, but importantly out into \u201915? Richard Anderson : Let me just answer it generally. We can\u2019t speak on behalf of the industry, we can only speak on behalf of Delta and that\u2019s all we will speak on behalf of. But when you think about where fuel prices are today versus where they were just a few weeks ago, it\u2019s in excess of a $1 billion of cost of goods sold improvement. So overall the fuel price reductions we\u2019ve seen in the marketplace are a huge opportunity going forward. Jill Sullivan Greer : Alright, we\u2019re going to have time for one more call from the analysts. Operator : And that will be from David Fintzen with Barclays. David Fintzen : Hey, good morning, everyone. Hopefully this is on the right side of, Richard, your commentary on capacity. I am just curious, though. Fuel is obviously -- I get the commentary on how you do fleet versus long-term fuel prices. But I am curious. How should we be thinking about tactical moves or utilization flying in off-peaks, when fuel is whipping around like this? I presume we have to obviously have a view. Is that similar to fleet, where you're not taking it into account? Or should we start thinking differently about what you might do in the first quarter if fuel stays here? Barclays Capital : Hey, good morning, everyone. Hopefully this is on the right side of, Richard, your commentary on capacity. I am just curious, though. Fuel is obviously -- I get the commentary on how you do fleet versus long-term fuel prices. But I am curious. How should we be thinking about tactical moves or utilization flying in off-peaks, when fuel is whipping around like this? I presume we have to obviously have a view. Is that similar to fleet, where you're not taking it into account? Or should we start thinking differently about what you might do in the first quarter if fuel stays here? Richard Anderson : Well, I mean that -- as we said, we\u2019ll update our 2015 capacity plan for Delta only at the December Investor Day. But just broadly, we\u2019re driven by profitability and return on invested capital. And what that means is that we make fleet planning decisions we include ownership costs and we include ownership costs even in our short-term planning. So, the bottom-line is we want that 19% return on invested capital on a consistent basis and in order for us to do that we\u2019ve got to be very adroit at deploying our capital to make sure we get a return or the maximum return every quarter. David Fintzen : That helps quite a bit. I think the rest of mine have been asked already. So, I\u2019ll step back. Thank you. Barclays Capital : That helps quite a bit. I think the rest of mine have been asked already. So, I\u2019ll step back. Thank you. Jill Sullivan Greer : That is going to conclude the analyst portion of the call. Before we turn it over to the media portion, I do want to say that there were a sizeable number of analysts that didn\u2019t get on the call. And we will follow-up with each of you directly offline. And with that, I will hand it over to Kevin Shinkle. Kevin Shinkle : Hi. This is Kevin Shinkle, the Chief Communications Officer. Thanks to the reporters who are on the call. I would like to say that, and we have about 10 minutes so if you can keep it to one question and a brief follow-up it would be great. So with that, I\u2019ll turn over to Kellian for repeat of instructions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll go first to David Koenig, The Associated Press. David Koenig : I think Richard if you could answer this just curious what you think about the CDC\u2019s decision to let that second nurse fly on that Frontier flight less than 21 days after her possible exposure to Ebola and I heard your comments earlier about your booking. But what do you think of that decision? The Associated Press : I think Richard if you could answer this just curious what you think about the CDC\u2019s decision to let that second nurse fly on that Frontier flight less than 21 days after her possible exposure to Ebola and I heard your comments earlier about your booking. But what do you think of that decision? Richard Anderson : Well, I think Dr. Frieden was very clear in stating that the CDC made a mistake. I think what\u2019s worth noting is you really can\u2019t catch Ebola on an airplane. And the screening techniques that the governments put in place are going to detect folks coming from the risk areas in Africa in advance of entering United States. So, I think that Dr. Frieden has done a good job answering that question. David Koenig : So does that mean you have confidence that the government is going to get this right? The Associated Press : So does that mean you have confidence that the government is going to get this right? Richard Anderson : Yes. David Koenig : Okay, thanks.  The Associated Press : Okay, thanks. Operator : And from Thomson Reuters we\u2019ll move to Jeffrey Gaston. Jeffrey Gaston : Thank you and good morning. What additional steps might Delta to take convince investors that Ebola will not impact the airline\u2019s future performance? Thomson Reuters : Thank you and good morning. What additional steps might Delta to take convince investors that Ebola will not impact the airline\u2019s future performance? Gil West : Hi. This is Gil West. Well, first, I\u2019d just point out, this isn\u2019t the first communicable disease that we faced as an airline or an industry. And we\u2019re well versed at managing these type of events ensuring the safety of our customers and crews. We have got a corporate safety and security staff that\u2019s in continuous dialogue with the CDC and World Health Organization, and we adhered all their recommendations. I just point the virus is as -- I am sure you know is extremely difficult to transmit. A person has to have symptoms to be contagious. As Richard pointed out, there are CDC screening protocols in place in and out of all the West African countries as well as into the U.S. and the EU to prevent a person with symptoms from flying. We\u2019ve also got well established hygienic cleaning procedures and use disinfectants prior to every flight. And then the CDC -- and I continue to point out that there is virtually no risk to all air travelers no matter where you travel. Jeffrey Gaston : Thank you and I may ask a brief follow-up on, has Delta taken any steps to protect itself against employees that potentially could sue the Company as Ebola spreads? Thomson Reuters : Thank you and I may ask a brief follow-up on, has Delta taken any steps to protect itself against employees that potentially could sue the Company as Ebola spreads? Gil West : On the employee side, yes, we\u2019ve got -- I mean if I understood your question when we\u2019re talking about employees, I mean we have ongoing dialogue with our flight crews and awareness and educational campaigns as well as provisioning the aircraft with preventative kits in case they do encounter anything unusual. Operator : We\u2019ll move onto Mike Sasso with Bloomberg News. Mike Sasso : I actually had a question, are you seeing any reticence by pilots or flight attendants to fly certain routes and I am thinking West Africa. I did hear something about speculation that maybe high senior pilots are bidding off of those routes? Are you seeing any of that from any of your ranks of employees? Bloomberg News : I actually had a question, are you seeing any reticence by pilots or flight attendants to fly certain routes and I am thinking West Africa. I did hear something about speculation that maybe high senior pilots are bidding off of those routes? Are you seeing any of that from any of your ranks of employees? Joanne Smith : Hi, this is Joanne Smith, and the answer is no. We\u2019re not seeing any pilots or flight attendants who are bidding off and it\u2019s a very flexible bidding system and certainly the opportunity for swapping trips is there, but we\u2019re not seeing any issues specific to this, also for Africa. Operator : And we\u2019ll move now to Linda Loyd with Philadelphia Inquirer. Linda Loyd : You mentioned that the refinery made a $19 million profit in the third quarter and then you referred to a $20 million profit and I just didn\u2019t hear whether you said that was for the fourth quarter or the year. I just wasn\u2019t sure what you said? Philadelphia Inquirer : You mentioned that the refinery made a $19 million profit in the third quarter and then you referred to a $20 million profit and I just didn\u2019t hear whether you said that was for the fourth quarter or the year. I just wasn\u2019t sure what you said? Paul Jacobson : Hi, Linda, this is Paul Jacobson. We, that was guidance for the fourth quarter, so we produced a $19 million profit in the third quarter and we anticipate approximately a $20 million profit for the fourth quarter, the team up there is doing a fabulous job of running the plant and they\u2019re keeping it up and operational. Linda Loyd : So do you expect the refinery to be profitable for the entire year 2014? Philadelphia Inquirer : So do you expect the refinery to be profitable for the entire year 2014? Paul Jacobson : It will be close for the entire for the full year 2014, yes. Linda Loyd : Close to profitable? Philadelphia Inquirer : Close to profitable? Paul Jacobson : Yes. Richard Anderson : Okay, with that, that concludes our call for today. Thank you very much. Operator : And again, that will conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for joining us.",

At this time all participants are in a listen only mode until we conduct a question and answering session following today\u2019s presentation. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Jill Sullivan Greer, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Jill Sullivan Greer : Here in Atlanta today we have Richard Anderson our CEO, Ed Bastian our President, and Paul Jacobson, our CFO, and we have the remainder of the leadership team here in the room with us for Q&A. Richard will open the call, Ed will then address our financial and revenue performance, and Paul will conclude with a review of cost performance and cash flows. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow up. Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta\u2019s SEC filings. We\u2019ll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted.  You\u2019ll find the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the investor relation\u2019s page at ir.Delta.com. With that, I will turn the call over to Richard. Richard H. Anderson : This morning Delta reported a $1 billion pretax profit for the December quarter with EPS of $0.77 which beat consensus of $0.75. We grew the top line 6% despite a fuel price decline of 14%. Delta expanded margins by over four points. For 2014 we generated a $4.5 billion pretax profit, an increase of 70% over 2013. Revenues grew for the full year by 7% and we expanded our operating margin by four points to 13.1%. Our ROIC was 20.7%.  We generated $5.8 billion of operating cash flow and $3.7 billion of free cash flow and returned $1.35 billion of cash to our owners. Delta was the sixth best performing stock in the S&P 500 with a 79% gain. In two years we have increased our market cap by $30 billion. Our $3.7 billion of free cash flow was better than 90% of the S&P Industrials and Delta has the third highest free cash flow yield of the S&P Industrials. These results include over $1 billion of profit sharing for our employees equal to more than 16% of their 2014 pay. We are proud of that at Delta and I want to thank the entire Delta team for their hard work that is the reason why we were successful in 2014. We ran the best operation in the global aviation industry with 95 days of no main line cancellations, a completion factor of 99.8% and an on time rate of 85% excluding the onetime impacts of the winter storms in 1Q of \u201814.  Remarkably, Delta had only 414 main line maintenance cancellations for all of 2014, a number that our competitors sometimes exceed in a single month. That operational excellence, along with investments we\u2019ve made in products and services drove increases in our customer satisfaction with our domestic net promotor score increasing more than two points to 33%. High customer sat translates into a revenue premium as customers have showed a willingness to pay for high quality service. For 2014 we generated 107% of industry average revenues across the system and a 113% domestic RASM premium. We continually obtain efficiency and productivity which caused roughly flat non-fuel costs year-on-year in 2014. These factors combined to produce a $1.9 billion increase in our pretax profit for 2014. This profitability translated into strong cash flows which produced $6 billion of operating cash flow and allowed $2.1 billion of capital investments. We used a portion of that to strengthen our balance sheet reducing our net debt to $7.3 billion. Our stronger balance sheet has been recognized by rating agencies as we are just two notches away from investment grade. We run the company on investment grade metrics and strive to obtain investment grade ratings. We are exceeding our long term shareholder commitments. Our long term op margin goal is 11% to 14%, we achieved 13.1%. EPS growth long term goal is 10% to 15%, we achieved 70% growth on a pretax basis. Our ROIC goal is 15% to 18%, we hit 20.7%. Our free cash flow goal was $3 billion, we hit $3.7 billion. We make decisions in the business for the long term. We\u2019re focused and disciplined. We manage our capacity, capital, and costs tightly. We drive high ROIC. We\u2019re focused on growing free cash flow and raising cash shareholder returns. We believe these are the most important metrics for large cap long term equity owners. Our top line growth is strong which is driven by operational and service excellence. We have increased our earnings by $3 billion since 2012 and generated $6.5 billion in free cash flow over that time. We expect to significantly improve on this performance in 2015.  There\u2019s a tremendous opportunity in front of us from lower fuel prices. We will drive these savings to the bottom line with strong revenue growth and yield preservation regardless of fuel prices. At current fuel prices, we expect to capture over $2 billion in fuel savings benefit in 2015 net of our hedges. If fuel remains at these levels we are set up to fully participate in recent fuel declines during 2016. In addition, our hedge book provides excellent protection should fuel rise from current levels.  We will use the decline in fuel prices as an opportunity to accelerate progress towards our long term goals. Fuel will remain volatile in 2015. We are not making any changes to our 2015 capacity plan in light of the lower fuel prices. In fact, we continue to trim capacity on the margin to maintain yields and our RASM premium. Between fuel savings and the benefits of our revenue initiatives, we expect to produce a significant pretax profit increase in 2015. These higher earnings should translate into growing free cash flow which will be allocated between strengthening the balance sheet and returning cash to our owners. Our top priority continues to be paying down debt. We expect to have our adjusted net debt below $6 billion by the end of this year and achieve a $5 billion target next year. We will contribute over $9 billion - $900 million to our pension plans this year which marks the third year of excess contributions to the plan to address that obligation. We will accelerate our capital returns to our owners with a minimum of $1.5 billion in dividends and buy backs this year. We will complete our repurchase authorization by the end of 2015, a full year ahead of schedule. Similar to the past two years, we will update you on our capital deployment plans in May after our board of directors completes its annual strategic plan review in the spring meeting of 2015. As we discussed at our investor day last month, our work lies in continuing to build a durable industrial company with strong financial performance throughout the cycle. We\u2019re making great progress. We\u2019ve got the right people and the right strategies to continue to do so. Delta today has the fourth lowest PE of the S&P Industrials so there is much opportunity ahead. The operating environment for Delta and the overall industry in the US is remarkably good. Carbon price declines are a huge benefit to the overall US economy. In addition, the US is experiencing a pilot shortage at the regionals caused by the 1,500 hour rule and the long term hiring trends at the majors. At Delta the large size of the airline requires 12 to 18 months of advanced planning to significantly change our capacity plans. The same is true across the industry. These jet fuel savings are enormous and we are diligent at maintaining those savings for the bottom line. In high level conceptual terms at Delta, the first quarter is a good indicator of the macro trends for 2015. We expect to keep our RASM and non-fuel CASM about flat in 1Q. Capacity growth will be about 5% but just 3% net of last year\u2019s weather. With fewer airplanes and fewer departures with revenues growing 7% fuel savings will go to the bottom line which will set up for a very strong 1Q and these trends in 1Q bode well for all of 2015.  Thanks for your support and I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ed who will detail our strategies and commercial initiatives. Edward H. Bastian : For the December quarter our pretax income increased $474 million year-over-year to just over $1 billion. Our net income was $649 million or $0.78 per share which was generally in line with consensus of $0.77. We expanded our operating margin by more than 400 basis points to 12.6%. Our results for the quarter include $262 million in profit sharing expense which brings the total for the year to $1.1 billion.  2014 was a fantastic year on all fronts and it will be an honor to be able to reward the Delta team come profit sharing day for driving industry leading operational, customer service, and financial results. These results have led Delta to be the second best performing stock in the S&P 500 over the last two years. Hats off to our 80,000 strong.  We had solid revenue performance growing the top line against a back drop of significantly lower fuel prices. Passenger revenues increased 4.6% on 3.7% higher capacity. 2014 has been a strong year in corporate sales with our corporate revenues increasing 7%. We saw the strongest performance this year in the financial services, media, and automotive sectors. This corporate sales growth was a key factor in driving our New York hub to profitability. In our most recent Ford Corporate Travel Survey, 88% of our customers anticipate increasing or at least maintaining travel spend in Q1 and over the balance of 2015. We also saw good traction with our ancillary and merchandising revenues which increased by 16% for the quarter. Our first class paid load factor increased by six points to 49% and we did that off a base of 8% more first class seats than last year. Our revenues for our premium economy product comfort plus, increased by 18% and we\u2019re now generating an annual incremental revenue stream of roughly $350 million. Passenger unit revenues grew 1% with our strongest performance in the domestic entity.  International faced headwinds from the dollar\u2019s strength versus both the Euro and the Yen, which combined with the impact of our service reduction to Venezuela, impacted revenues by $60 million and lowered system unit revenues by about 6.6 points. Domestic unit revenues increased nearly 3% on 3.6% higher capacity. We\u2019re especially pleased with our performance in New York and Seattle which have built good momentum as we\u2019ve been upgaging the domestic fleet and investing in our networks, products, and facilities in those two cities. Seattle\u2019s domestic unit revenue grew 6% on 33% higher capacity.  In the Trans-Atlantic unit revenues declined slightly on 2% higher capacity. Our best performance was to Europe especially, Amsterdam and Paris where our joint venture with Air France [indiscernible] helped produced unit revenue increases above the entity average. We continue to face headwinds in Africa, the Middle East, and Russia which pressured European entity unit revenues by more than two points despite 13% capacity reductions in those markets. Our joint venture with Virgin Atlantic continues to perform well with an 800 basis point margin improvement in the quarter on 2% increase in capacity. Our Latin unit revenues declined 4% on 15% higher capacity but nearly all of the unit revenue decline was driven by our capacity reduction into Venezuela. Our investments in Latin America are paying off as we had strong performance in Mexico and Brazil. Our commercial partnerships with Aero Mexico and Gulf are driving higher yielding traffic onto our core business markets. Those two carriers accounted for $35 million in incremental revenue for the quarter.  In the Pacific our unit revenues declined 5% on slightly lower capacity as the entity continues to see pressure from the weakened Yen. Net of hedges, the Yen reduced revenue by $31 million and pressured unit revenues by four of those five points. Since we\u2019ve began down gaging the 747s and restructuring our Narita hub, we have already seen nearly $25 million improvement on our Tokyo routes in Q4.  Turning to guidance, Richard made an important point earlier, the focus of the commercial team is to continue to grow revenues as we seek to drive the fuel savings to the bottom line. We are seeing some continuing pressure on international unit revenues from the stronger dollar and lower fuel surcharges. In the domestic market demand and revenues remain solid. We are forecasting our March quarter revenues to increase about 7% with RASM roughly flat on 5% higher capacity. That forecast includes about a point of unit revenue pressure and two points of capacity growth from last year\u2019s winter storm so schedule-over-schedule our capacity will be up roughly 3%. The storm impact will also affect the monthly RASM op ex. We expect our January RASM will be the lowest performer with monthly results progressively improving as we move through the quarter. Our revenue growth combined with $0.50 to $0.60 in lower fuel prices and solid non-fuel costs productivity should result in an operating margin of 11% to 13%. This is a 400 basis point improvement compared to last March\u2019s quarter and a 500 basis point improvement on pre-tax earnings. Looking ahead, we face about $300 million of revenue headwinds in 2015 from the stronger dollar, close to a full point of RASM but we have a number of revenue initiatives that give us confidence that we can not only overcome that pressure but continue to grow revenues through the year. First, we\u2019re continuing to make adjustments to our network to improve our revenue and our margins. While we will make incremental capacity additions in New York, Seattle, and Los Angeles this year, we are also focused on tactically adjusting the gage and frequency of flying to better match demand including, deciding this week to take 1.5 points out of our domestic schedule starting in March. In Latin America, our growth will tail off in the back half of the year. We are already seeing benefits in those markets as our capacity additions have matured and we expect to see that momentum build as we go through 2015. We will also benefit as we begin to lap the impact of our Venezuelan reductions later this year. In the Pacific, we continue to restructure our network in light of continued pressure from the weakened Yen. This will take a couple of years as we retire the 747s and back fill a portion of that flying with new smaller gaged aircraft. However, we expect to make good progress in 2015 as we will retire five additional 747s which will reduce capacity into Japan by 15%. Second, we have strong opportunity in our joint venture and our investment with Virgin Atlantic which we expect to produce $200 million of benefit this year alone. We just celebrated the first anniversary of our joint venture and we are gaining familiarity and expertise as we cooperate on pricing, scheduling, and capacity decisions. Delta and Virgin combined will increase our US to Heathrow capacity by 10% in 2015. Our increased service to London Heathrow, a key market that Delta didn\u2019t serve just a few years ago, has been a stronger driver of the momentum we\u2019ve seen in our corporate sales growth. A third focus for our commercial team is rolling out our branded fair initiatives. Our basic economy product is already in over 75 markets and is producing strong results as we continue to expand it into additional domestic and Latin markets. Finally, we\u2019ve changed SkyMiles from a distance based program to a spend based program. This change should drive higher revenues from a stronger customer loyalty as we put rewards into our most valuable customers and we are already receiving positive feedback from them. We were also able to translate the value of our frequent flyer program into improved terms in a new agreement we reached with American Express which we announced last month. That new agreement which went into effect on January the 1st is expected to delivery several hundred million in higher revenues to Delta this year through a 15% improvement in terms. 2014 was another excellent year on all fronts and we expect that 2015 will be even better. Again, thanks to our 80,000 Delta colleagues for their contributions to another successful year. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Paul who will take you through the details on cost and cash flow performance. Paul A. Jacobson : Consistent cost control was again a significant contributor to our 400 basis points of margin expansion this quarter. Total operating expenses increased by $135 million driven entirely by higher profit sharing expenses. We were once again, able to hold non fuel CASM essentially flat in each quarter of 2014 and this quarter marks the sixth consecutive quarter of non-fuel CASM growth below 2% as we are continuing to see the benefits of our upgaging initiatives and lower maintenance expense due to the 50 seat retirements. There is tremendous commitment across the entire organization to continue to achieve our goal of cost growth consistently below 2% and we expect that momentum to continue through this year and into 2016. This year we took delivery of 84 aircraft and retired 89 aircraft which included 60 50 seaters. We improved our operating leverage through upgaging generating 2% higher domestic capacity for the year on 3.9% fewer departures, all while the operational team delivered the lowest maintenance CASM in the industry with the best operational reliability. As we progress through 2015 we will continue to see the benefits from upgaging. The retirement of 50 seaters and older main line aircraft, as well as the benefits of productivity improvements across the organization.  Moving onto fuel, fuel expense declined by $342 million for the quarter, driven by the sharp decline in market fuel prices. Our all in fuel price was $2.62 per gallon which was $0.43 lower year-over-year. Our results this quarter included $180 million in settled hedged losses which were offset by $105 million profit at the refinery. At December 31st we had $925 million in hedge margin posted with counterparties which we suspect will be substantially reduced by June 30 based on current prices. Based on current prices, we are projecting an all in fuel price of $2.45 to $2.50 per gallon for the March quarter. For the full year we are forecasting an all-in price of $2.25 to $2.35 per gallon which is approximately $0.50 to $0.60 lower than 2014. These lower prices should produce over $2 billion in lower fuel expense including hedges. For 2016 we are well positioned for full downside participation should fuel remain at these levels. As I mentioned, the refinery made $105 million profit for the December quarter which represents $151 million improvement versus last year. Lower crude costs combined with higher product crack spreads and increased throughput were key contributors to the refinery\u2019s heightened profitability this quarter. Our already strong cash flow will further benefit from the low fuel price environment which will allow us to continue our progress in strengthening the balance sheet by paying down debt, funding our pension plan, and continuing to return cash to our owners. This year, we generated $5.8 billion of operating cash flow and reinvested $2.1 billion back into the business primarily related to aircraft modifications and purchases of the CRJ 900 and 737 900s which are replacing the 50 seaters and older 757 aircraft. For the March quarter we are projecting $700 million in cap ex primarily related to 737 900 deliveries and deposits on future aircraft. With the $3.7 billion of free cash flow that we generated in 2014, we were able to reduce our adjusted net debt down to $7.3 billion. This reduction in adjusted net debt represents a $2.1 billion decrease compared to the same time last year and delivered $200 million in interest savings year-over-year. We expect another $200 million in interest expense savings in 2015 from continued debt reduction. Additionally, we continued our path of increasing shareholder value by returning $1.35 billion to shareholders through $251 million of dividends and $1.1 billion of share repurchases that retired over 28 million shares for the year.  Moving into 2015 we expect to generate approximately $1 billion of free cash flow during the March quarter. As Ed and Richard mentioned, we will continue to grow free cash flow throughout the year which will go towards completing the $2 billion share repurchase authorization by the end of 2015, a full year ahead of schedule and towards paying down additional debt. We\u2019ll update you in May our further capital deployment plans.  Our long term goals remain at the forefront of how we manage our business. We will continue to prudently reinvest in the business on investments that align with our return on invested capital goal, pay down debt, and return value to our shareholders. In closing, I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to the entire Delta team for a record breaking year. We have a special family here and our performance this quarter and throughout the year are a direct result of the contributions made by each and every one of us. Thanks and I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Jill. Jill Sullivan Greer : That is the wrap up of our prepared remarks. Operator, if you could give the instructions for the analysts to ask their questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from David Fintzen with Barclays Capital. David Fintzen : A quick question on the pilot comments, when you look around the world are there a substantial number of Americans still flying outside of the US? Could this tightness in pilots start to show up not in the US but outside the US as pilots start to come home that would potentially like to? Richard H. Anderson : I don\u2019t know David. My remarks were focused on what the US industry faces today with a pretty significant shortage building in the regional space and that\u2019s exacerbated by the fact that you have, at the majors, a significant wave of retirements over the next decade just because of demographics and it\u2019s pretty much the same at all the carriers so there\u2019s a big pull from the majors, and the 1,500 hour rule is really affecting the ability of the regionals to be able to attract a significant number of new pilots. So, it\u2019s really an effect on the US industry as we see it. David Fintzen : On the infrastructure sort of in place to train pilots as you\u2019re sort of coming through that attrition I mean, is that a limiting factor as well or is there sort of ample training facilities to kind of roll through pilots? Richard H. Anderson : Well, I can speak for Delta. Delta has more than ample training facilities at Delta to run a first rate training operation and I think in the broader industry there is too, the question is the regulatory requirement on 1,500 hours. Operator : Your next question comes from William Greene with Morgan Stanley. William Greene : I think you guys are probably getting this question at lot as well which is I think a lot of investors think about fuel as creating a windfall. I realize you\u2019re going to try to keep as much of it as possible but can you take a little bit about insofar as you start to hit some of these targets sooner than expected, do the priorities you outlined at the investor day in terms of what to do with this cash so if we did get a bit of an extraordinary windfall that wasn\u2019t persistent, how do you think about what to do with that cash? What are the orders of uses in that sense? Richard H. Anderson : Well, I think the first order of use is going to continue to reduce our net debt and the second order of use is going to be higher cash returns for our owners. Now, that\u2019s subject to our Board approval and I\u2019ve got to be careful about not getting to far out there before going through the five year plan. But, our fleet can run at this level of CapEx very easily for a very long period of time on our fleet so we don\u2019t see some big fleet order coming. We think there\u2019s going to be an opportunity for a bunch of used airplanes for us at some point here giving all the NEO deliveries in the narrow body world. We just placed our wide body order, we\u2019re fine on wide bodies so the fleets in good shape and the run rate cap ex that you saw this year, the $2.1, that vicinity is a good run rate because we\u2019ve got to keep our ROIC above that 18% so it\u2019s going to reduce debt and higher shareholder cash returns. William Greene : Then Richard, when you think about fuel and what you should use to underwrite in a five year plan or even a one year plan, what fuel price do you use? I guess where I\u2019m getting at is if fuel were to jump back up do you have to adjust to that or are you really operating at a much higher fuel price so there wouldn\u2019t be a change at Delta even at higher fuel prices? Richard H. Anderson : We actually use pretty high fuel prices in all of our planning and this was a shared experience with Ed and I, we\u2019ve learned this over the years that planning with a low fuel price will only disappoint and planning with a high fuel price if you end up being wrong and the fuel price is lower, you\u2019ll be pleased. But it\u2019s really important when you\u2019re planning an airline over the long term, or making a 30 year MPV decision on buying an airplane to use a very high fuel price otherwise you\u2019re not going to get an ROIC and a free cash flow number that you\u2019re going to like.  Paul, our fuel price for our assumption for our budget was $2\u2026? Paul A. Jacobson : $2.82. Richard H. Anderson : $2.82 even though we knew it was going to be lower. But that way you plan the capacity on a much more muted basis and you make sure that you put the strategies in place to hold yield and RASM. William Greene : So, insofar as fuel went back up you wouldn\u2019t need to make any adjustments I assume, or is that not the right way to think about it? Richard H. Anderson : Well, if fuel goes back up remember, it takes a lot to make a capacity adjustments at an airline of this size. We have 12,000 airplanes so 1% of 12,000 airplanes is 12 airplanes, there\u2019s eight crews per airplane. You\u2019ve got to get all those people hired, and trained, and the flight attendants, and we tend to be on the conservative side, because we don\u2019t want to over shoot on capacity or expense because if you\u2019re adding fixed expense you better be certain you\u2019re going to get a return on it. So, bottom line is it\u2019s always a really conservative approach to how you plan and you should always plan with fuel prices high. We\u2019ve seen this movie many times in the industry and so you\u2019ve got to run the company conservatively and we\u2019re trimming capacity as we speak as we get close into the beginning of the second quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from Tom Kim from Goldman Sachs. Tom Kim : I just wanted to ask with regard to the level of competition out there. Obviously, this industry is always competitive, I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re beginning to see any signs or indication that competition within the domestic market might be increasing at all? Edward H. Bastian : No, we don\u2019t see any signs of that right now. Tom Kim : Then I guess just with Lat Am and the Pacific obviously, you guys have been flagging this very well, I\u2019m curious is this more of a demand side issue, or is it really supply side, or a combination of the two? Then, it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re seeing any signs of inflection in these markets but I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts in terms of whether there is any supply side response largely from the overseas carriers to actually suggest we could see possibly a pleasant surprise with regard to the Lat Am and Pacific markets more specifically? Paul A. Jacobson : If you think about our fourth quarter, four of the five points in Pacific year-over-year decline were based on yen currency. We\u2019ve seen really unprecedented decline in the yen. Despite that, we think that we will be profitable in our Japanese operation in 2015 and so if you think about as we continue to restructure and become less reliant on Japan, we were very pleased with the one point decline which means that there was a lot of core strength in a period of the year. It is not really peak demand. Operator : Your next question comes from Helane Becker \u2013 Cowen & Company. Helane Becker : I thought I heard that you said you were thinking about reducing domestic capacity growth in March and I was just kind of wondering would the thought process there is that that you\u2019re not seeing demand in those markets, or are you concerned about demand in those markets, or what\u2019s the thought behind that? Richard H. Anderson : We\u2019ve been taking a very prudent yield strategy and clearly we have our advanced yields in the domestic network up significantly over the next several months and so as we came through January and saw the actual demand patterns of these higher yields, we took some capacity out. That\u2019s just a normal business process and it doesn\u2019t say anything about core demand. Helane Becker : But do the yields then? Do the yield outlooks say something about the demand outlook? Richard H. Anderson : The yield outlook is very positive and we would like to keep it there and so we\u2019re adjusting the lower demand flights downwards. Edward H. Bastian : Just to be clear, we\u2019re still going to be growing domestic, we\u2019re just reducing some of the growth. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Linenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank. Michael Linenberg : Two questions, just a follow up on Helane\u2019s question Ed, I think the forecast was 3% domestic growth for 2015. If we incorporate the contemplated adjustments at the end of March or starting in March, where does domestic shake out? Is that more closer to 2% for the year? Edward H. Bastian : It\u2019s too early to say, we\u2019re in a calibration. As we have always said, as we get into the year we start to make tactical adjustments. Somewhere in the 2% to 3% range is probably still pretty good guidance. Michael Linenberg : Then just my second question, I believe there\u2019s been a decision made to at least not retire one of the 747s that was going out in the fourth quarter, it looks like it\u2019s going to be back in the schedule starting, I think, in May? How much of the lower fuel price played a factor in that decision, and if it did, are there other sub fleets where maybe it makes sense to fly those aircraft a little bit longer, maybe potentially put back on the order book a bit? Are there opportunities out there or are those decisions not made until you see fuel prices down at this level on a sustained basis? Glen W. Hauenstein : We did retire all the airplanes that we had contemplated. The activation of the 74 was a swap so it was not a net new airplane to the system and we saw the opportunity, which is a great opportunity with our partners at China Eastern, starting in April we will be able to be co-terminus with them. We\u2019ll be able to reduce our MCTs in Shanghai and we had the opportunity between some time it sat in LA and a new maintenance facility we were opening in Shanghai to create the airplane to fly that and that\u2019s really a long term decision that we\u2019ve been waiting for the right opportunity. It was in the five year plan. With the China Visa extensions we see a huge increase in demand and with the opportunity that\u2019s presenting itself in China with our partner China Eastern we really saw this as a onetime opportunity that was not in the normal course of our business, but given the events that had happened with the relaxation of the Visas, given the opportunity we had to relocate, it was really the right time. Michael Linenberg : Anything on that second part of the question? Glen W. Hauenstein : We haven\u2019t changed our fleet plan by one airplane since fuel has come down. So, could you? Yes. Have we? No. Paul A. Jacobson : The total shell count for 2015 will be down about 10 year-on-year. Operator : Your next question comes from Hunter Keay \u2013 Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : I was wondering if I could sort of follow up a little bit on what sort of Bill was asking earlier about this windfall use of cash and where we should think about the incremental cash flow going? Richard, at the analyst day you made a comment about taking net debt down to zero, I know you\u2019ve got to get to five first and you don\u2019t want to talk too far ahead here, but is that the real target or is that sort of a if this current operating environment continues and you guys are generating a lot more cash than you ever thought you would have, that becomes something that is more of a near term realistic possibility or is it kind of let\u2019s just get to five first and see where we are type of thing? Richard H. Anderson : I think it\u2019s a good question. In fact, I think it\u2019s a great question from the long term shareholder perspective because this year we budgeted $3 billion in free cash flow and we got well above that. So, there\u2019s just a natural tendency that it\u2019s going to flow against net debt because we\u2019re pretty disciplined about not wanting to take up our aircraft cap ex and we already have the 50 wide bodies ordered and we\u2019ve got 717, 737, 8321s coming and on the margin they\u2019ll be a few more airplanes as we hit 30 years of age on some of our domestic fleet where we\u2019re going to have to make some purchases but I don\u2019t see the cap ex commitment changing from where we\u2019ve been.  So, there\u2019s two places it ends up going just naturally, one is higher cash returns to our shareholders probably in the form of share buyback and second, is just cash accumulating against net debt. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve said that our target is really zero, we want to get to $5 billion in net debt but the cash is going to accumulate and we\u2019re going to have to be careful to be certain that we steward it wisely for long term owners. Hunter Keay : Glen, can you talk about how you\u2019re strategically managing the inventory on basic economy right now? You highlighted in the prepared remark it was something you were clearly very excited about at the analyst day presentation. Can you talk about how you manage the inventory in terms of not competing against yourself like, if I were to go on Delta.com I was always going to go on Delta.com, how do you manage the risk of me not seeing that basic economy fair right next to a normal fair, if you want to call it that and me buying that? Are you going to restrict the inventory very tightly, are you going to roll it out in a few test markets to see how it goes? Also, how this factors into the OTAs with the full content agreements that you have with them? Glen W. Hauenstein : Really, the basic economy is not a lower fare it\u2019s just the lowest fare we have available. So, if you think about where it\u2019s used today in the 75 markets, it\u2019s primarily used against the ultra-low cost carriers when we have inventory we want to sell and we want customers to buy a competitive product. So, as we think about fares moving forward we want to be less commoditized. We want people to buy the products and services they want and this is really not about lowering fares but allowing people to select what features that Delta offers that they want.  As you know Delta has by far the best industry record for on time performance for baggage and the highest net promotor score of any of the major three carriers so how do we continue to decontent that and continue to offer best in class for whatever customers want to buy from us, and this is really one of those vehicles. Paul A. Jacobson : Just on the OTA question, the OTAs we\u2019ve reduced the number of relationships we have in that distribution channel and in many instances we don\u2019t really have full content agreements so much of this product is really through our website, or through a second point of sale at the airport. The prominence of the OTAs is really diminished particularly as investments in Delta.com have driven very high levels of customer satisfaction. Overall, the OTAs just play a much smaller role in the distribution strategy. Operator : Your next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth \u2013 Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : I appreciate your flattish RASM commentary for the March quarter, I guess 2% growth in total unit revenue. I wonder if you could give a sense for what you expect that to look like by region, or if not by region just maybe what you\u2019d expect domestic to be relative to that flat? Richard H. Anderson : I think the trends you saw in Q4 are probably continuing to take hold in Q1. The international RASMs are being pressured on a continued basis by even an accelerated level of dollar strengthening and domestic is really solid. Our corporate revenues are strong. Current year is kind of off to a very good start in month of January, our corporate revenues in the month of January is up 7% so we see domestic holding up well and we continue to make the adjustments we\u2019ve talked about with some of our international entities. Duane Pfennigwerth : Just on hedging for 2016, I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have to make that decision for you but maybe you could just talk about the thought process, what do you need to see to begin to hedge that out? What is it that you\u2019re looking for that would suggest these prices may be the lowest? Paul A. Jacobson : As we\u2019ve talked about and as we\u2019ve mentioned at investor day, we\u2019ve taken a little bit more of a narrower view in terms of the time versus what we\u2019ve historically looked out at. 2016 is in our radar now. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to jump and do anything extreme, I think we\u2019re going to continue to manage our program as we see it going forward. We have to keep in mind that there is some steepness in the curves so you can\u2019t hedge in the 40s in 2016 and we have to take that into account. That being said, we\u2019re in a position where we could get some good year-over-year improvement. Again, as we see continuing \u201914 to \u201915 and \u201915 to \u201916. All that weighs in but we are committed to our program and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see anything materially different from us. Operator : Your next question comes from Julie Yates \u2013 Credit Suisse. Julie Yates : Just to continue on Duane\u2019s question on unit revenues and maybe just taking a step back and thinking about \u201915, I realize you only give guidance for one quarter but can you give any perspective in light of the changes that are going on in each of the geographies on how we should think about the progression of revenue performance throughout the year and whether we should see improvements maybe from some of the capacity reductions into Asia and the restructuring and the actions on the Trans-Atlantic with Virgin? Richard H. Anderson : I think the domestic entity is going to be solid throughout the year. We see no reason why we\u2019ll see any tail off of our domestic performance. Internationally, as we mature and lap a significant amount of the Latin investment that we\u2019ve made and as we lap the Venezuelan capacity reduction, we should see the Latin unit revenue progression start to improve by the second half of the year. In the Pacific we have talked a lot about the changes we\u2019re making with the 747s. I think it really depends on a currency play with what\u2019s happening with respect to the Yen. In the back half of the year for the Pacific we see some fundamental improvements but that\u2019s factored based on the Yen holding where it\u2019s largely at. Julie Yates : Then just maybe on the Trans-Atlantic? Richard H. Anderson : Our JV with Virgin is going very well. I mentioned that we expect to post a net $200 million profit for the year and our performance in Paris and Amsterdam were also quite strong in Q4. I think our unit revenue performance to those two markets were in the 3% to 5% year-over-year range of improvement and so we would expect 2015 to see continuing strength. Paul A. Jacobson : 2015 in the AFKLM JV we\u2019re expecting significant contribution improvement in the joint venture with Air France KLM. We\u2019re seeing a lot of the fuel price advantage obviously [indiscernible] the long haul. Edward H. Bastian : One last comment just on the global demand scene, we see really good core strength with just one exception and that is Africa, Middle East, and Russia and so we will be adjusting our capacity in those key markets as we move forward through the year. But all kind of different events, Russia being more political, Middle East being related to the oil, and Africa being related to the perception of Ebola because we really don\u2019t fly to Ebola affected areas. Julie Yates : Then lastly, internationally where are you starting to see pressure to remove fuel surcharges? Edward H. Bastian : We never comment on forward pricing initiatives so we\u2019d like to just continue that policy. Operator : Your next question comes from Jamie Baker \u2013 JP Morgan. Jamie Baker : First question as the labor drama played out in recent months at American Airlines, I\u2019m curious if there\u2019s been any impact or sort of change in the tone of dialog between Delta management and its pilots? Does it remain a goal to try and settle before the amendable date and how confident are you that even with new economics you can succeed in keeping the consolidated ex fuel CASM under 2%? Richard H. Anderson : I think the answer to the first question is no change in our great relationship. We have made a commitment with our pilots to finish on time or ahead of schedule and we\u2019re confident we\u2019re going to be able to maintain our cost structure over the long term. Jamie Baker : Ed, I don\u2019t want to get bogged down in semantics, the team seems to be speaking rather enthusiastically today about the impact of lower fuel, but I\u2019m still getting inquiries from investors about that statement in the release about the quote unquote headwinds from lower fuel. Even if you only participate in 50% of the savings, how exactly is that a headwind? Were you just referring to the headwind from the hedge book? Edward H. Bastian : No, there\u2019s no question there\u2019s a correlation as fuel prices come down there\u2019s an industry supply macro that you need to think about so we weren\u2019t talking about any specific headwinds other than the fact that as fuel prices come down you can expect to see some pricing pressure broadly. Paul A. Jacobson : There\u2019s a subpart to that question if you think about the effect of lower fuel prices, it\u2019s affecting some of the economies around the world. It\u2019s a huge boon to the American consumer. There\u2019s never a better time for Americans to go to Europe or to travel around the world. But, when you think about the effect that it has in places like Brazil, Glenn talked about Russia, there are a lot of OPEC economies the cartel was collecting rents that they aren\u2019t collecting anymore and you see it in Venezuela, you see it in a number of carbon producing economies that will have some impact on the foreign point of sale. But, the US it is a huge boon to the US economy. Jamie Baker : If I could just squeeze in a third housekeeping question, I know you reserve the right to modify the profit sharing program, I didn\u2019t see anything in the release to suggest the 2015 break points would be any different, is that correct? Richard H. Anderson : That\u2019s correct. Operator : Your last question comes from Joseph DeNardi \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus. Joseph DeNardi : Paul, I think you were the one that mentioned the pilot retirement wave upcoming over the next couple of years and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve looked at that pretty closely. Is there any way you can quantify what the impact or benefit to your cost structure you expect from that? Richard H. Anderson : It was Richard talking about the pilot staffing constraints and what it takes to grow capacity. I think the normal flow through that we see in the ranks is built into our cost structure and I think we don\u2019t expect that to result in any big unit cost pressures. Joseph DeNardi : I guess wouldn\u2019t it be a tailwind at some point as the retirements start to accelerate? Paul A. Jacobson : Not really, it\u2019s not a seniority based pay per say. There is a little bit of training cost associated with it, but from a wage benefit salary standpoint it\u2019s negligible. Joseph DeNardi : Then just a housekeeping, the first quarter is that PRASM that you expect to be flat or total RASM? Paul A. Jacobson : That\u2019s PRASM. Jill Sullivan Greer : That\u2019s going to conclude the analyst portion of the call. I\u2019m not going to turn it over to Kevin Shinkle, our Chief Communications Officer. Kevin Shinkle : We have about 10 minutes for questions from reporters so please limit yourself to one question and one brief follow up. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jack Nicas \u2013 Wall Street Journal. Jack Nicas : You just were talking about the fact that when you do see significant declines in the price of oil there\u2019s going to be some industry headwinds such as pricing pressures. Can you discuss whether you\u2019re seeing any of that now and if so, can you characterize it a little bit and talk about what it is? Edward H. Bastian : Jack, given the results we just posted with our unit revenues improved and given that we\u2019ve got a flat outlook on a growing supply base into the first quarter 2015, I think that will tell you what we see in the revenue cards. Jack Nicas : Are you seeing at all \u2013 could you say that any competitors are cutting fares or anything like that? Edward H. Bastian : We can\u2019t talk about that. Operator : Your next question comes from David Koenig \u2013 The Associated Press. David Koenig : This may be a bit of a follow up to that, I keep getting the question all of the time when are fares going to go down because fuel is down so sharply and there was no mention of that on the call? There was mention of how you might spend the fuel, if you want to call it, windfall. Anything new that Mr. Anderson, you can say about the impact of fuel on fares? A - Richard H. Anderson : I think we covered it pretty thoroughly there in the call. I think Ed addressed it pretty forthrightly. Over, the cycle you do have some pressure from fuel price and particularly in the foreign point of sale where economies are significantly affected if they had been relying upon oil price payments from the US. David Koenig : Would it take some sort of a drop off in load factors and how much before you might see some difference in fares? Richard H. Anderson : There\u2019s always differences. The marketplace is incredibly competitive and there\u2019s always differences in fares in a competitive marketplace. David Koenig : I guess I meant reductions. Richard H. Anderson : I think we covered it. Operator : Your next question comes from Ted Reed \u2013 The Street. Ted Reed : I would like to hear Glenn explain why you\u2019re adding a flight from Los Angeles to Shanghai given capacity increases in the Pacific and the buildup in Seattle. I would just like to hear why you feel that flight is necessary and how it can make money? A - Glen W. Hauenstein : I thought I just answered that on the analyst side in pretty good detail. The one thing that\u2019s happened in the last few months is the extension of the Chinese Visa program. That was unexpected and so we\u2019ve seen a significant increase from China. The second thing was a long awaited co-terminus move with our partner China Eastern and we\u2019re already connecting about a little less than 200 people a day to Shanghai and points in interior China and starting in April we\u2019ll be able to reduce our minimum connect times and we\u2019ll be able to better connect to those points in China.  So we saw that, the opportunity, combined with the dramatic increase in Chinese visitors and the Chinese economy just came out today and the 73 with the Visas we see really strong demand in China materializing in the second and third quarters. This is something that was in our five year plan we just saw an opportunity to accelerate it given some exogenous events that all seemed to sync up at once. Paul A. Jacobson : Overall Pacific capacity should be down in 2015 about 4%. Ted Reed : That makes even Los Angeles viable for you? Glen W. Hauenstein : Absolutely. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Sasso \u2013 Bloomberg News. Michael Sasso : Yields in Latin American given your rapid growth there over the last year or so? Richard H. Anderson : As we mature that growth and lap that growth we will see certainly some improvements in our overall unit revenue performance. Any time you\u2019re expanding in international markets it generally takes 12 to 24 months before the market starts to fully develop for you and you will see some natural improvements as we temper our capacity additions. The other factor is Venezuela which had an outsized level of unit revenue performance. With the currency changes we decided last year to pull down our frequencies and as we lap that there will also be a benefit to our Latin unit revenues in the second half of this year. Paul A. Jacobson : Just a last comment, on a fairly significant increase in capacity in the fourth quarter absent Venezuela, our yields would have been flat. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeffery Dastin \u2013 Thomas Reuters News. Jeffery Dastin : To clarify Paul\u2019s earlier comment that you will not do anything extreme with the hedge book, does that mean Delta is not looking to lock in lower fuel prices for the long term with new hedge contracts? Paul A. Jacobson : What we do is we manage the book usually inside of an 18 month time horizon but primarily focused inside of about a 12 month period so the comment was intended to mean that we\u2019re just going to continue to look at the program as we\u2019ve been running it. 2016 is coming into view, but we\u2019re not looking to make material changes in how we manage the program. It doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t be hedging in 2016. Operator : Your next question comes from Elliot Blackburn \u2013 Argus Media. Elliot Blackburn : Obviously, the refinery had a good quarter last quarter. I was curious if you guys could talk about what you\u2019re seeing there if the rail, [indiscernible], and crude that you worked to secure, if that\u2019s still competitive there or if you\u2019re finding more opportunities for the waterborne imports at that facility? Paul A. Jacobson : We\u2019ve obviously seen some compression in the spread between domestic and foreign sourced oil which has made foreign a little bit more attractive. But what we\u2019ve seen at the refinery is that crack spreads and margins on products have actually gone up while prices have gone down and that\u2019s contributed to the profitability so we had a great fourth quarter. We expect pretty healthy profit at the refinery in the first quarter as well on the strength of those higher crack spreads which is helping to serve as a bit of a hedge, if you will, on widening spreads on a lower crude price for the airline. Elliot Blackburn : Are you guys expecting to be able to run full out for the year or do you have some planned work at that refinery this year? Paul A. Jacobson : Nothing other than just ordinary maintenance, but there are no planned major shutdowns. Kevin Shinkle : We have time for one more question. Operator : Your last question comes from Edward Russell \u2013 Flight Global. Edward Russell : I wanted to see if you could elaborate a bit on the plans for maintenance facility in Shanghai? Will you be moving any maintenance there from elsewhere and what kind of aircraft will you be maintaining there? Richard H. Anderson : It\u2019s just purely a line maintenance facility so it\u2019s overnight line checks, overnight planned work, just like the line maintenance facility we have in Amsterdam, or Sao Paulo, or Paris, or Tokyo, so it\u2019s not heavy maintenance or engine maintenance. Edward Russell : Approximately what is the expected investment that you plan to make in that facility? Richard H. Anderson : We\u2019re talking about a dozen mechanics and an allotment of spare parts. I think maybe you\u2019re misconstruing the idea of putting line maintenance in Shanghai into being something more than that. It\u2019s 12 people so you could do it out on the ramp, we won\u2019t have a hanger. Kevin Shinkle : Thank you. With that, we conclude our call for today. Thanks everyone for listening.

My name is Sherlon and I will be your coordinator. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Jill Sullivan Greer, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Jill Sullivan Greer : Thanks Sherlon. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. Here in Atlanta today we have Richard Anderson our CEO, Ed Bastian our President, and Paul Jacobson, our CFO, and we have the remainder of the leadership team here in the room with us for Q&A. Richard will open the call, Ed will then address our financial and revenue performance, and Paul will conclude with a review of our cost performance and cash flows. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow up. Today\u2019s discussion does contain forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta\u2019s SEC filings. We\u2019ll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. And you can find the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I will turn the call over to Richard. Richard Anderson : Thanks Jill. This morning we reported the best first quarter in Delta\u2019s history producing solid top line growth, margin expansion and substantial free cash flow. Our pre-tax earnings grew 34% from last year to $594 million despite $300 million from early hedge settlements in the quarter. We earned $0.45 per share versus a consensus of $0.44. We grew our top line revenues by 5%, increased our operating margin by 1.0% to 8.8% and generated a return on invested capital of 22% for the last 12 months. Our strong cash generation continued with 1.1 billion of operating cash flow and north of $500 million of free cash flow in the first quarter. We contributed 900 million to our pension plans, maintained net debt levels of just over $7 billion and returned $500 million to shareholders in dividends and buybacks. We continue to run by far the industry's best operation. In the March quarter we delivered 98.6 completion factor that had a lot of tough weather days in it but we did have 25 days with zero mainline cancellations. Our mainline on-time rate improved 3.1 points to 83.4%. This operational performance is contributing to solid increases in customer satisfaction, we have achieved all time highs in our Net Promoter scores and our customer complain rate has decreased by 23% so far this year. These outstanding results were made possible by the dedication of our employees who work hard everyday to provide an industry leading customer experience and outstanding returns to our shareholders. Looking forward the business on the whole is performing quite well, while the strong dollar is creating a $600 million headwind for our international revenues, it is also a factor in keeping fuel prices down which will contribute over $2 billion in gross savings year-on-year in 2015. We are looking at June quarter operating margins of 16% to 18% up over 200 basis points year-over- year with over $1.5 billion of free cash flow in the June quarter. These record results in cash flow show that the strong dollar is a net positive for Delta. We will use that cash flow to further reduce our debt levels and buyback our stock. These are permanent positive changes to our capital structure. But even with this record level of performance, we have a lot of work left to do to improve our business for our owners. The domestic business is performing very well and demand is solid. Our network and product investments combined with the world class customer service of our employees have widened our domestic revenue premium to the industry which currently stands at 115%. We will continue to be disciplined with our domestic capacity levels, with our domestic growth driven by higher gauge in fewer total airplanes which will cause us to improve efficiency and drive higher operating margins. On the international side, like all U.S. global companies, we are working through volatile currencies around the world. We are taking action to address these issues by reducing our international capacity by 3% year-over-year this winter. This is a six point reduction versus our planned capacity levels. Unlike other U.S. global companies, our margins and profitability will expand in 2015 in the phase of currency volatility because of dramatic fuel cost reductions and top line growth. With flat system capacity for the fourth quarter, we should get our unit revenue growth back on the right trajectory. Cost productivity is a core part of Delta and we've kept our non-fuel CASM growth below 2% for seven consecutive quarters. We have good control of our costs and we continue to drive productivity through domestic upgauging, technology investments and leveraging our scale. The biggest cost opportunity ahead of us is fuel. We restructured our hedge book this quarter which will put the bulk of our hedge losses behind us after this quarter. So starting July 1, we will have significant tailwind for fuel with fuel prices 25% lower than what we will pay in the first half of the year. Over the long-term our focus is on building a durable business model not just through our margin expansion efforts but also by taking risk out of our enterprise, we have the best labor relations in the industry with a strong paper performance culture and a history of working collaboratively with all of our employees. On business risk, we expect considerable time diversifying our revenue streams and building out a geographically balanced network, 15% of our passenger revenues are part of immunized joint ventures and 20% of total revenues from non-ticket sources. Finally, we are reducing our financial risk, we have lowered our fixed cost structure uniquely with our aircraft purchase strategy which gives us the flexibility to quickly make capacity adjustments. We have also substantially strengthened our balance sheet with nearly $10 billion in debt reduction in less than five years. We are only two notches away from investment grade and with another strong year in 2015, we expect to operate Delta with investment grade credit metrics by year end. With a clear path to long-term margin expansion and reduced risk, we get improved earnings predictability and better visibility to the long-term cash generation of this business. We are investing in our future to healthy base of $2 billion to $3 billion annually which is more than sufficient to support our strategies, and this year we expect to generate $4 billion to $5 billion in free cash flow after those investments, less than 10% of the S&P 500 generate free cash flow at this level. In 2015, Delta will once again comfortably exceed our long-term commitments to our owners and despite being one of the top performers in the S&P 500 over the last year, last several years, we believe there is considerable upside in Delta stock. Our free cash flow yield is roughly 12% to 13% compared to the S&P Industrials average of 5% to 6% and our PE multiple is at roughly half the level of this peer group. We are working through our updated long-term plan now. We'll take the plan to our Board at the end of this month. Part of that work includes developing the next set of metrics that will guide the business including the optimal long-term debt target and level of shareholder returns for the company. We believe this plan will give long-term equity holders very clear guidance on our future and what they can expect from our cash flows and it will show that Delta has earned a place among the top tier S&P 100 companies. We look forward to sharing those plans with you in mid-May. With that I'll turn the call over to Mr. Bastian and Mr. Jacobson. Edward Bastian : Thank you, Mr. Anderson, and good morning, everyone. We delivered a record March quarter with pretax income increasing over 30% to $594 million, despite a $300 million early hedge settlement. Our net income was $372 million or $0.45 per share versus consensus of $0.44. We expanded our operating margin by a point to 8.8% which includes the impact of the early out of quarter hedge settlements, which cost us roughly three points of margin. These results are in line with the initial margin guide we gave in January. The quarter was obviously impacted by our $1.1 billion in hedge losses, thus to give you a better sense of the core performance of the business. End market fuel prices our margin for the quarter is 17.8% among the best in the industry and provides a good go-forward perspective on our margin expectations given our hedge losses will be largely behind us as of July 1. I want to thank the great Delta people for their dedication and determination that made these record results possible. We continue to grow the topline which will be up 5% to $9.4 billion against a back drop of roughly 45% in lower market fuel prices and $105 million in currency headwinds. Corporate revenues increased 3% despite pressure from currencies, with strength in the Trans-Atlantic driven by our joint venture with Virgin Atlantic and from the financial services industry both up double-digits in the March quarter. Our recent survey shows corporate travel managers continue to be optimistic about the remainder of the year with roughly 85% of respondents anticipating they will maintain or increase spending over the balance of this year. We also saw good traction with our ancillary revenues. Merchandising revenues including branded fares, first-class upsell and preferred seating grew by 27% and contributed an incremental $50 million to our top-line this quarter. However, the strong dollar and lower international surcharges are causing our revenue performance to fall short of expectations. As Richard mentioned, we are taking action with our winter capacity plans to address these issues which I'll give details on in just a few minutes. First, on the March quarter. Passenger unit revenues declined 1.7% driven by 1.5 points of currency effect. However, the underlying demand environment is stronger than the RASM optics would suggest. In fact on a currency neutral basis, unit revenues were essentially flat with last year's levels. Our domestic performance remains solid with RASM flat on 5% higher capacity. And as a reminder, two of those capacity points were caused by the first quarter 14 winter storm cancellations which created one point of RASM benefit that we had to overcome this year. Our Seattle expansion is performing well with domestic unit revenues up 2% on 55% higher capacity. We also saw strength in our JFK long haul markets, especially the Transcons as we continue to make corporate gains in New York and Los Angeles. Our hub to hub markets also performed well with 4% RASM gains. In the Trans-Atlantic, unit revenues declined 3% driven entirely by a three point currency headwind on four points of higher capacity. Strength in core Europe and London offset headwinds in Africa, the Middle East and Russia which pressured entity unit revenues by more than two points. To give perspective, these markets collectively saw unit revenue declines up 15% despite 10% capacity reductions. We're pleased with the performance of our two Trans-Atlantic joint ventures. This quarter as these relationships with Air France, KLM, and Virgin Atlantic allowed us to expand margins despite significant currency pressure on the euro and pound. In Latin America, unit revenues declined 4% on 13% higher capacity. The entirety of the decline was driven by currency and pressure from last year's Venezuela in capacity reductions. Our partners GOL and AeroMexico contributed $33 million in incremental revenues this quarter and we have more opportunity to expand these relationships. Along with AeroMexico, we\u2019ve filed an application for anti-trust immunity for a new $1.5 billion joint venture between the U.S. and Mexico. This is a significant opportunity that expands options for customers to the largest market in Latin America. We face our toughest revenue environment in the Pacific where unit revenues declined 9% with roughly seven points of the decline driven by foreign exchange. Specifically, the Yen revenue headwind in the quarter was $40 million net of hedges. For the remainder of 2015, our Yen hedges are valued at about $110 million. Now looking forward to the June quarter, we are forecasting total revenues to increase about 2% with RASM down 2% to 4% on 3% higher capacity. About three points of that RASM decline is attributable to currency and international surcharge declines. It is also important to note that we are lapping a very strong Q2 2014 performance in which we grew system RASM at 6% which is the toughest comp we'll face this year. Our summer revenue performance combined with significantly lower fuel prices and continued strong cost controls should result in another record profit with second quarter operating margin of 16% to 18% up two points year-on-year. Excluding hedges our second quarter margins are expected to be north of 20%. Domestically, the demand environment remains stable and we expect unit revenues to be roughly flat this quarter on 3% to 4% more capacity. This is consistent with the performance we saw in March of what we're already seeing in April. We expect international RASM to be down in the high single digits in Q2 with five points of impact from currency. In addition to currency, we're also continuing to experience softer demand trades in certain markets including Brazil, Russia, the Middle East and Africa. However, revenue headwinds from currency will be more than offset by cost reductions and fuel price declines. Cash flow and margin performance in the international entities will be at record levels this summer. Post Labor Day, we will reduce our planned international capacity by six points resulting in a 3% year-on-year reduction to get our RASM performance back to better levels for the winter. This reduction will be a key component to achieve the pricing improvements necessary to drive longer term sustainable margin expansion. In the Trans-Atlantic, we'll reduce our planned capacity levels by five points resulting in a 0% to 2% capacity decline for the fourth quarter. The biggest adjustments will be in Africa, India and the Middle-East which will see a reduction of 15% to 20%. In addition, we will suspend service to Moscow for the winter season. In Latin America, our network investment tails-off later this year with capacity growth less than 2% by the fourth quarter. To address the RASM pressure, we've seen from the devaluation of the Real, we'll reduce capacity to Brazil by about 15%. We'll also make adjustments to longer haul ethnic markets that are highly reliant on foreign point of sale traffic. These capacity adjustments along with lapping the impact of last year's capacity reductions in Venezuela should drive a better unit revenue result. Pacific will take longer to show improvement as we take the next steps in our network restructuring there. Through gauge reductions, we'll take another 15% to 20% of capacity out of Japan including a 25% reduction in our intra-Asia and beach lines since those markets have been significantly impacted by the devaluation of the Yen. These capacity reductions will be achieved through down-gauging which will allow us to retire six more 747's by the end of the year. In total, our Pacific capacity will decline 10% in the fourth quarter. We should have good margin and cash flow performance through the seasonally strong second and third quarters. Once the peak summer season ends, we are moving quickly on our capacity actions which will continue to drive momentum in the business. Now, I'll turn the call over to Paul to go through the details on cost and cash flow. Paul Jacobson : Thank you, Ed. Strong cost control is a highlight again this quarter and was a key driver of our strong margin expansion we realized before early hedge settlements. Total operating expenses increased by $356 million driven largely by higher volumes and investments in our product and people, as well as by higher profit-sharing expense which was up 40% versus last year. Non-fuel CASM declined 1.4% on a 5% capacity increase driven by up-gauging initiatives, lower maintenance expense due to the 50 seat retirements and other productivity improvement efforts. FX also benefited non-fuel CASM by about a point. Moving on to fuel. Our total fuel expense increased slightly as lower market prices were offset by higher consumption at our hedge losses. Our all-in fuel price was $2.93 per gallon down from $3.03 in the same period last year. The early settlements added about $0.33 per gallon for the quarter. The refinery made an $86 million profit this quarter versus a $41 million loss in the same period last year. The improvement was driven by lower group costs driven by an increase in North American consumption, a continued favorable crack spread environment and increased throughput. Over the last four quarters, the refinery has produced a cumulative profit of over $220 million. We expect that to continue to build in 2Q with a projected profit of approximately $80 million. As Richard mentioned and as we disclosed previously, we took steps in the first quarter to restructure our second half 2015 hedge book in order to balance our exposure while still retaining some level of longer term upside protection. In February, we took an advantage of the 20% spike in forward curves to settle about a third of our second half 2015 hedges for approximately $300 million. We also extended a similar portion of our exposure out of the back half of 2015 and into 2016. While the second quarter will have approximately $650 million in hedge losses, the average price per gallon will be significantly lower than what we realized in Q1. Specifically, we are projecting an all-in fuel price of $2.35 to $2.40 per gallon for the June quarter. For the June quarter, we are approximately 40% hedged against an increase in prices but have nearly full downside participation of about 90% all the way down to Brent prices of $40 a barrel. For the second half of the year, given the hedge book restructuring, we expect our fuel price per gallon to be consistent with the industry average. We have a total of about $300 million in hedge losses for the second half and 90% to 95% downside participation to a Brent price of approximately $40 a barrel. This will equate to roughly 25% lower price per gallon for Delta in the second half relative to the first. For the second half of the year, we expect our all-in fuel price to be in the range of $2 and $2.05 per gallon which is approximately $0.70 to $0.75 lower than 2014. Overall, we continue to expect fuel costs to be an enormous tailwind and provide a net benefit of $2.2 billion for Delta for the year. We are also well positioned to benefit of fuel remains at these levels in 2016. As a result, our already strong cash flow will continue to grow which will allow us to further strengthen the balance sheet by paying down debt, fund our pension plans, and return cash to shareholders in 2015 and beyond. For the March quarter, we generated more than $1 billion of operating cash flow, net of $900 million in pension contributions. This compares to $605 million of pension contributions in last year's March quarter. We subsequently made substantially all of the remaining 2015 contributions for a total of $1.2 billion for the year. We also reinvested roughly $600 million back into the business primarily related to aircraft modifications and the purchases required for our domestic re-fleeting. For the June quarter, we are projecting $1 billion in capital expenditures primarily related to 737-900 and A330 deliveries, as we continue to reinvest in the business for the long term. With more than $500 million of free cash flow we generated during the March quarter, we continued our path of increasing shareholder capital returns with $75 million of dividends and $425 million of share repurchases. To date, we have completed $1.3 billion of our existing $2 billion authorization. Adjusted net debt at the end of the quarter was $7.4 billion and our debt reduction lowered interest expense by $55 million for the quarter. We continue to expect strong free cash flow generation going forward and remain committed to a capital allocation strategy that drives value for our shareholders. We look forward to updating you on our longer term capital deployment plan in May. In closing, I'd like to once again thank the entire Delta team for another record breaking quarter. We have the best employees in the industry and our performance is driven by their contributions. Thanks. And with that, I'll turn it back to Jill. Jill Sullivan Greer : Thanks, Paul.

And with that, I will turn the call over to Richard. Richard Anderson : Thanks Jill. This morning we reported another record quarterly result. We maintained our revenue base despite an 18% decline in fuel prices, which allowed us to expand our pre-tax margin by 200 basis points, improving earnings per share by 22% year-on-year and generated free cash flow of $1.6 billion in the quarter. We also delivered a return on invested capital of 23.5% for the last 12 months. We benefited from lower fuel expense in the quarter despite a $600 million hedge loss. Excluding the impact of hedges our operating margin would have expanded nearly 700 basis points to more than 21%. As of July 1, the fuel hedge headwind we have faced over the last six months is behind us and we expect the fuel price we will pay in the second half to be in line with the industry. Our strong cash generation continued with $2.5 billion of operating cash flow and $1.6 billion of free cash flow for the quarter. This allowed us to accelerate returns to our owners with $1 billion in dividends and share buybacks while also reducing our adjusted net debt by another $250 million to $7.1 billion. We continue to run the industry's best operation by far. In the June quarter, we delivered 99.8% completion factor including 43 days with zero mainline cancelations. Our mainline on time rate improved two points to 85.3. None of our global or national competitors are even close to this level of performance. These outstanding results were made possible by the dedication of our employees who work extremely hard every day to provide an industry-leading customer experience and outstanding returns to our owners. Regarding the current environment, business conditions generally remain favorable, currency volatility continues to impact our international business while domestic yields have been under pretty significant pressure. Despite these headwinds the result we reported this morning marks the best June quarter in our history. We still have great momentum in the business and we expect to report record earnings again in the third quarter. Specifically, we're forecasting EPS growth in 3Q of well over 30%, operating margins of 19% to 21% and $1.9 billion of operating cash flow in the September quarter. We will use that cash flow to reinvest in the business, reduce our debt, return cash to our owners, all of which will be consistent with the capital deployment plan we provided to the marketplace last May. Last week we announced a strategic investment in GOL that will play a key role and helping us achieve our long term goals. Ed will provide specifics, but I\u2019d highlight that building out our Latin network is a major initiative for Delta. Our stake in GOL will further this effort as the largest domestic carrier in Brazil and it will provide significant long term upside in the region for Delta particularly as we move toward open skies with Brazil, when we couple our investment in GOL with the significant investment we have in AeroMexico we have the foundation for the strongest network in Latin America. We have a long and successful history with our partner Air France KLM that has allowed us to build a very profitable Trans-Atlantic business that coupled with our Virgin Atlantic investment will allow us to continue to leverage that kind of model with new partners in other markets and regions of the world. I also want to comment on our fourth quarter capacity outlook. Margin expansion is a key component of the long term plan at Delta and adjusting Delta supply to meet market base demand is necessary to drive margin growth and to hit our long term financial targets. We're currently benefiting from lower fuel prices. We do not believe margin expansion driven largely by declining fuel prices is sustainable over the long term and our plan assumes raising fuel prices over time. Because of this, RASM growth is a necessary component of our business strategy over time and we will unilaterally determine Delta\u2019s capacity at levels consistent with achieving our long term goals. Much like consumer retail our store sales must be positive year-over-year over the long term. For the fourth quarter, our domestic growth will be 2%. As we announced last April international capacity will be down 3.5% in 4Q. This is slightly larger change then we announced last April. This reduction in international capacity is driven by currencies and economic weaknesses in certain countries around the world. These actions will result in system capacity being consistent with last year\u2019s levels and in line with current demand expectations which we expect will get to unit revenue to be roughly flat by year end. Lastly regarding the recent pilot vote, we were disappointed our pilots turned down an agreement that would have improved upon their already industry-leading contract. However, this outcome doesn\u2019t mark any change to the strong working relationship we have with our pilots who are leaders in our operation and key stakeholders in the enterprise. We will continue to work together with them to find common solutions. We\u2019ve been doing this quite well for the last decade and I have confidence that we'll continue to do so in the future. Operating our business with a long-term perspective has proven very beneficial for Delta\u2019s customers, employees and share owners. We\u2019ve been able to invest in our employees through wage increases, healthy profit sharing and job growth for our customers. We run absolutely the best operation in the world. We\u2019ve improved our products, technologies, operations and service with nearly $10 billion in capital investment in the last five years. And for owner, we\u2019ve returned over $3 billion in the last two years while improving the strength of our balance sheet with over $10 billion of debt reduction and we\u2019ve increased our market capitalization to over $30 billion. We have a lot of upside in the business. We can do more in the future as we continue to execute on our plan the way we have consistently executed over the last decade. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ed and Paul to go through the details of the quarter. Thank you. Ed Bastian : Thanks Richard. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We delivered a record June quarter with pretax income increasing 14% to $1.64 billion. Our net income was slightly north of $1 billion or $1.27 per share, $0.06 higher than consensus. We expanded our operating margin 1.7 points to 16.8%, which is in line with our initial guidance range for the quarter of 16% to 18%. I\u2019d like to thank Delta employees for their contributions to another record result, which we are pleased to recognize with an additional $411 million contribution to next year\u2019s profit sharing payoff. We\u2019re able to grow our topline slightly as the number of our revenue initiatives and non-passenger revenue sources help to offset a $116 million foreign exchange headwind. Corporate demand remains solid with volume growth of 3% in the quarter while that was largely offset by fare pressure. We continue to see good performance with our branded fares initiative. Total merchandizing revenues and fees grew by 11% led by incremental first-class revenue growth of 17% and comfort plus growth of nearly 30%. We increased our paid first-class load factor to 57% out eight points year-over-year on a base of 7% more first-class seats. Our enhanced agreement with American Express produced an incremental $60 million in revenue this quarter. Our partnership with AmEx remained strong. Despite these improvements the strong dollar and lower fuel surcharges remained headwinds for international business while softer yields in certain domestic markets resulted in revenues that fell short of our initial expectations. For the June quarter, passenger unit revenues declined 4.6% with 2.5 points attributable to currency and lower surcharges and the remainder attributable to lower domestic yields. This yield weakness domestically was limited to a small group of markets. In fact, three markets accounted for 50% of the overall domestic yield weakness. Despite these pressures, we're able to expand our domestic revenue premium to the industry, which now stands at 115% year-to-date. Margins did expand across all our domestic hubs in the quarter and excluding the effect of our fuel hedge losses achieved a 23% domestic margin up 800 basis points relative to last year. Relative to some of our growth initiatives, Seattle performed well absorbing 35% higher capacity while maintaining RASM levels. We\u2019re also pleased with the performance of our JFK long-haul markets especially the LAX in San Francisco Transcons that we announced late last month that we'll be adding additional and upgraded service as United exits JFK. In the Trans-Atlantic, unit revenues declined 11.5% with over six points of impact from currency and fuel surcharges. We faced a tough comp in the region this quarter as Trans-Atlantic unit revenue improved by more than seven points last year. In core European markets, we saw improved U.S. point-of-sale demand, but this was more than offset by a reduced point-of-sale demand in Europe and the effect of the weaker Euro. While we continue to face headwinds in Africa, the Middle East and Russia, we're seeing some positive signs in places like Johannesburg. We continue to make capacity adjustments in these challenging markets including the suspension of service to Moscow for the upcoming winter season. We're pleased with the performance of our two Trans-Atlantic joint ventures this quarter as these relationships through the Air France, KLM and Virgin Atlantic saw margins expand once again despite continued currency pressure. We\u2019re using the success of these joint ventures as the model as we deepen our partnerships with carriers in other parts of the world. In Latin America, unit revenues were down eight points on 8% higher capacity. This decline was driven by currency and pressure from last year\u2019s Venezuelan capacity reductions. This quarter marks the last of our high single-digit growth in Latin America as we\u2019ve largely finished building out that portion of our network. Going forward, our capacity growth in the region will return to levels more consistent with the system average. Our partner's GOL and AeroMexico contributed $25 million in incremental revenue this quarter and we're taking advantage of the opportunity to expand upon these relationships. As Richard highlighted, we will be increasing our equity investment in GOL by up to $56 million as part of larger rights offering, which will result in Delta potentially increasing our position up to 9%. At the same time, we will be guaranteeing $300 million of unsecured debt to be entered into by GOL. That guarantee will be secured by GOL\u2019s interest in Smiles, the company\u2019s publicly traded loyalty program. This will raise GOL\u2019s cash position to a level that ensures that carrier will have ample liquidity in the difficult economic environment in Brazil. Adjusted for these initiatives, GOL would have ended its second quarter with $1.1 billion in liquidity, 35% of their annual revenues. We feel great about our long-term prospects with GOL and are pleased to stand behind the company and the work Kakinoff and his team are doing to address these challenges. As part of the transaction we\u2019ll extend our exclusive commercial partnership with the target of getting to a joint venture with GOL as Open Skies with Brazil becomes effective later this year. When combined with a joint venture that we have planned with AeroMexico would involve immunized alliances in two of the two largest aviation markets in Latin America. In the Pacific, the revenue environment remains challenging with the unit revenues down 8.5% on 4% lower capacity and roughly 12 points of impact from FX and fuel surcharges. Specifically, the Yen revenue headwind in the quarter was $27 million net of hedges. As we\u2019ve laid out previously, restructuring our Pacific network is one of our biggest opportunities for margin improvement going forward and the early results of these efforts are positive. As part of these efforts, we\u2019ll be reducing our winter capacity into Pacific by 6% to 8% including retiring six of the 747s and cancelling the loss making Seattle Canada service. And now looking forward to the September quarter guidance, we expect the revenue environment across the system to remain under pressure and we\u2019re forecasting total revenue to decline slightly from prior year levels with RASM down 4.5% to 6.5% on three points of higher capacity. The quarter will be a bit choppy with the July and September months posting better results than August. However we\u2019re expecting fuel expense to be a $1 billion lower year-over-year, which will more than offset this revenue weakness to result in another record profit with an operating margin of 19% to 21% of more than 400 points year-on-year. As Richard, mentioned the right balance of supply and demand in the business is key to achieving positive unit revenues over the long-term. This is a fundamental component of our plan and the financial targets we outlined at our capital meeting in May. Based on the current environment we believe that our previously announced capacity plans are still at the appropriate levels for this winter. As such, we\u2019re planning for 2% growth domestically and a 3.5% reduction internationally, which is a 50 basis point further reduction from what we previously announced, which will result in overall system capacity being flat year-over-year in the fourth quarter. We believe this plan is in line with current demand and GDP forecast and it will allow us to get our unit revenue back on the right trajectory with our goal to be flat by the end of the year. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Paul, to go through the details on cost and cash flows. Paul Jacobson : Thanks Ed and good morning, everyone. Consistent cost of execution continued again in this quarter and was a key contributor to the 160 basis points of operating margin expansion relative to last year. Total operating expenses were $85 million lower as the decline in fuel cost offset the investments we\u2019re making in our product as well as $71 million in higher profit sharing expense. Non-fuel CASM declined under a point on a 3.4% capacity increase. This performance was slightly better than guidance as a result of some favorability and one-time benefits that occurred during the close process. This marks the eight consecutive quarter of non-fuel CASM growth below 2% and the sixth consecutive below 1%. As is evident in this result, the entire Delta organization is highly focused on controlling cost. Our updating progress, maintenance initiatives and other productivity improvement efforts were the key drivers of this strong cost performance. As an example, since 2010 in the domestic entity we've increased capacity approximately 1.2% per year, but that\u2019s been on 13% total fewer departures and 9% total fewer aircraft over that time. FX also benefited non-fuel CASM by about a point. We expect non-fuel CASM to be flat in the September quarter as our cost reduction initiatives continue to keep our performance below our 2% growth target. Moving on to fuel, our total fuel expense declined 16% as lower market fuel prices more than offset higher consumption and our hedge losses. Our all-in fuel price was $2.40 per gallon down from $2.93 in the same period last year. Hedge losses were at $0.58 per gallon headwind in the quarter. The refinery made a $90 million profit this quarter versus a $13 million profit the same period last year driven by lower crude cost and improved mix of North American supply. A continued favorable crack spread environment and increased throughput also contributed to the refinery's profit. Over the last four quarters the refinery has produced a cumulative profit of $300 million. We expect that trend to continue to build in 3Q with a projected profit of approximately $60 million. With the recent sharp drop in fuel prices, we currently expect our September quarter fuel expense will be $1 billion lower year-over-year, net of roughly $200 million of hedge losses. At $1.90 to $1.95 per gallon, our second half fuel price will be 28% lower than what we paid in the first half of 2015 according to the current curve. We expect this price will be in line with the industry average for the balance of the year. For the remainder of the year, we\u2019re approximately 15% hedged against an increase in prices with approximately 85% downside participation to Brent prices of $40 per barrel. Overall, we continue to expect fuel cost to be an enormous tailwind and provide a net benefit of more than $2 billion for Delta this year. We\u2019re also well positioned to benefit if fuel remains at these levels for 2016. Our already strong cash flow will continue to benefit from these lower fuel prices, which will allow us to return cash to our owners, while also further strengthening the balance sheet by paying down debt and funding our pension plans. For the June quarter, we generated $2.5 billion of operating cash flow net of $300 million in pension contributions. At this point we\u2019ve made all of our planned 2015 contributions for a total of $1.2 billion. We also reinvested $900 million back into the business primarily related to 737, 900 and A330 deliveries as we continue our long-term focus. For the September quarter, we\u2019re projecting roughly $800 million in capital expenditures. With the $1.6 billion of free cash flow we generated during the June quarter, we continued our tap that we said out in May of increasing shareholder returns with $72 million of dividends and 925 million of share repurchases during the quarter. We completed all that remained under our $2 billion authorization from 2014 as we had planned. We also opportunistically repurchased an additional $200 million under our new $5 billion authorization as we took advantage of share price weakness during the quarter. In addition we repurchased another $50 million in just the first two weeks of July. We expect to return nearly $2.5 billion to shareholders this year consistent with our goal of returning at least 50% of free cash flow through dividends and buybacks. Adjusted net debt at the end of the quarter was $7.1 billion and our debt reduction lowered interest expense by nearly $50 million for the quarter relative to last year. Our goal is to achieve and maintain $4 billion in adjusted net debt levels by 2017 and we\u2019re on track to do so. The improvements in our balance sheet were recently recognized with a credit upgrade from Moody's, which now has Delta two notches away from investment grade alongside the other agencies. In closing, I\u2019d like to thank the entire Delta team for another record-breaking quarter, in fact our ninth consecutive. We have the best employees in the industry and our performance is driven by your contributions. Thank you. Jill? Jill Sullivan Greer : Lauren, we're now ready for questions from the analysts if you could give everybody instructions on how to get in the queue. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Jamie Baker : Hey, good morning team. First question for Richard, I wouldn\u2019t expect you to comment on the legal merits of the DOJ\u2019s recent inquiry, but I am curious in your mind in a worst case scenario, if you can envision an outcome that would impair your current level of transparency? Richard Anderson : I don\u2019t really think I want to comment on any of that Jamie. Jamie Baker : Okay. All right. Richard Anderson : But I think that we\u2019re going to always be transparent with our investors. I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any legal prohibition on being transparent unilaterally that is with our investors. And if you think about the data that\u2019s available on airlines, our schedules are public. We\u2019re filed in OAG and ATP Carro and under DOT regulations we're required to file huge amounts of data with the government in addition to all the public data that\u2019s made available through the GDS Systems. So bottom line is we\u2019re going to continue to comply with the law, act unilaterally and do our best to give our investors visibility into our business. Jamie Baker : Excellent, I appreciate it. And the follow-up, since you brought up the topic Richard to the pilots, rather than just rely on my contacts or trolling the message boards, what are the three or four biggest reasons in your mind that the PA was rejected by a fairly wide margin? Was it noise around the sick leave issue, changes around JV flying and how Virgin got treated? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for what portions of the drawing board you might need to return to as opposed to just pay rates or something like that? Richard Anderson : I think it\u2019s premature to do that. The Delta Master Executive Council is going to be meeting in a couple of weeks and we really need to hear back from them. I think the overarching story is that we have an incredible track record with them and if you think about it, we\u2019re still five months ahead of the amendable day. So bottom line is the relationship is still strong. It\u2019s intact. We have a decade history of being able to work well together and we\u2019re still operating on both sides in that same spirit. Jamie Baker : Got it. I appreciate the answers Richard, take care. Safe travels. Richard Anderson : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Michael Linenberg : Yes hey, two questions here Ed. I want to go back to Trans-Atlantic, I think you talked about fuel surcharges and currency weakness and accounting from six points of the 11.5% decline and then I know you also had a difficult comp. What sort of component or as it relates to connecting flows and how that number builds up, what are you seeing on just your connecting traffic to your partners as we see a lot of capacity getting added into the marketplace? Is that also driving that number down or putting pressure on that -- on the Trans-Atlantic PRASM? Glen Hauenstein : Mike, its Glen. Michael Linenberg : Hi Glen. Glen Hauenstein : One of the things that our great relationship with Air France scale I mean now Virgin, allows us to do is to do contract during periods of lower economic growth and route that traffic over the European hubs in Amsterdam in London. So what you see with us for example as we reduce our capacity into Russia because of the weakness in the demand to Russia, we expect to generate a significant or retain a significant amount of that over those hubs and so as we work our way through this situation with the lower Euro and the lower European demand, we actually would increase -- we would expect to increase our connecting traffic over our European hubs. Michael Linenberg : Yes I am just -- but I\u2019m wondering Glen are you seeing some displacement of that traffic to competitors such as Emirates or Etihad or Qatar as they continue to add more and more seats into the marketplace? And I\u2019m looking more like U.S. into India, Middle East, Africa because there is a decent amount of flow traffic between you and your partners. Glen Hauenstein : Correct. As we\u2019ve stated in the past, we are not -- we have not been the largest player in the U.S. to India or the Indian Subcontinent but it is a significant long-term threat to us. As much a missed opportunity, we believe that under the right and clear circumstances that we should be able to fly non-stop from the U.S. into India. Michael Linenberg : Okay. Great and then just quick one monthly PRASM, is this -- was June the last month or are you going to continue to provide that? Ed Bastian : We\u2019re going to continue to provide it for the time being. Michael Linenberg : Great, thanks Ed. Operator : Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thanks. Good morning. Appreciate your commentary on the small number of markets that drove yield weakness in the U.S. I wonder, one, did you comment on what you think domestic unit revenue will be in that third quarter guidance? And then with respect to those weaker markets, are you detecting any firming or how is your maybe forecasting approach changed with respect to those smaller but weaker markets? Ed Bastian : Duane, we did not disclose our domestic unit revenue expectations for the third quarter, but what I can tell you is that we have embedded within our third quarter overall unit revenue guide the expectation that through the summer that domestic weakness is going to remain. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay. Thanks. And then just on the branded fares, can you expand a little bit about what\u2019s driving that $56 million and how you define whether or not that that\u2019s incremental. Ed Bastian : Well, our three really branded fares that we're talking about today, one is basic economy, which is our spirit match fare if you will or ultra low cost carrier which is a de-comp dented product. We have Comfort Plus, which we re-launched in the quarter with a few additional amenities and we saw a huge uptick now. We believe this is all incremental because the transaction is actually a post purchase transaction. So you have to go in and buy the additional service upgrade after you purchased your ticket and so we view that as fully incremental. And then first-class up-sell is really the amount of incremental seats that we\u2019ve sold net of the cost of or the displacement of the coach fares that were upgraded from. So achieving a 57% paid load factor in first class is another stepping stone along our path. I believe when we started, we told our investors that we file this as a several billion dollar opportunity in total with all four of these classes intact or three of the classes intact in the main cabin and so 70% is our long-term goal. We\u2019re at 57 today and we started at 13. So we\u2019ve made quite a bit of progress in the last several years on that front and we\u2019re very pleased with the results in all of our product lines. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Julie Yates with Credit Suisse. Julie Yates : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First just a clarification on commentary. It sounds like you're now saying the goal is to achieve flat unit revenues by the end of the year and I believe at the risk of getting too granular here that at a conference in June you cited that the company would be on a past to get to positive unit revenue by the end of year. So am I reading too much into that or is there slight shift here? Richard Anderson : There is a no shift in that Julie. Our plan is and our goal is to get there by the end of the year and we would like to get to positive. But we got to get to flat before we get to positive right. Julie Yates : Makes sense. Okay. And then just a quick one on buyback. So clearly the market is not ascribing the same value to fuel driven earnings versus PRASM driven earnings. And so on the scenario which if fuel stay below $2 in the market continues to undervalue your stock with a PE multiple sub ten times, how do we think about the sustainability of the nearly $1 billion buyback we saw in the second quarter? Paul Jacobson : Julie, good morning. This is Paul. Clearly as we articulated back in June, we have taken the opportunity given these low prices to accelerate the buyback a little bit. Part of our long term goals is what we\u2019ve talked about is returning at least 50% of cash to shareholders in a balanced fashion. So we don\u2019t have any comment on what our pace is going to be in the second half of the year. But we need to continue to make progress against all of our goals that we outlined in May. Julie Yates : Understood. Thank you, Paul. Operator : Our next question comes from David Fintzen with Barclays. David Fintzen : Hey, good morning, everyone. For steadying the supply and the demand and getting that right into here and can you just talk a little bit about what\u2019s embedded in kind of your domestic demand assumption? Is it some of that weakness we\u2019ve seen lately for our stabilizes improve? Just kind of how are you really starting to think about the end of the year? Glen Hauenstein : Hi, this is Glen Hauenstein. So I think as you look at where the weakness is, it is not in corporate demand. It is in the yield that we\u2019re obtaining from corporate demand. And so as we continue to move forward, we don\u2019t talk about future pricing initiatives we never have and so -- but I would say is I think that corporate demand remains very, very strong and very, very strong even out of the cities that have had this yield impact and how the industry reacts will determine how those three cities do. David Fintzen : Okay. Okay, appreciate that and then just quietly bigger picture, for getting that kind of record earnings on lower fuel, lower RASM, does that start to change some of the -- through return on investment on some of the density as of the up-gauging? Does that kind just mitigate some of the speed of up-gauging regional etcetera, or is that still sort of ahead and sort of incremental opportunities. Richard Anderson : Let me take this. Where the up-gauging strategy is an important -- continuing important part of our fleet strategy because no matter what, operating the fleet more efficiently makes good sense from a margin standpoint. And so when we up-gauge 50-seater to a 76-seater or a 76-seater to a 100-seater and all the way up the line, we\u2019re still going to be able to operate a larger number of ASMs with a fewer number of shelves in that kind of efficiency. If you just think about it from a factory standpoint, we\u2019re running our factories much more efficiently and you\u2019ll always invest in efficiency in an industrial business. David Fintzen : Okay, I appreciate that. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Darryl Genovesi : Hi good morning guys. Paul does the CASM ex-fuel guidance for the third quarter contemplate any deal with the pilot tap-ins that actually impacts the third quarter? Paul Jacobson : We never those -- we never project future labor deals in our cost guidance. Darryl Genovesi : Okay. And then on I guess on pension discount rates seem to be up about 50 basis points year-to-date. Could you guys just give us say an update on where the pension expense and the deficit is projected at this point? Paul Jacobson : Sure Darryl, Paul. The sensitivity on the underfunded pension plan is about a $1.5 billion for every 50 basis points. So we would expect to see obviously some goodness on the liability there. The rate isn\u2019t as sensitive on expense, but as we continue to fund above the minimum contributions we should see some expense going here as well. Darryl Genovesi : Thanks and then if I could just squeeze one last one in, on the American Express deal, you laid out at the Investor Day a plan to essentially double our revenue stream over the next four, five years. Can you give us a sense of how much of that incremental revenue should drop due to earnings? Paul Jacobson : I would anticipate we haven\u2019t publicly disclosed what the deal or the margin performance of that is, but there is a high contribution margin associated with the improved AmEx economics. Darryl Genovesi : Okay. Great. Thanks very much guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Andrew Didora : Hi, good morning everyone and thanks for taking my questions. I guess Ed, a housekeeping question, are you able to disclose kind of the cadence of domestic PRASM over the course of 2Q by month? Ed Bastian : Domestic PRASM by month, I don\u2019t have that in front of me, but we\u2019ve disclosed that already. Andrew Didora : Okay. I will add just another words. Ed Bastian : We did overall not domestic. We will need to get back to you. We don\u2019t have that in front of us. Andrew Didora : Okay. And then Paul in your prepared remarks, you had 15% hedged for the rest of the year obviously remains lower than where you have been in the past. How are you thinking about hedging now that oil has stayed in this kind of 60-ish dollar per barrel range now for good part of the year? Are you content remaining to float at these levels? Are you interested in lettering on some more hedges as we go throughout the course '15? Paul Jacobson : Good morning, Andrew. We haven\u2019t actually materially changed our hedge profile really since February. We\u2019ve been kind of sitting back watching the market there. There isn\u2019t really any urgency here and we\u2019re not really changing the course of action and we\u2019re content with where the book sits right now. Andrew Didora : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen & Company. Helane Becker : Thanks very much operator. Hi guys. Thanks for the time. Did you say and I missed the three cities that you were seeing weakness in, in the demotic market and can you say if you didn\u2019t? Paul Jacobson : We did not say but they are Chicago, Dallas and Orlando. Helane Becker : Great, okay. Thank you. And then my other question is, you guys do deliver a pretty amazing product to your customers on out of some pretty tough markets in which top rated like the Northeast where you get a lot of thunderstorms and a lot of air traffic control issues and so on. So two questions A and B, one, as you get bigger especially in New York, how do you ensure that you continue to deliver that great operational performance and then B, is do your code share and JV partners deliver the same product and how do you ensure that your customers get the same product across all Delta code, coded flights. Thanks. Richard Anderson : Let me try to answer those. As to the second point without going into the specifics because they're proprietary to Delta, we have very good programs to be certain that our products are consistent across our code share partners both domestically and internationally. And we have a pretty significant focus on that and some firm specific proprietary strategies and processes that actually have our connection carriers running better on reliability basis in some of our mainline competitors. And I think in New York and in Minneapolis and Detroit where you have really cold weather all the time in Atlanta, we have just made a lot of investments and I think have the leading management operations management team in the world for an airline. And if you look at the performance of our operation, there is no airline even close to our size that performs at the kinds of levels and I think Ed had described it well at an Analyst Conference a while back last year and we\u2019re going to beat the record this year, but last year we had in the domestic system I think 195 days where we didn\u2019t cancel a domestic flight. I think American, United and Southwest together add 12 and it just -- that same operating knowhow and capability which is driving huge share and revenue shifts to Delta can continue to improve and will continue to improve because we\u2019re just about at scale in both JFK and LaGuardia. Helane Becker : Okay. So as we think about that, it\u2019s really that you\u2019re making investments on the technology side or on that the air, I guess the air side technology wise in an effort to really drive this improved performance because you\u2019re also doing it with fewer air traffic controllers and a pretty big decline in the ATC system as well. Richard Anderson : We are, but we also had employees that are all incredibly committed to making the airline run and there is -- in the end, there is no substitute for the power of the -- and the knowhow of the employees. But I would say it\u2019s a merrier of investments. Its better planning tools. It's a lot of technology investment. Its core reliability investments. Its process investment and how we build our schedules. It\u2019s a very long list of actions that we\u2019ve taken over time and investments that we\u2019ve taken over time. Helane Becker : Great. Thank you so much for the time. I really appreciate it Richard. Paul Jacobson : Helane, if I could jump in I just want to clarify one, Andrew from Merrill Lynch asked earlier about our domestic unit revenues by month, domestic unit revenue in April was flat. Domestic unit revenue in May was down 3% and in June it was also down 3%. So I just wanted to give that additional of that. Operator : Our next question comes from Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs. Tom Kim : Hi, good morning. Thanks for your time. Glen, I just want to press a little bit on your comment on corporate demand, how do I sort of reconcile some of the industry commentary about the weakness in close in bookings with your comment that corporate demand remains really strong. Glen Hauenstein : I don\u2019t know where that weakness in close in bookings came into play and I apologize for not knowing when that comment was made, but it really has not been a weakness in close end bookings. It's been a weakness in close and yield and there is a big difference in there. If corporate was not travelling, that would be one that where there was a demand weakness in terms of total load factor that would lead you to one conclusion. If there was a weakness in Europe because of a change in pricing that would lead you to a different conclusion. So I did want to clarify that because I have read it in several reports where people were talking about close in demand deterioration, which is not what Delta has experienced, but we have experienced closing yield deterioration in several key business markets. Tom Kim : Okay. Thanks for clarifying that. And then I just wanted to also ask you maybe a little bit of a longer-term question in nature with regard to ancillaries and your other segment category. This year looks like it\u2019s going to be a flat if not a down year for passenger revenue, but clearly you\u2019re seeing really good growth in contribution from other avenues and I\u2019m just wondering we had nearly two strong good years of growth, can you give us a sense of what 2016 growth rate should look like as we start to try to model something around? Is it something that\u2019s arguably a little bit more defensive or little bit more resilient where we consider kind of head on little bit more certainty? Richard Anderson : I think we\u2019ll save that for our Investor Day later in the year, but while it's safe to say is some of the products are very, very popular with our customers are still very difficult to purchase from us and so 2016 is about arguably to bring us to the market in a much more user-friendly environment and continue to expand our products and services we have. So we see a lot of continued upside through '16 and I think we\u2019ll save the punch line for our next Investor Day. Tom Kim : Okay. Fair enough. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi Syth : Hey good morning. Two questions, the first is on the third quarter unit revenue guidance, I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on what you\u2019re expecting from an FX and fuel surcharge? And then generally if there is any expectation of trend change within the regions? Richard Anderson : We\u2019re pulling out little bit of it, Glen, do you have other ones. Go ahead. Glen Hauenstein : FX surcharges are about half a point. Richard Anderson : Okay. Paul Jacobson : Savi you asked for the FX impact and the impact of surcharges, the FX is about three points and surcharge is about half point for the third quarter. Savi Syth : Okay. And then generally the trends in there especially in national regions you\u2019re expecting a continuation of what you\u2019re seeing in the second quarter? Richard Anderson : Yes, we are. Savi Syth : Okay. And just a second question on the -- in Brazil and Mexico with the Open Skies like they're coming on here and the potential to do a antitrust immunized JV with your partners; just wondering, one is there sufficient swaps in this markets to take advantage of a situation and then also what a kind of ATI JV might contribute versus the type of partnership we have today with these partners? Richard Anderson : Well obviously in the key markets in Sao Paulo, Mexican City there is a lot constrained and this will take time to continue to build out the efficiencies, but as we create the joint ventures and get our operations working together, we think there will be opportunities to certainly increase throughput there in the big markets and then to me more importantly working throughout the domestic landscape in both markets. Savi Syth : What\u2019s the benefit of getting an ATI JV here and I know the chance you can just do a little bit more scheduling and what can you do today that you could do with that and what kind of contribution can we think of? Richard Anderson : With ATI protection, we can go to the market together. So we can sell together. We schedule together. Our international feet, today we can\u2019t do that in those markets. Savi Syth : Thank you. Jill Sullivan Greer : We\u2019re going to have time for one more question. Operator : Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Joseph DeNardi : Hey thanks. Good morning. Sorry to harp on the PRASM here, but just kind of the walk from 3Q to 4Q, I guess the sense that there is some skepticism about the flat 4Q, is it just a function of the surcharges and FX comps get easier in 4Q and then you get the benefit of lower capacity. Is that how you guys are kind of planning forward to get to flat in fourth quarter? Richard Anderson : To be specific we said by year-end. So we set by fourth quarter and yes, there will be considerable amount of capacity reallocations potentially in the international arena. We will lapse the effects, the big effects of the unit revenue hedge largely from the fourth quarter on FX and our goal is to get the -- as we\u2019re heading into 2016 on a positive trajectory. Joseph DeNardi : Okay. And then Glen on the basic economy product, can you just walk me through how broadly that\u2019s deployed across the network at that point and whether that\u2019s contributing to any of the yield weakness you're seeing domestically? Glen Hauenstein : Absolutely it\u2019s not contributing to the yield weakness because it\u2019s a very restricted product that really isn\u2019t purchased by most of our corporate clients. So as a matter of fact many of the corporate agreements we have exclude that as well as here in the marketplace. So what we\u2019ve seen is a very high up-sell rate from that. Once people see what that fare is and what it offers that they\u2019re actually not purchasing that. So through delta.com when you look at that fare and then you are presented with other option 65% of the customers opt out of that fare. And so we actually think that\u2019s yield accretive for leisure and really not very applicable for business travelers. Joseph DeNardi : Okay. So as you see more people opt out of it, does that result in you guys reducing the capacity that you\u2019re allocating to basic economy? Glen Hauenstein : No, when I say opt out of that fare that means they\u2019re purchasing a higher fare on that flight. So if and let's just give an example of this, if the lowest fare from Detroit to Orlando is $59 and that was match of an existing spirit fare from it was presented on delta.com the $59 gets you a product that is without a seat assignment most people are opting not to take that fare, but to take the next higher fare, which is essentially an added on price. Joseph DeNardi : Okay. Thank you. Jill Sullivan Greer : Okay. Let\u2019s then include the analysts portion of the call and I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Kevin Shinkle, our Chief Communications Officer. Kevin Shinkle : Thanks Jill. We have a limited amount time for media. So we'll as many questions as possible. Please keep them brief and limit yourself to one follow-up. And with we'll go to our first call. Operator : Our first question comes from Susan Carey with Wall Street Journal. Susan Carey : Good morning. Could you all tell us a little bit more about your plans for Skymark? Ed Bastian : Sure Susan. This is Ed. We are discussing with the creditors of Skymark the opportunity to invest as part of their rehabilitation and reconstruction process. We\u2019ve long been fairly public about our interest in having a local domestic Japanese partner. This is an opportunity essentially to create that, but I think it\u2019s premature to speculate as to the odds of success of where this is going to go given there is a lot of unique attributes to the Japanese rehabilitation process that are been explored and we have -- we\u2019re in the discussion phase. Susan Carey : Thank you. Let me just follow-up with one more, what\u2019s going to happen to the airplane orders for the 737900s and the Embraer 190s as a result of this pilot rejection? Richard Anderson : Those orders will be canceled. Susan Carey : That\u2019s Richard speaking. Richard Anderson : Yes. Susan Carey : Okay, thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Dominic Gates with Seattle Times. Dominic Gates : Hi, wanted to ask first you had a very heavy growth here in Seattle 35% year-on-year. Are you expecting the same level of growth to continue? What\u2019s your projection? Richard Anderson : We couldn\u2019t hear that question. Could you just speak up. Dominic Gates : Sorry, I\u2019ll switch to handset. Are you expecting to maintain the same level of growth out of Seattle in SeaTac as you've had in the past year? Richard Anderson : We have said that our growth will start to meter down a bit, but we still are projecting future growth in SeaTac yes. Dominic Gates : All right, but do you got a number on that? Richard Anderson : We have not given a number, no. Dominic Gates : And can I just follow-up the longer terms Transpacific strategy, could you just talk about where you see that going and about your fleet replacement plans there? Richard Anderson : We think that the Pacific continues to be a bright spot in terms of global economic development and Seattle of course is our best positioned U.S. hub. We\u2019re very enthusiastic about the results to date in Seattle and today as of last month we are connecting now to over 700 people a day in SeaTac to firm our domestic system to our international network. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s very important for us to continue to work with the city to ensure that we had adequate facilities to be able to create a world-class connecting opportunity in the City of Seattle. So we\u2019re very enthusiastic about the potential in the future and we\u2019re committed to working with the communities to make sure that, that facility is a world-class experience for connecting customers. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeffery Dastin with Reuters. Jeffery Dastin : Thank you very much for your time. Would a deal with Skymark may strengthen Delta\u2019s relationship with Korean Air less important or would the two complement each other? Richard Anderson : We\u2019re not going to speculate on future transactions Jeffery. Jeffery Dastin : Okay. Thank you very much. Richard Anderson : Well, if there are no other calls, I think we can conclude -- no other questions, we\u2019ll conclude this call. Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

My name is Melody and I will be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow today's presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Jill Sullivan Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Jill Sullivan Greer : Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our September quarter call. Speaking on the call from Atlanta today are Delta's CEO, Richard Anderson; our President, Ed Bastian; and our CFO, Paul Jacobson. We have the entire leadership team here with us for the Q&A. Richard will open the call, Ed will then address our financial and revenue performance, and Paul will conclude with a review of our cost performance and cash flow. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Richard Anderson. Richard Anderson : Thanks, Jill. This morning, Delta reported a $2.2 billion pretax profit for the September quarter, a 33% improvement year-on-year, as our business continues to perform exceptionally well. We delivered earnings per share of $1.74 versus consensus estimates of $1.71. As demand is good, we essentially held revenues flat against a steep decline in fuel which allows Delta to bring about two-thirds of our fuel savings to the bottom-line for our owners. Therefore despite economic uncertainty in some international markets such as Brazil and Japan, and the impact of a strong dollar, we were able to expand operating margins by 5 points to 21%, and improve earnings per share by 45%. We generated $2.4 billion in operating cash flow and $1.4 billion in free cash flow in the quarter, and we have delivered a return on invested capital of 26.3% for the last 12 months. We reduced our net debt by $1 billion year-on-year, held our non-fuel CASM growth to 0.9% in the quarter, and we have returned over $2 billion of cash to our owners year-to-date. These types of results investors expect from a high quality industrial company like Delta, our metrics rank among the top 10% of S&P Industrials. Our free cash flow performance puts Delta in the company of companies like 3M and Lockheed Martin. Our work over the past decade has produced a strong and durable foundation. We have consistently hit our EPS and cash flow commitments over the years. We will leverage that foundation in order to consistently produce strong and dependable earnings and cash flows throughout the business cycle. At the base of that foundation are the people of Delta, and our unique employee culture. Our outstanding results this quarter were made possible by the dedication of our employees who work hard every day to provide the best operation and service in the industry. Last month, we took steps to improve wages for our employees and announced a 14.5% base pay rise for our ground and flight attendant groups that will take effective December 1. This will be accompanied by a change to our profit sharing program starting in 2016 in a response to feedback from our employees who want more certainty in their base pay while maintaining a variable component of compensation that is tied to the company's profitability and align all of our incentives across the enterprise. We continue to run by far the industry's best operation. In September quarter, we delivered a record 99.9 completion factor, including 40 days with zero cancellations, and our on-time rate improved to a point 86.1%. In the month of September alone we cancelled only 13 flights out of more than 83,000 performance our competitors will not match and I actually have to repeat that. In September alone we cancelled only 13 flights out of more than 83,000 flights and our competitors can't match it. This type of performance and the investments we have made in our network and products are driving the best revenue generation in the industry as our domestic premium stands at 14%. We continue to benefit from the decline of fuel prices, which provided more than $1 billion of benefit this quarter, and at current prices will drive a $750 million benefit in 4Q. As a result, we are uniquely positioned among global industrial peers to drive record earnings in the face of a strong dollar and economic uncertainty in some international markets. The level of cash we expect to generate from these earnings will put us in the top 10% of the S&P 500. While industrial revenue is currently weaker because of the strong dollar and the runoff of fuel surcharges, we still have strong margins, overall because of lower fuel, and we see good opportunity over the long-term internationally. To this end, two of our major initiatives over the past several years have been investing in our Latin network and restructuring our Pacific franchise. During the quarter we increased our stake in GOL Aereos down in Brazil, the largest Brazilian domestic carrier to just under 10% and also entered into a long-term exclusive partnership with China Eastern to build a hub in Shanghai which includes our taking a 3.5% ownership position in China Eastern. Ultimately JVs will give us the foundation to build the leading U.S. gateways to China and Brazil, including hubs in Shanghai and Sao Paulo with our great partners China Eastern, China Southern, and GOL. Our partnerships with these carriers, along with Virgin and Aeromexico, will further our efforts in these regions and in Western Europe and Mexico and provide significant long-term upside for Delta. Delta is quite unique in these investment strategies as we are the only U.S. carrier with equity investments coupled with long-term JVs, and commercial cooperation with airlines in Asia, the United Kingdom, and Latin America. We've proven with Air France-KLM, and Virgin Atlantic that we have a unique model that creates huge value for our owners. The cash we are generating allows us to fortify our balance sheet. We've reduced our net debt by more than $10 billion over the last several years and we're on track to reach $4 billion in net debt by 2017. This progress has been recognized by the rating agencies and today we are just one notch away from investment grade, as we run this company on investment grade metrics. At the same time, we accelerate capital returns to our owners; we repurchased 8% of our equity since buying our first share just 26 months ago. We expect to return $2.5 billion of cash to our owners this year and we will continue returning more than 50% of free cash flow to our owners going forward. We have a significant opportunity ahead, as fuel prices remained low, and we continue to push forward to achieve positive RASM. RASM growth remains a key component of how we drive margin improvement over time and we remain committed to improving our unit revenue trajectory. Our plan is to manage the business tightly and preserve the fuel savings to drive margin expansion. In May, we outlined the key metrics specific long-term targets for our business to attain. These include delivering annual EPS growth of greater than 15%, achieving returns on capital of 20% to 25%, and generating operating and free cash flow in the range of $7 billion to $8 billion and $4 billion to $5 billion respectively. We have consistently achieved our long-term goals and will continue to do so regardless of the direction of fuel prices. For the fourth quarter, our system capacity will be flat year-on-year, with fuel down about 40% year-on-year. We expect another record quarter with operating margins in 4Q of 16% to 18%. In addition, strong cost discipline is imperative since 2008. We have kept our non-fuel cost growth below at 2% compounded annual growth rate. We're using the current environment to evaluate and improve cost across all parts of the business, including our overhead functions, making sure that we're investing in the right parts of the business, and at levels we can sustain over time, regardless of fuel prices and the economic cycle. As we lay out the framework for 2016, we are not recasting our business to low fuel prices. Instead we budget fuel prices significantly higher than the forward curve because fuel remains volatile we will prudent in how we manage our expense, capital, and our capacity. Our initial plan is for 2016 capacity to be in the range of flat to up 2%. We believe that this is an appropriate level of growth to balance capital investment, supply, and demand and ensure the momentum in our business continues. By prudently managing all aspects of our business we can make strong progress against our financial targets continue to work towards earning the premium valuation of other high quality industrials who produce similar results to Delta's the results we announced today. But with that said Delta today trades at a 40% discount to our S&P peer group. So before I turn the call over to Ed and Paul to go through the details of the quarter, I want to congratulate Jill Greer, on her promotion to Vice President, very well deserved and thank you for all your contributions to Delta. With that, Ed. Ed Bastian : Thanks, Richard. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. We delivered the best quarter ever posted in the industry, the September quarter, with pretax income increasing 33% to $2.2 billion. Thanks to the Delta employees for their contributions to an outstanding quarter, a performance that drove our profit sharing accrual of more than $560 million. This brings our profit sharing total to $1.1 billion year-to-date. We have already surpassed the total profit sharing paid last year, so the upcoming Valentine's Day will be especially sweet for our Delta team. We expanded our operating margin more than 5 points to 21% which is at the high end of our initial guidance range. Our revenues were roughly flat despite facing a $235 million headwind from foreign exchange. Our commercial initiatives are producing great revenue momentum. Corporate demand remains solid with volume growth of 5%. In the domestic entity, corporate growth was notably strong in the Transcons and West Coast markets as we successfully leverage our investments in New York, LA, and Seattle. We saw meaningful improvements in our healthcare, financial services, and media sectors, offsetting declines in energy and manufacturing. We have rolled out branded fares in 462 markets and the initiative continues to go well delivering an additional $75 million in high margin revenue for the quarter. We are especially pleased with sales in Comfort+ which increased 42% and First Class upsell where we increased our paid first class load factor to 56% up 8 points year-over-year on a base of 5% more First Class seats. Our agreement with American Express produced over $100 million in incremental value this quarter. As you may recall we renewed our contract with American Express at the end of last year. We have a great partner in American Express and continue to expect the revenue benefits will double over the next few years as we work together to enhance our leading co-brand offering for customers. Our cargo business is facing a similar dynamic to our passenger business with domestic performing well, while the international business is facing significant currency and related demand headwinds. For the September quarter, passenger unit revenues declined 4.9% which was in the upper half of our initial guidance range of down 4.5% to down 6.5%. Domestic unit revenues declined 3%, as yield pressures continue in a fashion similar to previous quarters. Despite the yield decline, we are quite pleased with the profitability of the domestic business. We've been able to expand our domestic revenue premium while growing our top-line cost effectively through higher gauge and strategically expanding service in our hubs in New York, Seattle, and Los Angeles. Our Seattle domestic RASM was on par with the entity average despite a 24% increase in capacity. Our significant investment in the city has grown regional connectivity and local traffic and yield strength is outpacing capacity growth. The RASM performance in New York and Los Angeles was both above system average as the benefits of our investments continue to mature. JFK-LAX saw RASM improvement and load factors up 3 points. Our international business continued to face headwinds from foreign exchange and lower fuel surcharges. We are actively addressing these areas of weakness by making sizeable capacity reductions in the winter schedule. The TransAtlantic entity was challenged by currency pressure and industry capacity growth outpacing past year demand. Currency pressures in the quarter were partially offset by improved U.S. dollar point of sale. As a result, unit revenues in the TransAtlantic declined 9.5% with 6.5 points of that income impact coming from FX which represented $120 million from that entity alone. Core European market demand remained strong though but we are addressing the headwinds in Africa, Middle East, and Russia. Our TransAtlantic JVs with Air France-KLM and Virgin Atlantic saw margins expand once again despite these continued currency pressures. We are using the success of these joint ventures as the model as we deepen our partnerships with carriers in other parts of the world. We also acquired six additional pairs of slots in London, Heathrow which will further strengthen our position in the most important business market in Europe. In Latin America, our unit revenues were down 5% driven entirely by currency, primarily in Brazil. Our capacity growth in the regions slowed to 2% this quarter after eight consecutive quarters of growth that was materially above the system average. Mexico and the Caribbean are mostly U.S. dollar point of sale and as a result continue to do well. During the quarter, we increased our ownership stake in GOL to just under 10% and we continue to work closely with them to address the economic uncertainties in Brazil. We expect Open Skies with Brazil in the next year and intend to file for an antitrust immunity shortly thereafter. We also expect to receive the antitrust immunity and establish a joint venture with Aeromexico in the coming months. Ultimately we expect to have immunized profit sharing joint ventures with the leading carriers in the two largest markets in Latin America. In the Pacific, the revenue environment remains challenging, with unit revenues down 9% during the peak resort market season on 4 points of lower capacity. Currency and fuel surcharges were a 14 point drag on unit revenue in the quarter. Specifically the end revenue headwind was $55 million net of hedges. As we've outlined previously, restructuring our Pacific network is one of our biggest opportunities for margin improvement going forward. We are pleased with the initial results we are achieving. Our Narita hub margins expanded by 7 points, excluding hedges over the last 12 months and we have restored the hub to profitability. There is certainly more work to get to our targeted return levels but this an important milestone with the entity. And we have taken the next step forward by making a $450 million investment in China Eastern and establishing a long-term commercial partnership. China Eastern is one of the largest Chinese airlines and the home carrier in Shanghai, the commercial capital of China. And this relationship will allow Delta to broaden its reach in Asia. Now, looking ahead to the December quarter, we will continue to leverage opportunities in our network, while reducing capacity in areas most affected by currency, macro, and geopolitical uncertainties. Our domestic pretax margins improved 8 points ex-hedges to 22% in the September quarter, with our largest hubs delivering margins well above this level. As a result of the continued strong performance in the domestic market, we are planning for 3% growth in this region for the fourth quarter in line with how we see demand and economic growth in the U.S. Our domestic growth is focused on areas where past investments will now allow us to offer superior network, product, and service which is enhancing profitability and returns and driving the expansion in our domestic unit revenue premium to the industry. We will reduce international capacity by 4.5% this quarter, with cuts of 20% or more in places like Japan, Brazil, Russia, and the Middle East, while we continue to invest in certain parts of our international network like Mexico and China. The combination of domestic growth and international reductions will result in our capacity being flat at the system level for the fourth quarter and we expect these actions to help drive improvement in our unit revenue performance which we forecast will decline 2.5% to 4.5% for the December quarter. This forecast includes a 2 point headwind from currency. The quarter will be a bit choppy. November is expected to post the best monthly result and December the weakest due to the Thanksgiving holiday shift, with October somewhere in between. This conservative growth profile in an environment where we expect fuel prices will be down by almost half demonstrates our commitment to getting RASM on a positive trajectory. While we said as the goal early this year to get RASM flat to positive by year-end, the continued low fuel price environment, and steeper FX headwinds have made achievement of our goal more challenging. In fact, fuel prices have declined 25% further from when we initially set this goal in early June. But it's still an important goal for our commercial team even if it happens on a slightly longer timeline. While we may say pressure for RASM for longer, we are getting significantly larger cost savings from fuel and therefore margin and cash flow benefits. So as a result we expect a record fourth quarter with an operating margin of 16% to 18%, up 4.5 points on a year-over-year basis. Now, I will turn the call over to Paul to go through details on cost and cash flows. Paul Jacobson : Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I will start by highlighting another strong cost performance at Delta this quarter. Lower fuel prices and strong cost controls contributed to a roughly $650 million decline in total operating expenses, despite 3% higher capacity. Non-fuel CASM increased by 1% as we continue to benefit from our re-fleeting and cost reduction initiatives. The benefit accrual related to the recently announced pay increases for Delta employees created about a point of pressure that was not included in our initial outlook, but our performance remained consistent with our stated goal. We have built a good foundation for cost productivity and our up-gauging initiatives are creating operating leverage that will benefit us for years to come. In fact, in 2008, our domestic gauge has increased from about 104 to 118 seats and we expect it will increase further over the next several years. FX also benefitted non-fuel CASM by a little more than a point during the quarter. Looking ahead to the December quarter, we expect non-fuel CASM to be up about 2%, expenses related to the pay increases that go into effect on December 1 are creating about a point of pressure, while air national capacity reductions are also creating a temporary headwind for CASM as the cost takeout associated with these changes comes at a lag. Turning to fuel, our total fuel expense declined by over $1 billion in the quarter; as well market fuel prices more than offset higher consumption. Our all-in fuel price was $1.80 per gallon down from $2.90 in the same period last year. We expect this will be below the industry average price for the quarter. The refinery made a record $106 million profit this quarter, up from $19 million in the same period last year. Lower crude cost, a favorable crack spread environment, and increased throughput drove the refineries profit. Our average throughput at the refinery for the quarter was 200,000 barrels per day and we produced over 40,000 barrels per day of jet fuel at the plant. For fourth quarter we are projecting a profit of approximately $30 million for the refinery, which would bring the full year contribution to $320 million. The moderation from 3Q profit levels is driven by typical seasonality in crack spread. We currently expect our December quarter fuel expense will be $750 million lower year-over-year. Our December 2015 results are net of roughly $250 million in hedge losses. At a $1.75 to $1.80 per gallon our fourth quarter fuel price will be $0.85 per gallon below last year's all-in fuel price and we expect again to be below the industry average. For the fourth quarter we are approximately 40% hedged against an increase in prices with approximately 70% downside participation to Brent prices of $40 per barrel. Moving onto cash flow we are using our strong cash generation in a balanced, deliberate, and sustainable manner, to reinvest in the business for long-term, further strengthen the balance sheet, and return increasing levels of cash to shareholders. This quarter we generated $2.4 billion of operating cash flow which provided us with an ability to fund a strategic investment in China Eastern, a partnership that will drive significant value overtime. Capital spending for the third quarter was just over $1 billion including China Eastern and GOL strategic investments made during the quarter. For the December quarter, we are projecting roughly $1 billion in CapEx also which consists of aircraft acquisition, fleet modification, and includes the purchase of the six pairs of slots at Heathrow that Ed mentioned earlier. Free cash flow during the third quarter was $1.4 billion of which 40% was returned to shareholders including $107 million of dividends and $425 million of buybacks. We expect to return roughly $500 million to shareholders again in the fourth quarter. That will bring us to roughly $2.5 billion in returns this year which equates to 7% of our current market cap and approximately 60% of our free cash flow. We continue to expect to return more than $6 billion through 2017, while also reducing debt to $4 billion while we continue to proactively fund our pension plan. Adjusted net debt at the end of September was $6.4 billion and our debt reduction lowered interest expense by $33 million in the quarter relative to last year. We expect our debt to trend slightly higher in Q4 due to seasonality in cash but will end the year below $7 billion as we remain on track to hit our goal. The improvements in our balance sheet were recognized this quarter with upgrades from S&P and Fitch, which both now has Delta just one notch away from investment grade. That momentum allowed us in August to refinance our senior secured credit facility ahead of its scheduled maturity. The new borrowings included $1.5 billion undrawn revolver, a $500 million term loan, and a $500 million double EETC with a blended rate of 3.8%. Because of the improved strength of our balance sheet we were able to lower the overall rate we are paying on this debt, increase our revolver capacity by $275 million, and lowering the outstanding principle by $320 million as we continue to work towards our goals. In closing, I'd like to thank the entire Delta family for another very strong quarter; this was achieved as a result of your contribution. Jill? Jill Sullivan Greer : Thanks Richard, Ed, and Paul. And with that, Melody, we're ready for Q&A with the analysts, so if you could give them instructions on how to get into the queue. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We will go to Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Andrew Didora : Hi, good morning everyone. I guess my first question, Ed can you maybe provide what your flat to up 2 capacity looks like next year broken out on a domestic and international basis? And then just from a domestic perspective are there any specific markets where this growth will be concentrated or any specific market or markets you plan to build out a larger presence in like you've done in Seattle this year? Ed Bastian : Andrew we will provide more detail at our Investor Day in December on 2016 plans, obviously the shape of 2016 is following what you're seeing in the fourth quarter with domestic up in line with general economic growth in the U.S. and international down in the areas with the greatest FX and demand weakness. Andrew Didora : Got it. And then just a follow-up for Paul. I guess at this level of flat to up 2% capacity do you still feel like you can keep unit cost growth at or below 2% next year outside of any new pilots agreement? Paul Jacobson : Yes, we do Andrew, I think the capacity is going to put a little bit pressure on unit costs but given the productivity goals that we have and the continued benefits of the leverage that we're driving in the operation we feel good about our ability to hit that goal for the year. Operator : We'll go next to Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Darryl Genovesi : Hi guys, thanks for taking the time. So may be first on the 2016 capacity guide, if I look at your first-quarter published flight schedules it looks like you've scheduled kind of 4% capacity growth or so. Would you expect a downward revision there or are you essentially just implying a very front-end loaded year? Ed Bastian : That's very preliminary, Darryl. Yes we really haven't got it and made the final revisions to Q1 or for that matter any part of '16. And I just want to let you know; traditionally we've reduced the schedule as we get closer in. Darryl Genovesi : Okay. And then on the -- if I just look at the domestic unit revenue performance in the quarter, the down 3% number that you reported, if I were to just look at entirely domestic itineraries, would that number reflect a smaller decline because of the -- and is there an impact from essentially the accounting allocation of domestic connections on international itineraries that are weighing down the domestic number as reported? Richard Anderson : There's a little bit less than 1 point of domestic itineraries that are related to the international O&D. Darryl Genovesi : Okay. So you're saying 1% of RASM headwind or 1% is kind of the mix? Richard Anderson : Of the 3 points a little less than 1 point is international operational itinerary that's related to the FX change. Darryl Genovesi : Great, thank you. And then if I could just squeeze one last one in for Paul, Paul, the comment that you made a few minutes ago about still seeing unit cost growth trending below 2% next year I assume that would be inclusive of profit sharing, is that correct? Paul Jacobson : Yes, that's how we look at it. We'll have some geography changes in 2016. We'll highlight all that in Investor Day. Operator : Our next question comes from comes from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Jamie Baker : Hey, good morning everybody and Richard you beat me to it. I thought I caught a new title for Jill in the opening remarks, so my congratulations there as well. A question for Glen. I do understand, I think we all understand the issues that are impacting international RASM. What I'm really having difficulty with is reconciling the domestic weakness. I mean, if you or I had been in a coma for five years and somebody just handed us the A4A revenue report or even your Q3 domestic RASM print, my first guess would be crap, we're in the recession again. But the fact is we aren't and other consumer sectors don't suggest this level of demand weakness. So what sort of explanation and you highlighted DPIJ in Darryl's question, but what further explanation can you provide as to why domestic RASM quite frankly stinks and more importantly what you think has to happen either at Delta or the industry level to improve upon it? Glen Hauenstein : Yes, Jamie, as a rule we don't talk about the industry we talk about Delta. So I'll talk --what that is. Jamie Baker : Sure, fair enough. Glen Hauenstein : I think Ed highlighted in his comments that we see demand as strong and we see even business itinerary demand as strong, so closed end short stay travel and corporate contracted travel are all at record levels but we are not obtaining the yields that we had in the past. And I'll just leave it at that. Jamie Baker : Okay. Second, not sure if this is for Ed or for Richard but and I know you don't tend to comment publicly on pilot negotiations, but when we think about profit sharing going forward what's management's tolerance for operating two succinct profit sharing schemes, one being more generous than the other? And also and I suppose I should know this but are the Air Canada 190s still up for grabs? The one that initially had been part of the fleet plan assuming a ratified TA? Ed Bastian : And you asked and answered the first question which is we don't generally comment on the status of pilot negotiations. We respect the process and we respect the relationship. We're perfectly inclined to run two profit sharing programs. Our regular employees have been very pleased with 14.5% raise and I think we still have -- they'll still have one of the most if not well they'll still have the most lucrative profit sharing program in the industry. And so that's on the profit sharing and what was your second question? Jamie Baker : Just whether the E190s, the Boeing/Air Canada E190s are still up for grab. I think Boeing had made that part of your initial aircraft agreement. Ed Bastian : I don\u2019t know whether they are or not. Jamie Baker : Okay. Ed Bastian : We had signed agreement with Boeing and when the TA was rejected we had the right to terminate it and then we terminated it and all the deposits were returned to Delta. And so you have to ask Boeing about what the status of those airplanes are. Operator : We'll go next to Julie Yates with Credit Suisse. Julie Yates : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Last quarter I believe you guys called out three specific cities that were driving the bulk of the weakness in the domestic market. Is that yield weakness in Q3 still limited to a small number of markets or has it spread to be more broad-based? Ed Bastian : Hi, Julie, it's, Ed. Yes, it's still relatively restricted. I would -- the commentary from the second quarter is consistent with the third quarter but it's still largely restricted yes. Julie Yates : Okay. And then on the capacity you're pulling done internationally are those planes being retired or reallocated or is this a reduction primarily through utilization? Glen Hauenstein : Combination of all of those. Some are being retired, some are getting lower utilization and some are moving into the domestic market place. For example, as United exits the JFK-LA and JFK San Francisco market, we are moving a couple of our wide bodies into fill out patterns in those key markets that are the largest markets in the United States. Richard Anderson : But then on top of that Julie, we have 757s retiring. So we have a significant number of 757, 200s that are leaving the fleet. Julie Yates : Okay, great. And then lastly any update on Open Skies with Brazil and Mexico and timing there. I think Brazil was supposed to happen sometime in October. Richard Anderson : There is no update, we expect some time in 2016 to get those ratified. Operator : Helane Becker with Cowen & Company has our next question. Helane Becker : Thanks very much, Operator. Hi guys, thank you very much for the time. Just two questions. One is can you comment at all on the type of competition you're seeing in some of your bigger cities like Atlanta and perhaps in LA specifically from low-fare airlines? Richard Anderson : You know, Helane, let me go at it from a macro perspective which is we have record margins in all of our hubs in the U.S. and virtually every part of the domestic business is performing at new record levels or at above record levels and that includes Seattle and LA and New York and Minneapolis and Detroit and Cincinnati and Salt Lake and Atlanta. And on top of that the focus city flying we do in places like Raleigh-Durham and Indianapolis is performing extraordinarily well. I think what the marketplace misses is that we are able to keep, if just look at the revenue picture at Delta, our revenue is relatively flat year-to-year and we're putting two-thirds of the fuel savings on the bottom line for the owners. And our focus is to manage the business for margin and cash flow. And we have a lot of leverage to do that. A fantastic product that no one in the industry can match, happy employees that are working very hard to be the best in the industry, a smart revenue management team, a very smart network planning team, the lowest capital cost in the industry on the fleet, and the maximum flexibility to manage our capacity to move back to positive RASM. Helane Becker : So, Richard, thank you for that. I really appreciate your answer. And I kind of wonder at the fact that the market seems to continually miss the fact that you are delivering the best product in the industry and continues to ask what do you do for an encore, you continue to deliver yet your stock price doesn't reflect it. Richard Anderson : Well actually our market cap does reflect it and our stock price does reflect it against the industry. I think our next closest domestic peer has a market cap it's $10 billion lower. And when you look at where the P -- the forward P is where our opportunity is, is to continue to derisk the balance sheet, derisk our business model, have the best employee relations in the industry, investment grade balance sheet, and continue to move our P/E up to match our performance versus the S&P Industrials and we're going to quietly continue to do that. Helane Becker : That's great. Thank you. Thanks very much for your help. Operator : We'll go next to Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Mike Linenberg : Yes, hey, good morning everybody. Hey, I just, I want to go back to in the non-op area some of your investments. I believe you account for Virgin Atlantic under the equity method. Can you just may be give us a feel for how much better that's running this year versus last year? And then just with the changes in your investments in some of these other carriers are they still accounted for as investments or say like a goal are you going to run that through under the equity method given your Board seat and your increased ownership stake? Ed Bastian : Hi, Mike, it's Ed. On Virgin, the Q3 results they had were fairly comparable to what they had a year ago, little bit better. They had some fairly large fuel hedging losses, so they haven't gotten as much of the pass-through on the lower fuel savings. But we expect that's going to get increasingly better next year. And the answer to your second question is no, we treat the China Eastern and GOL and Aeromexico investments still on the cost method. So we don't take the share profit or loss in the quarter. Mike Linenberg : Good. And then just one other and this is either for Ed or Paul. Your earnings progression has been fantastic on one hand. On the other hand it does get you closer to the point where you will start paying cash taxes. When I look at sort of where the numbers are in our forecast for next year it seems like sometime next year you may be a cash taxpayer may be in the latter part of the year. Is that right or do we still have enough NOLs that may be we get into 2017? What's your thoughts on that? Paul Jacobson : Hi, good morning, Mike, it's Paul. Mike Linenberg : Hey, Paul. Paul Jacobson : Go back to what we have talked about in May when we laid out our long-term plan, we anticipate that we will have some cash taxes until 2017 at our current trajectory but wouldn't become a full payer until 2018. That's consistent and you've got to be careful with the differences between GAAP and tax accounting for big areas like depreciation on fleet et cetera. Richard Anderson : Let Mike -- let me -- we're going to update at Investor Day on our tax rate going forward in 2016 and this is another differentiator for Delta that goes back to our international focus and our minority investments, equity investments around the world in our joint venture strategies. We can have an advantage tax position versus our domestic competitors and we're going to update that at our Investor Day in December. Mike Linenberg : Great. Looking forward to it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from David Fintzen with Barclays. David Fintzen : Hey, good morning everyone. A question for Glen. On the international side particularly Pacific obviously there's currency, there's probably demand as you highlighted, there's also surcharges that in some cases had to come out really quick. As you start to overlap that and you get into '16, do some of that surcharge revenue can you take that back into base pricing as you go a long? Or is that something we should just think is sort of gone until oil comes back? Glen Hauenstein : Well we have the currency headwinds which will as forward curves go from about $700 million this year to about $150 million next year. And then, as fuel stabilizes, we will of course attempt to raise fares as we always do but that will depend on what the market is and that's based on individual market performance. So we see strong demand, we see strong demand through the winter and into the spring already, and our load factors are running ahead in every entity including domestic throughout rest of the year. So hopefully who knows what's going to happen in the future but it looks like it's shaping up to be pretty good year in '16. David Fintzen : Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just in terms of the 4Q RASM guidance would you be willing to split that kind of domestic international or at least kind of speak to does the decline in moderate kind of reasonably evenly across different segments or entities? Or is there something that really stands out particularly, does domestic inflect as much? Glen Hauenstein : We're not going to break that out, David. We never do but you see that the trends that we've seen this year and you probably can draw your own conclusions. Operator : We'll go next to Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Rajeev Lalwani : Hi, thanks for the time. I just wanted to come back to your capacity guide and may be just better understand what factors we should look at to get you to may be a higher end or the lower end of that this year too and whether it's PRASM or margin in the economy? Just some color there would be great. Richard Anderson : All of the above. Rajeev Lalwani : Okay, easy enough. Then I guess a related question to that, to the extent as we look into next year demand starts to really weaken, et cetera, be it the economy or otherwise how aggressive do you think you could be with pulling down capacity just to keep supply demand balance? Richard Anderson : Look, I mean, we stay focused on margin and margin expansion and free cash flow we have many levers to drive those factors in our -- or those outcomes in our business. One of the things that we're fortunate at Delta in addition to having the most reliable fleet when we only cancelled 18 flights in the month of September tells you a lot about the fleet that we operate at the same time that we have a lot of paid-for airplanes. And the lever that we have in the business is that paid-for airplane if you decide to put 757 down it also becomes a parts depot for the rest of the fleet. So you not only have a good lever from the standpoint managing capacity it's also a non-fuel CASM play. Rajeev Lalwani : Great. Thank you. Richard Anderson : We have plenty of those -- we have optionality, we like optionality across our business. And so we view our fleet the same way as they're optional, many of those assets are optional assets. Operator : We'll go next to Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thanks, good morning. Paul, I wanted to ask you about hedging. Have you started adding positions into 2016 and can you tell us what the hedge loss you're baking in for the fourth quarter fuel guide and what the magnitude of the losses are at this point into 2016? Paul Jacobson : Hey, good morning, Duane thanks for the question. As we talked about we are only about 5% hedged for 2016. We obviously have taken this environment and been very cautious and slow about it as we look into to the year. We said in our prepared remarks that we got about $250 million of losses in the fourth quarter but about 70% to 80% downside participation all the way down to $40 a barrel in Brent. So as we go into 2016 obviously we have a tailwind behind us on fuel price because of the hedge losses in the first half of this year. But we're pretty cautious on where we go given the forward curve and the option premiums that you have to spend and put hedges on right now. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay and then may be just a different tack on the same question regarding your desire to control input costs. Have you evaluated expanding your presence in the energy industry beyond just owning a refinery? Have you looked at any potential domestic production assets? Richard Anderson : No, we haven't. Operator : Our next question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi Syth : Hey, good morning. Just a quick follow-up on some of the 2016 capacity questions. Is it fair to assume just given the current environment that domestic capacity growth would be similar to 2015 and 2016? Glen Hauenstein : I think it's early to comment on the intricacies of what 2016 turns out to be and I think what Richard pointed to earlier is the flexibility that this company has to respond to market demands as they evolve. And so I think we will give more color as what we think in December as we get to our Investor Day Conference. But we are always moving airplanes around or grounding them or whatever it takes to achieve our margin expansion that we need to. And while we like to say we have a full vision as to what next year's economy is going to be we don't. And so what we can say is we think it's 0 to 2 for next year as we sit down today and we will make those adjustments as we get closer into it capitalize on where we see opportunities. Richard Anderson : I think the thing that people don't have a full appreciation for just how rapidly we adjust to markets. And if you even just think out about 2015 and what we said we were going to do in December of '14, in fourth quarter 2015, situations change, currencies got weak in Brazil, currency got weak in Japan, fuel surcharges ran off, sanctions in Russia, and we've responded very quickly. And that's the wonderful thing about what these assets are. If you own a hotel in Manhattan and something doesn't go well in Manhattan and you can't move the hotel? Right. But we can take our frequencies in Venezuela down to one a week and we could take Russia down to one a week and you don't see all those moves, but the reason why we have ever expanding margins is at some point the Street just needs to understand that we're going to continue to manage the business to drive margin and free cash flow and we have a lot of leverage to do that. Savi Syth : Good plan. Just specifically on the fuel side I know you mentioned that two-thirds of the fuel declines have been captured to the bottom-line. I wonder if that's despite your kind of fuel hedge drag and is it your contention that may be if you didn't have the fuel hedge drag you'd still be able to have a similar capture and so may be the fare environment is may be stronger than that two-thirds would imply? Ed Bastian : Savi, it's Ed. I wouldn't try to draw any correlations to the fuel hedge. The two-thirds we're looking at was really the current quarter the September quarter we did. We had modest hedge losses. It wasn't material and compared to the first two quarters anyway. And you also have to take into account that two-thirds is a bit of a macro estimate, it's much higher on the domestic, I think domestic we were probably capturing 80% to 90% of the fuel savings. But internationally because of the currency weakness as well as demand weakness that's limiting our ability to capture as much as the fuel. So in total it's about two-thirds but very high domestically which is where we're growing and it's weaker internationally which is where we're shrinking. Savi Syth : Okay, that's very helpful. And if I could just ask one last one, on the regional fleet I know we saw the complaint filed again Republic. Should we be concerned with the impact of securing regional fee on kind of capacity plans or costs? Richard Anderson : No, you shouldn't be -- we're not going to comment specifically on the litigation but you shouldn't be concerned about that. We just like our partners to keep their deals. Jill Sullivan Greer : And Melody, we're going to have time for one more question from the analysts. Operator : Thank you. That will be from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Sam McKelvey : Hi, it's Sam McKelvey on for Joe DeNardi. What sort of pressure is the Gulf carrier issue having on your relationship with Air France-KLM? Are they wanting to add more capacity onto the Atlantic than you view is necessary to offset some of the share they are losing in other markets? Richard Anderson : Well first our relationship with Air France-KLM couldn't be better. Our combined margins in the Transatlantic couldn't be better in terms of the cut we're setting all time contribution margins in that joint venture. And it's by far the model of joint ventures in the world. We don't, as Glen said earlier, we're not commenting yet other than zero to two on our network and we're still building our business plan, we will give more color about what our forward capacity is. But in terms of our relationship with Air France-KLM I mean we're tightly synced in our operations, capacity planning, and distribution. Jill Sullivan Greer : That's going to conclude the analyst portion of the phone call. Before I turn it over to Kevin and the corp comm team just to have everybody save the date for December 17 for our Annual Investor Day and with that I will turn it over for the media unit. Kevin Shinkle : Good morning. I'm Kevin Shinkle, our Senior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer. Welcome to the media portion of our call. We have about 10 minutes to ask questions. So please limit yourself to one question and one brief follow-up. Melody, could you please try to give any instructions on how to register to ask a question. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We'll go to Michael Sasso with Bloomberg News. Michael Sasso : Good morning. Yes, I had there's kind of the rumor mill has been hot lately about Delta looking at some 777s coming out of Singapore. Can you just talk about that and is there any truth to that? Richard Anderson : Yes, I'd be glad to. Well we're seeing a huge bubble in excess wide-body airplanes around the world and we've been approached by more than one party. I mean the market appears to be the 777-200s about 9 to 10 years old the price is about $10 million. And on A330-200 the lease rate is about a fifth of what it would be new. So we do think that the aircraft market is going to be right for Delta and over the course of the next 12 to 36 months and we think that that weakness in that aircraft bubble in wide-bodies is going to spread to narrow-bodies and that there will be some huge buying opportunities because low interest rates really have created a huge wide-body bubble in the world. Singapore Airlines, I think has 70 of these airplanes that are coming off lease or being retired that are 8 to 10 years old. Michael Sasso : Just a follow-up. So is there a deal with actually in the works or recently completed for? Richard Anderson : There's no deal on the works we just -- it's a relatively small market in the world right there is not many people in the world that can take a dozen 777s, right, there's a handful of customers. It's a very small market, it's a very transparent market, and we get calls all the time. There is no deal. Prices are going to get lower; you wouldn't strike a deal now. Operator : We'll go next to Edward Russell with Flightglobal. Edward Russell : Hi yes. You mentioned the acquisition of six slot pairs at London Heathrow and looking at your schedules in 2016 at here and in Salt Lake City. Could you give some insight on to how well you plan to use those new slot pairs? Richard Anderson : We already operate in slot pairs. Edward Russell : A follow-up then, there is replacing slot that you have lease agreements coming up on or? Richard Anderson : The slots that we have leased previously for a number of years for Air France-KLM that we're just turning that we're purchasing instead of leasing. We will have more flexibility to slot them around with our partners at Virgin Atlantic. Operator : David Koenig with The Associated Press has our next question. David Koenig : Hi, thanks. I have a parochial question this time. We're waiting for a ruling in the Dallas Love Field litigation and I wonder whether you think if there's an adverse ruling or whatever ruling winds up would have it have an precedent setting affect that other gate or slot restrained airports or the -- the terms and situations so unique in Dallas that it would not. Richard Anderson : No. If Love Field is such an anomaly if you just step back and think about it, the city of Dallas is -- will be the first time in modern aviation that an airport and interstate commerce where the operators trying to evict and interstate commerce operator. I think it\u2019s actually the opposite and it won't have any effect. Operator : We'll go next to Sheryl Jean with Dallas Morning News. Sheryl Jean : Hi, I have a similar question along those lines at Dallas Love Fields. Can you give any insight into whether you're planning to appeal if the judge in that case does make an adverse ruling for Delta? Peter Carter : This is Peter Carter. We would intend to appeal any adverse ruling. Richard Anderson : And we still have administrative actions in front of the Federal Aviation Administration to revoke AIP grants in the PFCs they collect. Sheryl Jean : Thank you. Richard Anderson : You're welcome. Kevin Shinkle : Well, thank you. With that, that was the last question that will conclude our third quarter earnings conference call. Thanks to everyone for listening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, again, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

My name is Kelly Ann and I will be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following today's presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Ms. Jill Sullivan Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ma\u2019am. Jill Sullivan Greer : Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for our December quarter call. Joining us in Atlanta today are Richard Anderson, our CEO, Ed Bastian, our President and Paul Jacobson our Chief Financial Officer. We have the rest of the leadership team here in the room for our Q&A session. Richard will open the call, Ed will then address our financial and revenue performance, and Paul will conclude with a review of our cost performance and cash flow. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted and you can find the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I'll turn the call over to our Richard. Richard Anderson : Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone. This morning Delta reported a $1.45 billion pre-tax profit and delivered earnings per share of $1.18 for the fourth quarter of 2015. This result marks a 42% improvement year-on-year and was in line with consensus expectation. For the full year, we generated a $5.9 billion pre-tax profit, an increase of 29% over 2014. We grew our top line by 1% and realized substantial fuel savings which allowed us to expand operating margins by over 3 points to 16.2%. Our return on invested capital was 28.3% for 2015. We generated $3.8 billion of free cash flow and returned $2.6 billion of that back to our owners this year. Our 2015 financial performance ranks Delta among the top 10% of S&P Industrials. We are poised to continue outperforming as low fuel prices will allow us to produce further earnings and margin expansion in 2016 in the face of a strong dollar and some global economic uncertainty. I want to thank the entire Delta team for all their hard work that contributed to another record year in 2015. For their efforts, we accrued $1.5 billion in profit sharing for the full year 2015. We are looking forward to our largest profit sharing payout in our history on Valentine\u2019s Day 2016. Our people are the primary reason Delta is the top performing airline in the world and we are thankful for their commitment to our company. Our foundation at Delta is quite strong, similar to other high quality industrial companies our focus is to drive value for our owners through topline growth, margin expansion, double digit EPS growth and prudent deployment of our strong cash generation. As we highlighted at Investor Day last month, we have built a durable business model that can deliver strong results throughout the economic cycle. We continue to run the best operation by a wide margin of all the airlines in the world with a full year completion factor of 99.6% in an on time rate of 85.9%. We had a 161 100% main line completion factor days in 2015 which significantly outpaces American United and Southwest even if you combine their operations for the last several years. That operational excellence along with the investments we\u2019ve made in products and services drove increases in our customer satisfaction. With year-to-date domestic net promoter score increasing more than four points to 38% compared to 2014. The 4Q results show again that high levels of customer satisfaction are widening our revenue lead relative to the industry; we are consistently generating 108% of industry average revenues across our system and north of 114% in the domestic entity. Through our capacity actions and commercial initiatives, we offset nearly 700 million of currency pressure this year and held our topline revenues intact year-on-year. This performance allowed us to capture more than 75% of the fuel savings in 2015 which drove strong margin improvements. We expect to improve upon this great performance in 2016. The scale and scope of our network allow us to focus on regions of strength, adjust capacity and regions that are economically challenged and move our capital assets to markets with strong returns. As we continue to globalize our network through our uniquely Delta joint ventures and equity investments we will further enhance the flexibility and durability of our business which will allow us to continue to drive strong revenue margin and cash flow growth through our owners over the long term. Our focus on our long term goals is unwavering. We will continue to reinvest in the business at an appropriate level to sustain long term growth that disciplined reinvestment had delivered high levels of returns to our owners. The substantial free cash flow we are generating allows us to continue to de-risk the balance sheet. Our adjusted net debt declined $600 million to $6.7 billion in 2015 which is more than $10 billion lower than when we started almost a decade ago, and we think an investment grade rating will occur in 2016. At the same time we are accelerating capital returns to our shareholders and repurchased 7% of our market cap in 2015. Including the dividend, this is the equivalent of 70% of our free cash flow going back to our owners well above our 50% long term target. We remained strongly committed to exceeding our long term commitments to our owners. You will recall from our Investor Day, our long term goal is to sustain operating margins of 14% to 16%, to have EPS growth year-on-year at 15%, to maintain a return on invested capital of 20% to 25%, to generate atleast $7 billion to $8 billion of operating cash flow and atleast $4 billion to $5 billion of free cash flow and to reach $4 billion in adjusted net debt by 2020. We expect to significantly exceed these goals in 2016. We had a significant opportunity in 2016 as the decline in fuel prices will provide us with a $3 billion tailwind in 2016 at current levels. Low fuel prices do put some pressure on our unit revenues which we saw throughout 2015. It is important for us to produce unit revenue improvements and we are committed to doing so in 2016. However, our capacity discipline and service excellence are contributing to unit revenue outperformance for Delta relative to the industry. We expect to grow capacity between 0% and 2% in 2016 in appropriate level of growth to balance capital investment with supply and demand and ensure the momentum in our business continues. Strong non fuel cost discipline is critical to our long term success. In 2015, we kept our non fuel cost flat. Since the merger, we have grown non fuel cost at a rate of less than 2% on an annual basis while investing significantly in our people, customers, operation, fleet and product. We are on track to meet or exceed the targets we laid out for you last May and at our Investor Day of growing annual EPS greater than 15% and achieving returns on capital in excess of 20% and generating free cash flow in the range of 4 billion to 5 billion in 2016. We have consistently achieved our long term goals and we will continue to do so regardless of the direction of fuel prices. Our first quarter 2016 performance will break all records as we expect an operating margin of 18% to 20% in what is seasonally Delta\u2019s lower margin quarter. As we lay out the framework for 2016 and beyond we see big opportunities ahead for our business. The key message of our Investor Day last month was that we are a high quality industrial company built to deliver consistent and sustainable current [ph] returns through the cycle. We believe executing on this commitment should result in a premium evaluation that is in line with our peers who produce financial results similar to Delta. With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ed and Paul to go through the details of the quarter. Thank you. Ed Bastian : Thanks, Richard. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today. For the December quarter our pre-tax income increased 42% year-over-year to $1.45 billion. We expanded our operating margin more than 4.5 points to 17.1%. We are able to drive a significant improvement in our margins because we remained disciplined and strategic about our growth, which allowed us to capture more than 75% of the savings from lower fuel prices. For the quarter, we saw a five point improvement in domestic margins, while international margins improved by four points. Thanks to our Delta employees for the contributions to another strong quarter, performance that drove a profit sharing accrual of nearly $400 million bringing full year total to $1.5 billion. 2015 was another record year on all fronts and we look forward to rewarding the Delta team for driving industry leading operation and financial results on February the 12. We have the best employees in the industry driving superior performance which allows us to pay industry leading total compensation. Our revenues declined two points for the quarter versus the prior year driven by $160 million headwind from foreign exchange which means we were able to successfully push most of these fuel savings to the bottom line. Corporate demand remains solid with volume growth of 3%. Domestic continues to be strong particularly in the Transcons and West Coast markets. Corporate travel buyers recently named Delta the leading airline for the fifth consecutive year rating us number one in the business travel news annual airline survey. This is the first time BTN voters who manage tens of billions of dollars in annual travel spend have selected the same airline for five years in a row. We continue to invest in our ability to upsell on Delta.com which is driving our ancillary revenue growth. We have strong momentum with our plant to make our products available to all Delta customers with the recent introduction at Delta Comfort+ as a fair product and our first mover branded fares launch with Expedia. Sales of Comfort + increased nearly 60% to $125 million in the quarter and we see significant opportunity head now that we have started selling the product as a separate fare class. First class upsell increased 20% driven by a six point paid load factor improvement. Our agreement with American Express produced over $100 million in incremental value again this quarter and more than $400 million in incremental value for the year. For the December quarter, our past year unit revenues declined 1.6% as our winter capacity actions and holiday demand strength offset foreign currency and domestic yield headwinds. This result was better than our initial guide due to stronger demand than we had anticipated during the peak holiday season. Domestic unit revenues declined approximately one point as the yield environment remains competitive, similar to what we have been experiencing for most of the year. Overall, the domestic business is performing well. We have remained focused on expanding service in higher margin areas within our network such as New York, Seattle and Los Angeles which is also contributing to our RASM premium to our competitors. Atlanta also performed well with domestic RASM outpacing the system average despite competitive capacity growth in our largest hub. Our international business continues to face headwinds from foreign exchange and lower fuel surcharges and we are seeing the benefits of the capacity reductions we have made in our performance. The TransAtlantic entity saw unit revenues decline four points entirely driven by FX and surcharges. The Paris attacks caused a 0.5 point reduction in our Atlantic RASM in the quarter roughly $10 million impact. Core European market demand held up reasonably well in the quarter and the capacity actions we had implemented in Africa, the Middle East and Russia helped results. Our joint venture with Air France, KLM and Virgin Atlantic continued to see margin expansion despite currency pressures and increased competitive capacity. In Latin America our unit revenues were down 7 points due to currency primarily in Brazil. Our capacity growth in the region was flat, and we are focussing growth on bright spots like Mexico and the Caribbean while reducing capacity and challenging markets like Brazil. During the quarter, we announced our intent to increase our stake in Aeromexico to upto 49%. We expect to close that transaction during the June quarter. This investment will bring the companies closer and allow us to participate in the financial improvements the Aeromexico team can deliver going forward, in addition to the benefits we realized from our commercial partnership. In the Pacific, unit revenues declined 3%, a solid improvement from where we were turning earlier in the year helped by our significant network restructuring. Currency and fuel surcharges were at 13 point drag on unit revenue in the quarter. Pacific profitability improved again with margins up by 3 points this quarter. Now turning to the first quarter of 2016, we will continue to leverage those opportunities with the greatest profit potential in our network while adjusting capacity in challenging regions. We currently expect capacity growth of 2% to 3% for the first quarter and 0% to 2% for the full year. Remember that our first quarter capacity includes one point of growth from leap day. We are planning for roughly 4% to 5% in the domestic region in the first quarter and 1% to 3% growth for the full year in line with how we see demand and economic growth in the U.S. Domestic growth will come predominantly from higher gauge and targeting those markets where our past investments are allowing us to drive revenue and margin improvements. Our margin and accretive upgauging actions will continue as we\u2019ll take out an additional 40, 50 seaters in 2016 while adding seats to 23% of our narrow body fleet. International capacity will decline 2% to 3% this quarter as the large reductions we made during the fourth quarter in places like Japan, Brazil, Russia and the Middle East remain in place. For the year we expect our international capacity to be flat to down two points. Domestically the demand environment remains solid, although we continue to see yield pressure during the off-peak parts of the quarter, primarily in January and early February. This trend is consistent with what we have seen in the domestic entity over the last six months. Internationally, we expect the currency headwinds we\u2019ve experienced in the December quarter to persist at similar levels in the March quarter but begin to improve thereafter. In addition, we have seen further surcharge reductions through Q4 as fuel prices move lower. Broader Europe continues to see an impact following the events in Paris in November and we have slowed our capacity growth into the region. We expect this will be roughly half a point headwind for system unit revenue for the quarter. In the Pacific, we expect to see good improvement in profitability again in 2016 as we reallocate additional capacity from Japan to growth markets primarily China important pillar of our Pacific and overall company long term strategy. We\u2019ll also benefit from down gauging efforts in the Pacific and will retire the nine remaining 747s in our fleet by the end of next year. We expect overall system unit revenues to decline 2.5% to 4.5% for the March quarter, which includes a 1.5 points headwind from currency. We expect the off-peak periods of January and February to be more challenging than March when we\u2019ll benefit from Easter and Spring break. We expect unit revenue trends to stabilize this summer, while lower fuel prices have resulted in RASM declines for longer than we initially expected, we are getting significantly larger cost savings from fuel that are driving strong margin and cash flow improvements. And as a result we expect a record first quarter with an operating margin of 18% to 20%, roughly 10 point improvement from the prior first quarter. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Paul to go through the details on cost and cash flow. Paul Jacobson : Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everybody. I appreciate you joining us today. I will start by highlighting another strong cost performance by the Delta team this quarter. Lower fuel prices and strong cost controls contributed to a roughly $570 million decline in total operating expenses, despite nearly $120 million in higher profit share. Non operating expenses declined by $9 million even with the $75 million loss associated with the write off of our remaining Venezuelan currency exposure which was included in our results. Non-fuel CASM increased 1.9% on flat capacity including about a point of pressure from the pay raises we implemented in early December. That was offset by a little more than a point due to the currency benefits on the expense lines. As we have said previously, we have built a good foundation for cost productivity and we will continue to benefit from several of our ongoing initiatives including upgauging for several more years. Modifications on 20% of the fleet as Ed mentioned during the early innings including on the 757s, the A320s, the A319s and the CRJ700s. You should remember that in conjunction with the December first wage increase from most of our employees we made a change to our profit sharing plan which affects our CASM due to the geography shift. Given the timing of those increases in 2015, our core cost growth will be more weighted towards the front half of 2016. We expect non fuel CASM including profit sharing to increase roughly 5% for the first quarter with about approximately half of that growth driven by year-over-year profit sharing. For the fourth quarter, our total fuel expense declined by over $700 million driven by lower market fuel prices which was net of $340 million in hedge losses including early settlements. Our all in fuel price was $1.85 per gallon down 30% from the prior year. The refinery contributed $8 million this quarter versus $105 million in the same period in 2014. The decline was primarily driven by considerably lower distillate cracks which are of a substantial benefit to the airline but a headwind for the refinery. We currently expect our March quarter fuel expense to be $1.5 billion lower year-over-year due to the significantly lower hedge losses and the continued decline in market fuel prices. For the full year we expect our fuel expense will be $3 billion lower than 2015 and we are forecasting an all in first quarter fuel price of $1.20 to $1.25 based on last week\u2019s prices. As a result of the uncertainty in the markets we have closed out our hedge book and have full participation to further downward movements in 2016. For the full year we expect our hedge losses to be in the $100 million to $200 million range per quarter or throughout the year. Moving onto cash flow, we are using our strong cash generation to appropriately balance the investments we are making in the business for the long term while also de-risking the balance sheet. Also we are increasing our returns to our shareholders. This quarter we generated $1.4 billion of operating cash flow, just over $1 billion of which we reinvested into the business including six slot pairs at London's Heathrow Airport, as well as aircraft acquisitions and continued fleet modifications. For the first quarter we expect capital spending to again be roughly $1billion. For the full year, we expect our core CapEx to be approximately $3 billion with a little bit higher in the first half of the year primarily due to the timing of aircraft spend. During the quarter, we returned $530 million to shareholders and expect to return a similar level of cash to our owners during the first quarter. For 2015 full year we returned $2.6 billion which equates to approximately 7% of our market cap. $360 million was paid in the form of dividends with the remaining $2.2 billion returned through repurchases. Specifically, we bought back a total of 48 million shares of our stock at an average price of $45.50. Adjusted net debt at the end of December was $6.7 billion. Debt reduction was the biggest driver of $35 million in lower interest expense for the quarter relative to last year and $170 million below 2014 levels for the full year. Additionally, our pension liability decline by $1.3 billion as a result of a 50 basis points increase in the discount rate, we remained committed to behaving as a high value, cash return focus, investment grade company going forward and we\u2019re optimistic that an investment grade rating is insight this year. In closing, I\u2019d like to echo Richard and Ed\u2019s comment and than the entire Delta team for another record 2015. These results don\u2019t come easy. They come through hard work and we look forward to celebrating with them next month. Thank you. Jill? Jill Sullivan Greer : Kelly Ann, that\u2019s going to wrap up our prepared remarks and we are ready for Q&A, if you could give the instructions to the queue. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll hear first today from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Michael Linenberg : Hey, and good morning everybody. Two questions here. Just if I go back on a month, the guidance for the other revs look like it was coming in about $1.5 billion. The print was closer to $1.4 billion. Is there anything in there that we should be aware of maybe why it came in a little bit lighter? Gary Chase : Mike, its Gary. Michael Linenberg : Hey, Gary. Gary Chase : There\u2019s rounding in there. Big drive difference forecast to forecast third party refinery sales. There is no margin in there. So there is no conclusion. Jill Sullivan Greer : And there was an offsetting benefit in the ancillary guidance as well Mike. Michael Linenberg : Okay, great. Thanks Gary. Thanks, Jill. And then, just a second question, we\u2019ve had to deal with these present headwinds as it related to fuel surcharges. And I think at the last time I looked at like the U.S. Japan market, it look like that we were moving towards the lower band as it relates to fuel surcharges given this further decline in fuel it would seem that in many of the fares we must be getting close to a zero fuel surcharge in the fare. Is that right? Is this fuel surcharge issue? Is this the fuel price to stay where they are? Are we going to even be dealing with this, three to six months out? Glen Hauenstein : Sorry, Mike, it\u2019s Glen. We are adjusting based on the fuel and of course in Japan it is a formulaic. Sometimes we are -- in the past we\u2019ve been able to roll that surcharge best peers [ph] as they\u2019ve change, but I\u2019m not predicting what the future is, what we want to comment and how we think that will roll out in future. Michael Linenberg : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll hear next from Julie Yates from Credit Suisse. Julie Yates : Good morning. Richard Anderson : Hi, Julie. Julie Yates : As you reiterated that your revenue trend should stabilize by this summer, but with crude down another 25% since your Investor Day, how should we think about the goal to return to flat to positive PRASM by summer, we saw this push out last year when crude took another leg down from when you initially gave that goal, this is the most recent collapse in crude impair your confidence at all in the timing of that trajectory? Richard Anderson : Hi, Julie. Yes, it certainly push additional pressure on getting to a positive RASM result and we made those comments this morning based on where the four sit today, but clearly crude were to fall another 15%, 20% and some people are calling for over the next few month that will put incremental pressure. These are good trades and we\u2019re happy about crude continuing to fall, but we want to make sure our investor base understands that we appreciate the importance of getting the positive RASM and we\u2019re certainly doing through the network actions, pricing actions, what we can to get the revenue line about the water line. Julie Yates : Make sense. Thank you. And then, Paul one for you perhaps. Just on CASM next guide for Q1, 5% took some by surprise, I appreciate the dynamics on profit sharing and the two raises for the non-union employees, but perhaps if you can walk us through just how the trajectory should look as the year progresses to get you to that guidance of sub 2%? Paul Jacobson : Good morning Julie. Thanks for the question. Clearly, you highlighted the biggest drivers in the first quarter and as I mentioned in the prepared remarks the core CASM is weighted more towards the front half of the year as a result of the fact they were lapping those two increases in the first quarter. So, we\u2019re going to continue to manage it. We feel good about it as we head into and through 2016. Julie Yates : Okay. Can you give us the CASM-Ex number for Q1 excluding profit sharing as you\u2019d express in the past? Paul Jacobson : Yes. We said it, it was about half, half of the five was due to core half of due to profit sharing. Julie Yates : Okay, great. Thanks guys. Operator : From Morgan Stanley we\u2019ll hear from Rajeev Lalwan. Rajeev Lalwan : Hi. Thanks for the question. Just in terms of thinking about capital allocation for the rest of the year, I mean, things like PRASM moving in the right direct. Fuel is coming down. I guess whereas the incremental cash flow go and then kind of related to that it seems like you\u2019re not increasing by the actual quarter year-over-year if I heard you correctly, so just some color there would be great? Richard Anderson : Yes. This is Richard. We have a bias to holding our core CapEx at around the 3 billion number, and the reason why is \u2013 that is really the optimum number that we can execute on a given 12-month period and have a high confidence of delivering the benefits on the time line we lay out. So that really is linchpin to our capital allocation strategy. We do believe that we\u2019re going to have substantially better operating cash flows because low fuel prices is very good for our business overall. We have a bias toward applying that to share buyback. So, I think its reasonable to expect just as we said in our prepared remarks that in 2015 we hit nearly 70% of returning our cash to our owners. And I would expect that we would expect that given the performance that we\u2019re on pace to achieve that our share buyback number would be materially higher in 2016 than it was in 2015. Now, also understand that we have \u2013 we\u2019re going to close the Aeromexico transaction, expected to close in the first half of the year which will drive about $800 million of cash, but that will a quick and immediate return as our investment in Virgin did. So, core CapEx at 3. We have the Aeromexico investment coming, but longer term our bias is to put the money in share buyback. Rajeev Lalwan : Great. And then just on the topic of fuel I think maybe Ed made the comment before retaining 50% to 75% or so on the savings, can you just talk about what data points we should look for to see where that in fact shakes out and what pushes you above it or below it, and specific items that we should look for throughout the year? Richard Anderson : Hi. Your question is in relation to how we\u2019re doing with recapturing the full savings. Rajeev Lalwan : Yes. I mean, just throughout the year what we look for to say, at the end of the year Delta was able to keep 75% of it or 100% of it or we should we focus on capacity or surcharges? Paul Jacobson : For us it was really simple in Q4. Our revenues were roughly \u2013 excuse me, our capacity was roughly flat. Our revenues were down about two points, but that was almost entirely due to the FX impacts on the international. So, by definition we drove all the recovery of savings to fuel to the bottom line or certainly the vast majority of it. As fuel continues to decline that continue to put some incremental pressure on it, but the pricing environment where we stand today is allowing us to do that because we\u2019ve taken some pretty aggressive network actions to accommodate. Rajeev Lalwan : Great. Thank you. Richard Anderson : Maybe one other way to think about this is if you look at full year 2015 results and we expect to be able to repeat this at least this performance in 2016. In 2015, our operating revenues were up 1%, so top-line was up 1%. Our fuel expenses were down 20%, and our EPS was up 38%. We took a lot of that to the bottom line. That \u2013 it means it\u2019s pretty remarkable that our top-line went up 1% in 2015, and we were able to take 20% which was 2.2 and this is after fuel hedge losses. We took 2.286 lower fuels and produced a 38% improvement in EPS. Rajeev Lalwan : Great. Thank you gentlemen. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Jamie Baker : Hey, good morning everybody. Question for Paul. You gave a lower Q1 up margin guide at Investor Day but there wasn\u2019t lot of clarity as to what assumptions you were baking in at that time other then fuel coming down. Were there any other revisions to your forecast specifically incrementally better or worst on the revenue outlook? Ed Bastian : Hi, Jamie, this is Ed. Jamie Baker : Hi, Ed. Ed Bastian : We did as you know; we closed December revenues with a little stronger momentum than we were anticipating in the guide and we see that continuing into the first quarter, so, its combination of lower fuel and certainly or marginally improved revenue. Jamie Baker : Okay. Second question, operations related. The general rule of thump that I\u2019ve used at least for the industry is that it takes about four months between deciding to adjust ones capacity and actually beginning to fly the new schedule. And I\u2019m wondering obviously the booking curve is going to influence this, but in the case of Delta have you gotten any more adept at making substantive schedule revisions in even less time or is four months give or take still a reasonable assumption to use? Glen Hauenstein : Jamie, it\u2019s Glen. Jamie Baker : Hi, Glen. Glen Hauenstein : It depends on the circumstance. In the case of the Paris attacks we started making substantial changes to Brussels and Paris capacity within a week or so. So, I think it really depends on severity and whether or not we believe that we would generate cash by flying it or not generate it. We\u2019re able to park the airplane at any point in time, so if you were looking at \u2013 I don\u2019t think its ever been four months, I think its probably three months at the outside for just a general slight bias up or down, but on specific actions relating to big changes in demand I think we can do that pretty much real time. Jamie Baker : Okay. Richard Anderson : Yes. This is Richard. Let me give the case in point, which is the pilot shortage at the regional. The pilot shortage at the regionals, we adjust that weekly. And bottom line is you can do a pretty dramatic schedule change in 30 days. Jamie Baker : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. We\u2019re obviously taking lot of recessionary type questions these days, so it\u2019s good to be able to know the speed with which you are could potentially, but hopefully it won\u2019t have to react. So thank you very much gentlemen. Take care. Richard Anderson : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll hear next from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey, thanks. Just to follow-up on Jamie\u2019s question. I wonder if you could just tell us a little bit specifically about what your business is telling you about the U.S. economy, obviously there\u2019s a lot of fear out there for folks to look at other sectors in transports, but as you measure it what is your business telling you about the health of the U.S. economy today versus maybe 30, 60, 90 days ago? Richard Anderson : Hey, Duane. We\u2019re pretty optimistic relative to what you read on CNBC or Wall Street Journal or some of the thunders out there that are predicting the future. We are booked ahead in terms of load factor for each of the months for February, March, April and really add into early summer, in case of early summer, its little bit early to call that, but we see demand is very strong and I think one of the issues that we\u2019ve talked to our investors about is that dividend or that the American consumer has gotten from lower fuel whether or not its heating their home or whether or not its filling up their car with gas and where they\u2019re reinvesting and they seem to be willing to reinvest that into Airline purchases, but at slightly low fares and those lower fares are being generated by the lower price of fuel, but core demand strength seems very strong in terms of corporate and core demand strength in terms of leisure seems strong as well for as far as we can see in the next 30, 60, 90 days. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thanks one for that. Ed Bastian : Duane, this is Ed. Let me add to that, because we also see as I\u2019ve said in the remarks, continued strength in corporate demand. Our corporate demand in the fourth quarter was up 3% across the Board. Obviously, internationally it was down a bit in Europe given some of the effects of the Paris attacks. But broadly speaking our corporates continue to tell us that they expect growth in 2016 over 2015 level. So I think this really gets down to a question if the volumes are there, we flew the Christmas season and the Thanksgiving season with some of the strongest load factors in our history. And people translate that into what it means with revenue, there is certainly pricing pressure out there from the fact that fuel prices are half of what they were a year ago, but our yield to run average were down about 4% in the quarter, so both of that fall into the bottom line and our business looks pretty healthy. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thanks for that detail. And then just on a follow-up here, the language about core CapEx of $3 billion. I just want to check does that mean excluding strategic acquisition like Aeromexico or what would be the difference between core and non-core CapEx? And thanks for taking my question. Richard Anderson : That\u2019s right. Ed Bastian : That\u2019s it. Richard Anderson : That\u2019s it. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thank you. Operator : And from Bank of America, Andrew Didora. Andrew Didora : Hi, good morning everyone. I guess kind of follow-up to an earlier question. When you initially gave 2016 capacity of up to do, fuel obviously was 3% higher that it is today. But I know you\u2019ve often said that you do run your business based on a much higher oil price, but if today\u2019s level were to hold for the better part of this year, do you think your thoughts on capacity would change at all? Richard Anderson : It\u2019s the guide we gave you. Andrew Didora : Okay. Fair enough. And then just when I think about your growth here domestically, what are some of the key markets that are you\u2019re looking to add in as oppose to maybe some of the weaker markets you\u2019re looking to kind of move capacity around a bit? Glen Hauenstein : Andrew, hi, its Glen. I think there is really three things we\u2019re concentrating on. One is the continuing up gauge of the airline which we have a lot of great and I think innovative programs in place whether it not identification that Paul talked about or whether it\u2019s the continued retiring of the 50 seat airplane and upgauging the airline more to be a mainline airline. So we have that as a couple of points. And actually the fleet count remains less. When you ask about the commitment and really Jamie asked before what the lower boundary was and we have plenty of space on the lower boundary. What we really plan for the upper boundary in terms of how many airplanes do we have coming in and how many pilots that we hired. That\u2019s really what determine and why we can say with confidence zero to or two, because that\u2019s really running our factories as efficiently as we could. We can always step back from that if the economic conditions changed. But the investments for this year are really and filling everything we\u2019ve started before continuing to get Kennedy to its full 250 departure per day. We think if 250 departure a day since connectivity is expediential that we will really see some aggressive improvements in return in Kennedy as well as Seattle which more and more is relying not only on the Seattle local traffic but on the connectivity that we\u2019re generating through Seattle at this point from the entire Pacific Northwest, so really those are two key linchpins along with upgauging and making our existing hubs more efficient. Andrew Didora : That\u2019s great. Thank you very much. Operator : We\u2019ll move on to Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi Syth : Hey, good morning. Just a couple of questions. The first it is a follow-up on the corporate demands standpoint. I know the shift of volume made sense. It was up about 5% I think in the prior quarter, 3% this quarter. Is that a function of just tougher comps as they kind of the slowing growth there? Or how do you \u2013 how would you kind of rate the somewhat slowdown in the year-over-year growth? Ed Bastian : Savi, this is Ed. It\u2019s really a function that we have put less capacity out. The overall rate of improvement continues at the same level. Savi Syth : That makes sense. And then just a follow-up on the fuel hedge side, I know, its been the kind of the right decision to not hedge here and kind of giving outlook lower, maybe that\u2019s a right thing, but how do you \u2013 any kind of latest thoughts on hedging and maybe what prices if you do hedge today or even about to hedge? Paul Jacobson : Good morning, it\u2019s Paul. You know I would say that what we announced today is really a function of the continued uncertainty and volatility that are in the markets today. We think there will continue to be opportunities out there. We\u2019re still committed to hedging over the longer term, but feel this is the right time to just kind of sit on the sideline and wait it out. Savi Syth : And if you were to hedge Paul, what kind of prices are you going to hedge? Paul Jacobson : Very low. Savi Syth : Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Jill Sullivan Greer : And Kelly, we\u2019re going to have time for one more question from the Analyst. Operator : And that will come from Buckingham Research, Dan McKenzie. Dan McKenzie : Hi. Good morning. Thanks guys for squeezing me in here. Two questions tied to the commercial initiatives. I guess first here with respect to branded fare initiative what percent of the domestic routes are ultimately going to be touched by this once we get to full speed at 2018 and then more importantly how big is the revenue tailwind from curtailing the revenue dilution from business travelers that otherwise might be buying down. Is it worth of half a percentage point of domestic PRASM, one percentage point, any color would be helpful? Richard Anderson : Let me answer the first question first. The first question is we intended to have all four fare products on all markets by 2018, so that was the easy one. The second one is about the dilution of revenue for basic economy from customers that are in the corporate world and what upside that might have. And I would say that is an indirect benefit and we think that\u2019s in that the several hundred million dollar a year range, based on our trial where we are today. Dan McKenzie : Okay. Very good. Secondly, at the Investor Day you guys cited fleet initiatives of course as a key commercial initiative driving margin expansion. I\u2019m just wondering holding still constant how much of the margin improvement came from RJ restructuring in 2015 and as the expectation of that trajectory would be similar in 2016? Paul Jacobson : You know we don\u2019t candidly all the numbers we have on this table in front of me, we actually don\u2019t track that number per se. I think what you have to look it is what the value is that we receive from upgauging and that\u2019s really reflected in our operating margin. Dan McKenzie : Okay. Thanks for the time, guys. Jill Sullivan Greer : And that may conclude the analyst portion of the call. And I am now going to the turn the call over the Kevin Shinkle our Chief Communications Officer for the media portion of the call. Kevin Shinkle : Thanks, Jill. Welcome to the media portion of the portion. We\u2019ll have about 10 minutes for questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. And Kelly Ann, can you please provide the instruction to how to register for a question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll hear first from Jon Ostrower with The Wall Street Journal. Jon Ostrower : Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. Just touching on the announcement from Frontier earlier this month, I\u2019m curious from that perspective where you guys sit on adding a 42 new routes into their network and whether or not that represents any kind of stabilizing force for the U.S. domestic market more broadly and whether or not how you see that competitive challenge facing up or overall capacity as Frontier [ph]? Paul Jacobson : You know, it\u2019s our policy to not comment about our future actions with respect to competitive dynamics in the marketplace. Jon Ostrower : Can you add \u2013 do you believe that the action could represent a force that ultimately strengthen Delta\u2019s position or do you see that more as a path for stabilization or any kind of color just to that move just from the competitive dynamics. Ed Bastian : We have a policy of not commenting upon the competitive \u2013 future competitive dynamics in the market place. Jon Ostrower : Thank you. Ed Bastian : You are welcome. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to Jeffrey Dastin with Thomson Reuters. Jeffrey Dastin : Thank you very much for taking the call. Would you mind saying your thoughts Bombardier's C series and whether Delta is considering a purchase of the aircrafts? Ed Bastian : You know they brought the C-Series to Atlanta right before Christmas and we met with Fred Cromer, President of Bombardier and it\u2019s a pretty impressive airplane. The geared turbofan is the really the first big innovation since the Boeing 787, revolutionized the composite structure for the body the fuselage of the airplane. So, we actually think that at right price it\u2019s quite a competitive airplane particular given the engine technology. So we\u2019re taking a very serious look at it. Jeffrey Dastin : Thank you very much. Operator : And from Flightglobal, Edward Russell. Edward Russell : Hi, yes. I was just wondering if you could elaborate on your plans for LAX, in regarding moving the terminals 1, terminals 2 and terminals 3 there. Are you planning any kind of renovations, rebuilding the terminals, if you can elaborate please? Ed Bastian : Hi. This is Ed. We\u2019re \u2013 as Richard mentioned on a call a week ago, we have entered into a non-binding MOU with LALA [ph] and the board, and at this point in time we are working with the board on hopefully turning that into a binding intent over the next number of months and we\u2019re not really at liberty to comment on that. Edward Russell : Okay, could you please give an idea of the timeline when such a move could take place if you do decide this does happen? Richard Anderson : We\u2019re not at liberty to comment. It\u2019s really up to the commissioners and the Mayor\u2019s office and we appreciate the support we perceive but there\u2019s a long way to go yet. Edward Russell : Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll go to the Philadelphia Inquirer's, Linda Lloyd. Linda Lloyd : Thanks for taking my call. Could you help me understand why the trainer refinery posted an $8 million profit for the quarter when the October earnings call you expected a $30 million fourth quarter profit and a full year profit of $230 million? Thank you. Paul Jacobson : Hi Linda, this is Paul Jacobson. You know primarily its related to the crack spread environment that we see. You know distillate cracks are down which is very very good for the airline since we are a substantial consumer of jet fuel, but the refinery is actually doing a fantastic job in terms of reliability and operational performance. So we are very pleased with the results. Richard Anderson : Yes and the fact, this is Richard. If I could just add something to that. You know we\u2019re really proud to own the trainer refinery; it\u2019s a great group of professional people that operate that refinery. And if you look at the industry data, it is now the top performing refinery in pad 1 in the Northeastern U.S. So it\u2019s a core and critical strategic asset for Delta. Linda Lloyd : Thank you. What was the full year profit for the refinery? Paul Jacobson : Just under $300 million and we paid $150 million for it. Linda Lloyd : So financially it\u2019s working out fine, right. Paul Jacobson : Spectacular. Linda Lloyd : Thank you. Thank you for answering my question. Jill Sullivan Greer : Hey, thank you. Well with that, we\u2019ll conclude our earnings conference call. Thanks to everyone for listening. Operator : Again that will conclude today\u2019s Delta Airlines conference. Thank you all for joining us.",

Welcome to the Delta Air Lines March Quarter 2016 Financial Results Conference. My name is Kelly Ann and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following today's presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Miss. Jill Sullivan Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Jill. Jill Sullivan Greer : Thanks, Kelly Ann. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for our March quarter call. Joining us from Atlanta today are Ed Bastian, our incoming CEO, Glen Hauenstein, our incoming President and Paul Jacobson our CFO. We also have the entire leadership team with us in the room for Q&A. Ed will open the call, Glen will then address our revenue performance, and Paul will follow and discuss cost performance and cash flow. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I'll turn it over to Ed. Ed Bastian : Thanks, Jill. Good morning and thanks to everyone for joining us. This morning we reported a $1.56 billion pre-tax profit, our 12th consecutive record quarterly result as the business continues to benefit from low fuel prices and solid demand. We held our top line roughly flat, and realized substantial fuel savings which allowed us to expand operating margins by nearly 10 points to 18.5% and generate $1.4 billion in operating cash flows. These are nothing short of outstanding results and what is typically our seasonally weakest quarter of the year, where we also saw additional pressure from the tragic events that occurred in Brussels in late March. Operationally, we again led the global industry with a 99.4% completion factor and a non time arrival rate of 86.5%. We have 49 perfect main line completion days and six additional days where the only cancelled flights in our network were to Brussels. It\u2019s now more rare to have a day with the cancellation than not on our mainline product. We also had eight days of no cancellations across the entire Delta system, both mainline and regional carriers what we call brand perfect days and we are focussing more and more on the system level performance and working hard to improve on this basis. With these results, the Delta team proved yet again they are the very best in the industry. I am proud to announce we accrued $272 million in profit sharing this quarter on top of the $23 million in shared rewards they earned. I want to thank the Delta team for a terrific quarter. It\u2019s an honour to be able to lead this great company and serve all of you. I would like to take a moment to thank Richard for his leadership and vision in transforming Delta. Richard has been a great partner and mentor for me for the past decade and while he will be enjoying a well earned retirement, he will always be a trusted friend and advisor and we all benefit from his leadership as the Executive Chairman of our board. Our strategy is working and our team is fully in place. We\u2019ve got Gil West, our Chief Operating Officer who leads the best team of operators in the industry. Glen Hauenstein, our new President has led our network in revenue transformation over the last decade. Steve Sear has taken us to five consecutive business travel news victories as head of our sales organisation, Paul, Joanne, Peter, Kevin the list goes on. Our bench is deep and we are going to keep building on our momentum. While we continue to post record profits, we are very aware that fuel prices remain volatile and have increased nearly 60% from the lows earlier this year. For this reason we are determined to get our business back on the path of positive unit revenues because this is how we ensure that the margins and cash flows that we are producing are sustainable for good times and bad. Glen will be describing our actions along this course. As we look ahead at Delta, we have tremendous momentum in the business while lower for longer fuel prices have added some painful uncertainty to our timeline on getting back to unit revenue growth, they are also driving roughly $3 billion of fuel savings this year and we are committed to pushing as much of that fuel savings to the bottom line as possible. We estimate that we retained 50% of fuel savings in the first quarter on an ex-hedge basis, on a net hedge basis our fuel savings retention was 75%. We are using the cash flow generated by these record earnings to invest in long term profitable growth opportunities for the business improving the balance sheet by paying down debt and funding the pension and continuing to return cash to owners. As we\u2019ve done for the past several years, we plan to update you on our long term plan and capital deployment strategy at our upcoming spring analyst meeting which will be held this year on May 16. I\u2019ve been asked many times over the last couple of months as I take over as CEO as to what my priorities will be as we look to the future. Our goal as a team will be to continue to invest in the initiatives that are producing adorable, sustainable and industry leading foundation at Delta. First, our top priority is running a safe, reliable and customer focussed operation. This is at the very core of what we do and it is producing meaningful improvements in customer satisfaction. It also translates into our industry leading RASM premium and a more efficient cost structure, both of which contribute to more sustainable margins over the long term. Second, is enhancing our brand premium. We said before that our product is not a commodity. In order to earn a premium price from customers, we need to produce a premium product and a brand that drives loyalty. That starts with thoughtful service and reliable operations but also includes consistent innovation across the entire travel experience. Third, you will see us continue on the path towards globalization, whether through initiatives like headquartering our Trans Atlantic operations in Amsterdam, or through our equity stakes in Virgin Atlantic, China, Eastern, Aeromexico and GOL we see the international market place at the source of long term profitable growth opportunities. Our goal is to be the best U.S. global airline. And finally, we\u2019ll maintain the balanced approach for all our stakeholders. Our employees, our owners and the customers and communities we serve share in Delta\u2019s success. This strategy has driven tremendous value for all our stakeholders amidst the foundation for sustainable performance over the long term. I am excited about the future of Delta Airlines and honoured to lead the very best team of airline professionals in the world. I thank our investors for the trust they place in us and assure you we are working hard to be great stewards of your investment. With that, I\u2019m happy to turn the call over to my good friend, Glen Hauenstein. Glen Hauenstein : Thank you, Ed and good morning everyone. I would like to start by expressing my deep gratitude to the Delta team for all of their hard work. Taking great care of our customers everyday has resulted in another record quarterly performance. I am honoured and humble to be taking on the role of President at this very exciting time for our company. There are enormous opportunities ahead for our business and I look forward to driving our continued success together. Our revenues for the quarter were roughly flat to last year, including $125 million headwind from currency and a $5 million impact from the recent events in Brussels. We also maintain our top line performance despite a 40% decline in market field prices. Our corporate demand remains solid with volume growth of 2% this quarter, so our increases across most sectors including healthcare, financial services and technology, however the improvement in volumes is being more than offset by lower yields. The outlook for corporate demand remains favourable with 82% of respondents to our latest corporate travel manager survey rejecting their overall travel spend will be maintained or increased for the rest of the year. This is consistent with outlooks from previous surveys. We continue to see good performance with our branded fare initiatives. Total merchandising revenues grew over 30% for the quarter led by Comfort+ growth at 45% and first class revenue growth of 12%. Basic economy drove roughly $20 million in incremental revenue and we began our broad city level expansion initiative during the quarter. Our partnership with American Express produced $80 million in incremental value this quarter and we expect $265 million in incremental value for the year. Year-to-date new card acquisitions are at record levels and up substancially from 2015. Spend on our cards is up double digits. We continue to work with our great partners at AmEx to produce innovative program offerings for our customers and continue to grow our portfolio. Our passenger unit revenues declined 4.6% with roughly two points of the decline attributable to currency. This result was at the low end of our initial guidance as we continued to see choppiness in the domestic gross and yield environment during the quarter. Focussing on our domestic business, unit revenues declined 5% on 6% more capacity with one point of that growth attributable to leap day. All of our domestic hubs improved margins in the quarter with the best performances in Salt Lake City, Atlanta and Minneapolis. Our investments in markets like New York and Seattle are continuing to pay off as we drove margin expansion in excess of the domestic average in both of these cities. Our international business is still facing headwinds from foreign exchange and lower fuel surcharges as well as economic and geopolitical challenges in certain regions, all of which we continue to address with capacity actions. The TransAtlantic entity saw unit revenue decline at 6% on a 3.5% reduction in capacity, driven by a four point\u2019s headwind from currency and pressure on yields as industry capacity grew in the high single digits during the normally slow season. In our core European markets, U.S. point of sale demand was strong and recovered quickly following the events in Brussels. On the flip side, European point of sales America has been softer largely due to the weaker euro. We are pleased with our performance in London and we continue to benefit from a deeper integration with Virgin Atlantic and the network changes we made together in 2015. Paris unit revenues improved year-over-year as travel to the region rebounded following the events of last November. In Latin America, unit revenues were down 9% with 5% of the decline attributable to currency, largely driven by the Brazilian real. Mexico and Caribbean markets performed well during the quarter and have remained resilient throughout the peak spring travel period. Weaker related cancellations had a very small impact on Latin America. Our Brazil capacity has been reduced by nearly 30% from peak levels while our modest capacity growth has been well absorbed in Mexico and the Caribbean. In the Pacific, RASM declines are moderated with the unit revenues down 5% including roughly 8 points of impact from FX and fuel surcharges. The Yen was a $35 million headwind in the quarter, $30 million of which was driven by a lower year-over-year hedge case. While the recent appreciation of the yen is a positive for our business we will see roughly a four point headwind to Trans-Pacific RASM from lower hedge gains through the remainder of the year. Capacity to the Pacific declined 9% this quarter, primarily driven by Japan. This is part of our continuing Pacific restructuring which includes the ongoing retirement of our 747 fleet. Our China business continues to mature as do our partnerships with China Eastern and China Southern. Today, between 15% and 20% of our customers are travelling beyond Shanghai and Beijing through our partners networks. We expect that number to steadily increase overtime. Demand in China and the broader Pacific held up well for the first quarter although yields remained under pressure due to high levels of industry capacity growth in the region. Looking ahead we are forecasting that second quarter unit revenues will be down 2.5% to 4.5%. The sequential improvement from our first quarter revenue results, on a 2% year-on-year capacity increase. While we are not there yet, we understand the importance of getting back to positive revenue. Volatility and closer yields and challenges in Europe may mean we achieve our goal a few months later than we previously had expected, but we continued to target reaching the inflection point this year. We have a good line of safety getting there in domestic occurrence encouraged by the recent yield trends which are now beginning to turn positive after being down for roughly a year. In addition to our domestic capacity, in addition our domestic capacity growth moderates with each successive quarter during the year. In Latin and the Pacific, our capacity actions and restructuring efforts will continue to benefit us, while currency headwinds are also easing. We continue to expect yield revenues to inflect in both entities in the summer time frame. In the Trans-Atlantic which accounts for 15% to 20% of our revenues is where we have the greatest challenge. Yields remained under pressure as industry capacity growth continues to outstrip demand. Peak season volumes from U.S. to Europe remained very strong and will drive record profits this summer giving a lot of fuel prices. And one positive is that we will get a big help from currency in returns from the headwinds into a tailwind beginning in the next quarter. In closing, I would like to reiterate that we are focussed on taking the necessary actions to get the positive RASM in 2016 and ahead of our network competitors, if for no other reason than to get Ed off my back. We will have a line of say to achieving our goal in domestic, the Pacific and Latin America in addressing the headwinds we face in Europe and we will add quickly to move all the levers in our business including capacity if we do not see sufficient progress in the coming months. With that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to my good friend Paul. Paul Jacobson : Thanks, Glen, and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. While lower fuel cost are providing huge benefits for our business, there is a lot of uncertainty in the global environment and we know fuel won\u2019t stay low permanently. As a result, we remained focussed on staying disciplined with our cost. Total operating expenses for the quarter however were down more than $1 billion as this decline in fuel cost offset wage increases as well as higher profit sharing expense which doubled versus last year at this quarter. Non-fuel CASM increased 4.5% including profit sharing, better than our initial expectation with roughly half of that increase coming from higher profit sharing in the quarter. As you may recall, our cost growth is more weighted towards the front half of the year given the timing of last year\u2019s wage increases and this quarter is the peak. During the quarter, we retired ten older main line aircraft including nine 757 and one 767-300 we removed six 50 seaters from our schedule also during the quarter. We continue to expect our re-fleeting efforts to drive another $350 million of savings in 2016. Our maintenance initiatives benefited us by $90 million in the quarter and we continue to target a $400 million benefit for the full year. For the second quarter we expect non fuel CASM including profit sharing to increase roughly 2% as our productivity and other cost of initiatives help offset higher wages and product and service investments. CASM growth in the second quarter will be well below 1Q levels as we -- last years April 1st wage increase. We remain on track to keep non fuel cost ex-profit sharing below 2% for the full year. Moving onto fuel, our total fuel expense declined by $1.5 billion due to lower market fuel prices and lower year-over-year hedge losses. Our all in fuel price was $1.33 per gallon down 55% from the prior year. The refinery lost a modest $28 million in the quarter while lower crack spreads are a headwind for the refinery they are obviously a significant net benefit for Delta as a whole. Looking ahead we expect an all end June quarter fuel price of $1.48 to $1.53 which is down 40% from prior year. We continue to have no open hedges going forward and anticipate hedge losses of approximately $200 million in each of the remaining quarters this year. With the combination of the fuel tail wind, our non fuel cost disciple and the sequential improvement in RASM performance Glen discussed we expect another record quarter in June with an operating margin of 21% to 23% a roughly 5 point improvement from the prior year. On cash flow, we are using our strong cash generation to appropriately balance the long term investments we are making in the business while continuing to return cash to our owners and de-risking the balance sheet. As Ed mentioned, we generated $1.35 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter. This was net of $1.5 billion in profit sharing pay-offs to employees for 2015 and $825 million cash contribution to the pension plan. We also contributed $350 million in Delta stock during to the pension during the quarter. With the additional $100 million in cash we put in the plans this month, we have contributed $1.3 billion in cash and stocks since the beginning of the year. This completes our funding for 2016. We reinvested $870 million back into the business during the quarter. As you may recall we expect higher capital spending in the first half of the year due to the timing of aircraft spend and will spend roughly $1 billion again in the second quarter. Additionally, this year we expect our Aeromexico tender offer to close in the third quarter. In the March quarter, we returned $880 million to shareholders including the $350 million accelerated share repurchase we completed to offset the dilution from the contribution to the pension plan. Adjusted net debt at the end of March was $7 billion, up slightly from year end due to the timing of cash flows including pension funding and profit sharing. And the decision we made to stay on track for a run rate for buy backs during the quarter. We expect our adjusted net debt to be below $6 billion by year end with our cash flow. We\u2019ve made significant progress on de-levering our business over the last decade and we are pleased to have this recognized with an upgrade by Moody\u2019s to investment grade during the quarter. In closing, I\u2019d like to thank and congratulate the entire Delta team not only for another record quarter but also for achieving our long held goal of returning as an investment grade company. These accomplishments would not have been possible without your determination, dedication and hard work each and every day. Jill, back to you. Jill Sullivan Greer : Kelly Ann, we are now ready for questions from the analysts, if you could give instructions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll move first to Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for the time. Ed Bastian : Good morning, Duane. Duane Pfennigwerth : As we look towards the inflection to positive revenue later this year and you touched on some of this, can you just expand your thoughts on kind of domestic versus international? And which international region you might expect that first, specifically Latin America there's been a lot of capacity cuts. Are you any more instructive on getting back to positive unit revenue in that region? Glen Hauenstein : Duane, this is Glen. I think we are very constructive because the not only do we have some positive chutes in Brazil, both first time in many years our close in bookings have actually provided positive momentum as it closed to -- negative momentum. We are coming off of a very low base in Brazil and as we start to lapse the currency changes I think we are pushing well with the capacity down towards and inflection point later this year. Duane Pfennigwerth : And so would that be your guess in terms of getting back deposit RASM first? Glen Hauenstein : No. I think we are already in positive RASM to already in some of our entities including Mexico now in Japan and domestic I think we have a good line of site for peak summer. So I think we have a lot of the network that\u2019s doing better, that\u2019s being also advised some very dramatic decreases in certain geographic areas including Brazil. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thanks for that color. And then, Paul, could you update us on your latest thinking regarding CapEx for this year and next? How do we think about your narrow body re-fleeting needs relative to kind of that $3 billion core CapEx level that you've outlined? Paul Jacobson : Good morning, Duane. I think as we've talked about we're looking at balancing capital against our cash flows and approximately $3 billion remains our goal. We've got needs over the next five to seven years as we think about older narrow bodies, particularly MD-88s and we remained committed to doing that while achieving our EPS goals, achieving our cash flow goal and our balanced capital allocation. Ed Bastian : Good morning. This is Ed. Let me add a little more to Paul's comments. Our 2016 CapEx guidance remains in line with what we gave you an expectations, there's no changes there. We are in good shape as we look out on our international wide bodies, so there's nothing on that horizon that's changing. The focus we're in the midst of currently is the domestic fleet renewal over the next five years. It's not a short-term need. It's a medium term need, because MD-88s do need to retire. We have roughly 115 of them currently. And we also need to continue to up gauge our regional flying to the main line which we've had a lot of success in and there is much more to go. And I think we can do it cost effectively. There's been a lot of media reports. We have nothing to report at this time. There are no decisions taken, so I will not comment on any media reports. What I do hope is that we'll have more information to report and give you that medium term outlook when we meet together next month in New York at the Spring Analyst Meeting, but the one thing you can remain convinced of here at Deltas that we will stay disciplined on capital deployment as always. That will never change. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thanks very much. Operator : We'll hear next from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi Syth : Hey, good morning. Ed Bastian : Good morning. Savi Syth : Just on the domestic capacity, I know in the first quarter you had the increased related to the extra day, but its still about 5.5%, 6% and then if you look at second quarter and I might be reading the schedules wrong, but it showing maybe 4 to 5. So I was wondering does that -- are you still kind of thinking 1% to 3% growth for domestic market in which case maybe second half did you see in the growth is like 1% to 2%. Is that the still the thinking? Ed Bastian : That is still the thinking and we do deceleration of that growth throughout the year. Thanks to Gil and the team one of the other good benefits we have in the first quarter with a much higher completion factor than we have preview. That was included in the higher number of spend for this quarter as well as the Leap Day. So we do see that number decelerating throughout the year. Savi Syth : Understood. And then just on the fleet question, Just wondering if you're still finding attractive rates for aircraft to part out and even in midlife aircraft replacement or as you look to your narrow value replacement, are you focusing more on newer aircraft to kind of keep that barbell average age going? Ed Bastian : Savi, as we said, we have nothing to report on any speculation in the media and we'll wait till we have something to tell, so we can layout what we're doing. But yes, absolutely, we continue to see good opportunities in the part out space and Gill and his team have created a new entity called Delta Material Services where we're going in and saving literally hundreds of millions of dollars in our tech ops and maintenance cost. Savi Syth : All right. Great. Thank you. Operator : And from Cowan & Company we'll move to Helane Becker. Helane Becker : Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody. Thank you for the time. So, I was wondering if you could explain a little more, flush out a little more the trans-Atlantic to comment about over capacity in the market. And I'm asking that within the context of the fact that there are three large JVs that seem to be able to adjust capacity. So, are you seeing other entities outside of the JVs, increase capacity in those part that are you seeing than back selling what you are taking out. So maybe you could just kind of flush that out a little more for me? Glen Hauenstein : Helane, its Glen. One of the big contributors of course are the ME3, because they are included in our trans-Atlantic capacity. So for example here in Atlanta we have Turkish Airline starting non-stop services into Istanbul this spring. We also have Qatar flying from here to Doha this spring. And the Atlanta to Doha market is less people a day, so they're going to need to fill up on some flow. We don't they'll be successful, but those are capacity that we faced here locally that I think describe type of capacity that's in the trans-Atlantic. And on the other side in Europe itself you have some of the growth from the ultra low cost carriers that are attempting now to fly in the trans-Atlantic such as Norwegian, as well as some of the majors like Air Canada. So when you add all that together we get a trans-Atlantic capacity increase is in the high single digit, low double digit through peak summer season given the economic outlook for the United States and for Europe, we think demand will grow in the 4%, 5% range and so there is more capacity can be absorb by the increase in natural demand. Helane Becker : So, just a follow-up on that, are you seeing that pricing being more aggressive in that market and are you concern that if oil prices continue to move up it will pressure margins? Glen Hauenstein : I think those are always are concerns. I think that the demand that is strong particularly ex U.S. and it's been little bit weaker ex Europe. But if these elevated level stay and fuel goes up and economies don't grow, I think that would be an indication that industry would need to full capacity in order to maintain margins. Helane Becker : Okay. Thank you, Glen. I appreciate your help. Glen Hauenstein : Thank you. Operator : We'll move next to Joseph Denardi with Stifel. Joseph Denardi : Thanks. Good morning. Glen, just on the domestic side kind of given the slowdown in capacity expected throughout the year. Where are the investments being made now and what market is going to fund the capacity reduction through the year? Glen Hauenstein : Well, I don't think it's necessarily capacity reduction, but it\u2019s a lapsing of the investments we made last year. So, as we get through the year our capacity in Seattle grew dramatically last year. Our capacity in the Europe grew significantly last year. As we get to that second half of the year those capacity additions start lapping each other. Joseph Denardi : Okay. Thanks. And then Paul, just on some of the deferral and acceleration transactions you've made with the hedge book, I think that's kind of complicated the cash flows this year and into next year, so I'm just wondering if you kind of where the book stands right now, but what the net cash flows and outflows are this year and next? Paul Jacobson : Hey, good morning Joe. What we talked about was if you recall at Investor Day \u2013 I'm sorry on the first quarter call that we had locked out the book that's where we sit right now, our expense recognition mirrors those cash flows. So we would expect about $200 million a quarter. We do have some modest quarterly impact in 2017, but it's rather immaterial, the crux about though is like we said the book remains flat and there is no participation, right now, it just sitting there. Joseph Denardi : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And Jamie Baker with JPMorgan has our next question. Jamie Baker : Hey, good morning everybody. Ed Bastian : Hi, Jamie. Jamie Baker : First one for whoever might want to take it. The second quarter margin guide is healthy, no question about that. But whether or not we include fuel, you know there's traditionally been more improvement from the first quarter to the second, historically for Delta anywhere from call it 500 to 800 basis points. So today's guide is obviously below that range. Shouldn't the consolidated industry be showing a little bit more seasonality, not less as we move into peak periods? Any idea what might be contributing to this? Paul Jacobson : Hey, Jamie, it's Paul. I'll start and let anybody else chime in that wants to. I think when you look at just where we are in this particular quarter to quarter you've got a move in fuel that, if you just look at our mid point of our guide for 2Q against our 1Q actually is moved up almost $200 million for that impact and while RASM is improving sequentially its not keeping up with that pace in the very, very short term. I don't think that's a judgement on consolidation. I think it just on the volatility of where we are. Despite that move in fuel we're sitting roughly at where ended up at year end. So I think there's a little bit of intraquarter noise movement going on with the market generation. Jamie Baker : Okay. That's helpful. Second for Glen, I'm trying to better understand what happened in the last couple of weeks with multisegment, itinerary construction domestically. Its unclear whether or not Delta led the effort, I guess that actually doesn't really matter as much as it seems that the reconstruction is potentially driving firmer RASM on multisegment fares, the type that I would often use if I would jump it around the country on Delta. Can you share any background on this? Glen Hauenstein : Jamie, as always we don't really comment on fares on this call, so I would like to just \u2013 if you have another question we could answer? Jamie Baker : No. But I'll end with this. We are with and believing you should be comped against high quality industrial transports, but you listen to the earnings calls from those companies this quarter or any other, most of them are going talk openly about pricing revenue. So high quality industrial transports don't duck and weave in this topic. So just something I would point out I'll pass to mic somebody else? Glen Hauenstein : Thank you, Jamie. Operator : And from Wolf Research we'll go to Hunter Keay. Hunter Keay : Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Ed, I', curious to know what you expect from Richard as his level of involvement of Chairman, you know, how much is enough, how much is too much I should say and how much is not enough and what are your expecting from him and how much are you guys going to communicate maybe between board meetings? Ed Bastian : Well, Hunter, I don't mean to speak for Richard, but Richard is going to become the Chairman of our Board in a few weeks. And I expect Richard to fulfil the same function enrol that our current Chairman Dan Carp has done very ably for the last seven or eight years. Richard and I obviously very close and we speak a lot. And I would leave it at that. Hunter Keay : Okay. And Glen, does you on time performance give you the opportunity that maybe tighten some blocks times in order to facilitate maybe some more connecting volumes and maybe this question for you or maybe for Paul, maybe for Gil, he is there, but if you do have some potential CASM pressures in the event that you trim some capacity. How much of that can be offset by tightening some of those block times? Thanks for all time. I appreciated. Gil West : This is Gil. Thanks for the question. I mean there's a number of variables that drive on-time. I would argue that execution is biggest of those wholly focused around that. Block time plays a role in it, of course the ground time also play a role. We run the tightest ground times in the industry and we try to bias ground time to the tightest for a number of reasons and block more or less average now with the industry maybe a little bit higher. But we also try to not just blanket block time, we're more surgical about it, I think that's a next level that we continue to drive. But our connections are also a metric and variable that we look at, we run less than a 1% misconnect rate as well, while balancing all of that. Paul Jacobson : And Hunter, this is Paul. I'll just add there. We're not going to degrade the customer experience, put the customer experience at risk in chasing after CASM goal, nor we're going to add capacity to manage cost, capacity is responsibility of the commercial organization to match the demand and where we see that opportunity. CASM has to be driven by productivity and we're going to continue to do that and if we're successful with that its not going to impact the customer, only enhance their experience. Hunter Keay : Thank you very much. Operator : We'll move to next to Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Darryl Genovesi : Hi, everyone. Thanks for the time. Ed Bastian : Hi, Darryl. Darryl Genovesi : Not to be the dead horse on CapEx, but I saw Paul mentioned a $3 billion number and I just wanted to be perfectly clear on one point and is that -- are you recommitting to your $3 billion stated upper limit on CapEx regardless of which way the MD-80 replacement decision goes? Paul Jacobson : Darryl we talked about CapEx for 2016 and long-term we mentioned that we've got some domestic fleet renewal needs and we don't have any updates to that number, but I think you need to wait and to see if we make decision along that line and we'll keep you posted. Darryl Genovesi : Okay. Thanks. And then bigger picture question for Ed or Glen, I appreciate and I'm sure most equity investors on this call probably appreciate your admiral goal of getting back to positive year-over-year unit revenue growth. I guess what I'm less certain of is whether sustain unit revenue growth is actually achievable over the next few years with returns running as high as there across the industry, which to me what appear likely to drive continued at least mid single digit supply growth which is kind of what we've been seeing. So, just wondering and maybe perhaps just focusing on the domestic market assuming the current status flow of kind of low single digit GDP growth, fuel and kind of the low to mid 40s per barrel, and then continued mid single digit, domestic supply growth across the industry, how do you really establish any confidence that, you know, that you can get this sustain unit revenue growth and understandably demand is going to kind of ebb and flow and maybe you can get there for a quarter or two, but just any color on sort of how you can get there and sustain there given the return profile across the industry? Thank you. Glen Hauenstein : You know If you look back over the last several years we had seven years of unit revenue expansion all of by it looks like about two years of contraction. It will be that two years of contraction which were caused really by fuel price being cut in less than half. And I think if you look at the coloration to fuel and unit revenues over time you'll see a very tight coloration in the longer term. So depending on what your fuel assumption is if you see fuel bottoming at $27 in the December time period and then you see a gradual improvement. Although longer, lower for longer I think that ultimately will be reflected in ticket prices and that's one of the reasons I think we're relatively confident that we will get to our unit revenue in the back half of the year than we did in the first half of the year. We coupled that was the foreign exchanges moving from a negative to positive, and I think that shows where we can get to. Back to the domestic arena I do think that most of this decline has been cost by the decrease in fuel. Darryl Genovesi : Okay. Maybe just to play devil's advocate, understanding all the historical metrics that you just laid out, I don't think -- we've really ever seen a period of \u2013 sustain period of time where the Airline industry was putting up a roughly 20% on levered return like it is today, right. So, I think most would agree that's well above the industry's capital and looking across other industries that with that type of excess return would typically lead to outsize growth, right. So I guess I have a little trouble understanding how the industry goes about getting price and how Delta goes about getting price with that kind of return backdrop and the likely supply trends that it would drive? Glen Hauenstein : I just would comment, I think we have the very best revenue team in the business and I think that we are very confident that we have a path forward and there is more revenue for us to garner from particularly corporate as we continue to separate ourselves from the pack in terms of our products and services. And really that's what our futures about; it's about getting pay for the high quality of services that buy in this national transportation network. So, if you spend some time I will walk you through some of the initiatives in more great detail, but we really do thing that we are poised to separate from the pack here. Ed Bastian : And Darryl, this is Ed. Just to what Glen was saying. This is a different business and this is a different company and you also have to keep in to account the level of cash that we're generation and putting back into product and services and producing a product that customers want to buy and investing in segmentation technologies and merchandizing opportunities in corporate volume and volumes have stayed strong throughout this period. So, I'm optimistic we'll continue to produce the results that we talk about and we'll have \u2013 it\u2019s a good question, we'll talk more in the spring meeting about that. Darryl Genovesi : Great. Thanks very much guys. Operator : We'll move next to Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Dan McKenzie : Hey, good morning. Thanks. Looking out this summer, Europe really strikes me as a wild card, the best case scenario under our Brexit looks pretty deem, so I'm guessing the unit revenue outlook for the second quarter doesn't factoring Brexit, but I believe the demand trends were weaken even before the Brussels attack. So I'm wondering if you can provide some additional color about what's factored into the outlook exactly on this entity, so perhaps a trend line of continued decay, and then just remind what percent of the revenue is tied to the U.K. specifically? Glen Hauenstein : U.K. specifically is probably for us less than 3%, but demand trends for the summer demand itself is strong, yields are relatively weak and lot of that was because of the currency devaluation, but now we are lapping that. So as we move forward from this point we should see actually a tailwind from the euro exchange rate. So, your question kind of indicates doom and gloom. We will confidently say that we have record profits in the trans-Atlantic this summer that's with the high degree of confidence that our profits will be at historic highs trans-Atlantic this summer. And as we get to June and as we usually do we'll assess what demand trends we see it for the off season and then we will take the appropriate adjustments if necessary to ensure that we have the right level of capacity in for the fall and winter. Dan McKenzie : That's good color. Thanks, Glen. Following up, the GBTA forecast for corporate travel spends was revised downward this week. So I'm wondering if you can provide some color around this revenue bucket for Delta. Is the spend deteriorated somewhat, or are you expecting spend to perhaps trend a little bit more strongly this year? Just wondering what color you can share along those lines. Ed Bastian : Dan, this is Ed. The GBTA report as I recall, I'd look at quickly the other night indicated that demand continues to grow, volume continues to grow and that's what we're seeing in our corporate space, our volumes were up in Q1 and our forecast through the summer and rest of the year for volumes still continue to grow. I think the numbers that they've revised down was more reflective of the current pricing environment in which fares our lower than were previously anticipated in the closing space. And I think \u2013 but we're not seeing any trend lines to give as pause. Dan McKenzie : Very good. Thanks guys. Operator : From Stephens, we'll hear from Jack Atkins. Jack Atkins : Good morning guys. Thanks for - Glen Hauenstein : Welcome. Jack Atkins : As it relates to rising fuel prices, I was just curious how quickly may you'll be able to pass that through higher fares. What sort of lag before that's reflected RASM? Ed Bastian : Jack, you're breaking up, we're having real hard time hearing your question. Jack Atkins : Sorry about that, is that any better? Ed Bastian : Yes, it is. Jack Atkins : Okay, great. So as it relates to rising fuel prices, I'm curious how quickly you would be able to pass that through via higher PRASM. What sort of lag would you anticipate with as fuel goes up before you'll be able to pass that through via PRASM? Ed Bastian : That's hard to speculate on. Historically there's been a like and I think its anywhere from one to two quarters before RASM and volume adjustments get made to keep track of rising fuel price itself. Current environment is different than anything we've seen before at the same time, so it would be hard to speculate. Jack Atkins : Okay. Then specifically with regard to the second quarter PRASM guide, what sort of FX impact is baked in there? If you could share that, that would be helpful. Glen Hauenstein : I think its one point. Jack Atkins : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And Rajeev Lalwan with Morgan Stanley has our next question. Rajeev Lalwan : Hi, gentlemen, thanks for the time. Just as it relates to the June guide are you assuming the margin environment carries forward? And then just coming back to business travel, have you noticed any changes as far as policy shifts on the corporate side? Ed Bastian : On the policy side, no, we're not seeing any significant shifts. And I'd say the Q2 guide is roughly in line with the trend lines that we closed out the first quarter at. Rajeev Lalwan : Okay. And then just one other quick one, I think Glen you mentioned earlier that you're seeing some encouraging trends on the domestic front; can you just talk a little bit more about what exactly that was and implications for it? Glen Hauenstein : Well, for many months and quarters now we've had advanced domestic yields and as they sit on the books for the out months in negative territory and as we get to summer of this year, peak summer of this year for the first time and quite a while the advanced bookings and advanced yield trends are favourable to the baseline Europe 12 months ago. So, that is optimistic and now we have to do is get through that whole booking cycle all the way down the day of departure and keep in the positive territory. When you're sitting out at 30, 60, 90 days with the minus three or minus four it's harder to make it up inside that. So that's kind of the trajectory we're on and seeing a much more favourable advanced book than we've had in the past. Rajeev Lalwan : Okay. Thanks for the time and congrats on all the new roles. Glen Hauenstein : Thank you. Operator : And from Deutsche Bank, Mike Linenberg. Richa Talwar : Hey, everyone. Its actually Richa Talwar on behalf of Mike. Good morning. Glen Hauenstein : Good morning. Richa Talwar : So first, we would be curious to hear Delta's stance on slot restrictions at Newark airport being lifted in October. Does that represent a growth opportunity for you? And how do you think it will impact the New York market maybe more broadly and fit into your New York strategy? Glen Hauenstein : New York is a very congested area in terms of capabilities, in terms of aerospace and it\u2019s a very complex and incredibly expensive environment to operate in. And so, well, we are enthusiastic about Newark's slot restrictions being lifted. We are also realistic that their airport does not have an infinite number of or infinite capability to handle traffic. So we will examine the options very carefully and see what it is we do to improve our position in Newark, but I don't see a significant amount for us in Newark. Richa Talwar : Okay, great. Thanks. And then second, regarding the financial difficulties your Brazilian Partner is going through, we know GOL has a number of fairly young aircraft that it's looking to restructure with lessons. And it's been reported that Delta is in the market right now, as you've commented multiple times for narrow body jets. So is there a happy harmony on the table where you consider using some of their lift? Is that an outcome you would consider? Or are you really just opting for new aircraft or a different avenue as you consider your replacement needs? Ed Bastian : This is Ed. We are working very closely with our good partners down in Brazil and they are certainly through a reduction of their fleet. We haven't made any decisions yet as to whether there would be some of the aircraft that we would take either through addition into our fleet or to part out opportunities, but we're dialogue with them. We're not the only individuals at the table because there's number of lessors are also talking about sending aircraft back to. Richa Talwar : Okay. Thanks for that color. Jill Sullivan Greer : And we got time for one more question from the analyst. Operator : Okay. That will be from Julie Yates with Credit Suisse. Julie Yates : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Ed Bastian : Good morning, Julie. Julie Yates : Glen, is there any color you can provide geographically on domestic RASM, pockets of strength and weakness? I think last year you called out three specific markets as driving the bulk of the weakness. Is it still a similar story, or was the weakness in Q1 more widespread? Ed Bastian : I would say that we saw a deepening of the number of markets that were impacted by lower close-in-fares. Julie Yates : Okay, great. Can you quantify that just in terms like the number of top 10 markets that are affected or? Ed Bastian : I think what we can do is we can get back to you on that in terms of more specifics, because it is a much more widespread phenomenon than it was. Last year was really just in some key business markets and now it has broader implications. The good news is that the numbers haven't gotten worst so they tend to balance out in demand, but it is different than it was a year ago. Julie Yates : Okay. And then just on the Q2 unit revenue guide of down 2.5% to down 4.5%, what's the underlying assumption for domestic versus international? And I'm curious if the sequential improvement is mostly a function of lapping the international headwinds like FX and surcharges, or if you expect domestic to materially improve from the down 4.8% given the comments you made on advanced bookings? Ed Bastian : As we get through the peak summer we do expect domestic to improve from where we are sitting in March. May maybe a choppy month, but I think June and July will be very solid, and we do get one point reduction or point and a half on the currency headwinds as well. So I think we have some good visibility to peak summer, second quarter isn't the peak for domestic. July is really peak, and that's really where we headed to try and get a positive RASM in domestic, we'll see if we can get there. Julie Yates : Okay, great. Thanks for fitting me in. Glen Hauenstein : Thanks Julie. Jill Sullivan Greer : Thanks, Julie. And that is going to conclude the analyst portion of the call. I'll hand it over to Kevin Shinkle, our Chief Communications Officer. Kevin Shinkle : Welcome everybody. We've about 10 minutes to take questions from journalists, so please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Kelly Anne if you could provide the instruction again on how to register to ask the question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll move to Dennis Schaal with Skift. Dennis Schaal : Hello, everyone. I was wondering if you see any challenges for Delta in Alaska Air's merger with Virgin America? And also, JetBlue announced this week that they are expanding Mint service into Seattle. How will these changes impact Delta? Ed Bastian : Your question was high, I didn't fully hear your question, its high, how does the Alaska/Virgin proposed merger impact Delta? Dennis Schaal : Yes. Yes, as well as JetBlue expanding Mint service into Seattle. Ed Bastian : Seattle we're doing quite well. We continue to grow there. We had a very good margin in the first quarter and I think our outlook is strong there. We're not going to comment on proposed transaction. We'll react when we see what happens in the marketplace. Dennis Schaal : Okay, thanks. Edward Bastian : On the Mint product between Seattle and JFK and Boston, we currently have flatbeds on a single flight between our two flights between New York and Seattle. We had already in the plans to make sure that we had a consistent product in terms of flatbeds seats in key time channels between the two markets. That's not all time channels, but on the red eye, certainly we will have flatbed product in Seattle to New York. Dennis Schaal : Great. Ed Bastian : We hosting our plans before Mint announced this. Dennis Schaal : Got it. The other question was on basic economy. I think you said that it drove $20 million in incremental revenue in the quarter. Are you happy with that number? And are you not seeing significant dilution from passengers who would have otherwise purchased higher fares? Glen Hauenstein : You know basic economy is really design for customers who solely are purchasing on price and I think our value proposition relative to the ultra low cost carriers is very, very strong. We have great customers, great operational reliability, great baggage delivery and we already have a lot of things that on other ultra low cost carriers are not free like. We don't charge for space in overhead bins. So if you're stopping for just solely price we want to have a product that can compete effectively and provide the best services against carriers who are providing a much lower quality of service. And I think that's what this is design for. And what we're seeing is when presented with the options and the really the way we get to the $20 million value is those customers when they were informed of what those product was show something else. And that's really how we get to that $20 million value. Remember it's really only in about 400 to 500 markets, now we have over 20,000 domestic markets. So our plan is over the next weeks and months we continue to roll it out. So we do have a great value proposition for people who are just looking for lowest possible fare. Dennis Schaal : Thanks a lot. Operator : And from the Wall Street Journal we hear from Susan Carey. Susan Carey : Good morning gentlemen. Could you remind what your operating margin was in the end in the first quarter? Paul Jacobson : The first quarter it was 18.5% Susan. Susan Carey : Thank you. And secondly, there's a little tussle going on between the EU and the U.S. and Canada about possibly ending the visa waiver program. Apparently it's not settled yet, but are you thinking ahead to a possible negative impact if U.S. citizens have to apply for visas to go to France or something? Ed Bastian : We're not anticipating that Susan. Susan Carey : You think it will be solved then. Ed Bastian : We don't have enough information, we don't have an informed opinion at this point, so I'd say, we're not making any plans. Susan Carey : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll move next to David Koenig with the Associated Press. David Koenig : Really you answered the question I was going to ask, which was about basic economy. Just one other thing is the entry of American and United into that market this year, how is that going to -- do you expect how that will affect you? Ed Bastian : We really don't have the details yet on what American and United product is, but I think we are consistent in saying whatever that product is, we want to have the best in class for it and we will make adjustments as necessary to make sure that for people who are just travelling on price as the only decision maker that Delta always offers the best product offering. David Koenig : I guess what I\u2019m getting at. Let\u2019s assume for argument sake that American and United do something similar to what you\u2019ve done, you know it doesn\u2019t that you just kind of divide up whatever that market is and might that 20 million in incremental revenue you saw in the first quarter be a high water mark? Ed Bastian : I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case, so we can take that offline and discuss it with you but I think it might be the opposite. David Koenig : Okay. Thanks. Operator : And Michael Sasso with Bloomberg News has our next question. Michael Sasso : Yeah, good morning. Could you just elaborate a little bit on your discussions with GOL particularly you were talking about doing you know maybe taking back some jets from them, what exactly, what are the range of options that Delta is considering regarding GOL and its aircraft. Ed Bastian : Well Michael there is no decisions taken yet because GOL is still working through the impact with its -- and creditors down there but GOL has been public that there is a considerable amount of their capacity that they are reducing. And we as a number of stakeholders in GOL are looking at it whether there are some opportunities to take from used aircraft and either to enter into service and then induct or to part out those opportunities in both spaces. Michael Sasso : Any specific types of aircraft you might look at? Ed Bastian : There are only five 737 so \u2026 Michael Sasso : All right. Operator : And from TheStreet we\u2019ll move to Ted Reed. Ted Reed : Thank you. Glen, did you say that between Atlanta and Doha, there is only five O&D passengers a day, so and I think you said that, so do you have any routes like that. And secondly, do you guys feel there is a resolution coming in this dispute with the mid east carriers? Glen Hauenstein : Well Ted you know I would -- we don\u2019t have any markets that we buy half way across the world, they had less than 10 people and I don\u2019t think you will find many carriers in the world. So I don\u2019t know what the latest is, maybe I\u2019ll turn that over to Peter and he will inform you on what the latest is\u2026 Peter Carter : I will tell you, this is Peter. This is our number one priority in Washington. We have reason to believe that the U.S. government is going to do the right thing and having said that because this is fundamentally a diplomatic process it will take some time. Ted Reed : So nothing came in from the U.S. government? Nothing we are aware of. Peter Carter : Nothing we are aware and Ted we do have some markets that we have four or five passengers and we call that Delta private jets. Ted Reed : All right. Thank you. Peter Carter : Thanks Ted. Operator : And Kelly Yamanouchi with the Atlanta Journal Constitution has our next question. Kelly Yamanouchi : Hi there, I was just interested in finding out how the current environment in your outlook as it stands effective, how does contract negotiations as you go into mediation and any time frame that you might have for reaching a deal there? Ed Bastian : We are not going to comment publicly fairly on the status of the negotiations were. At the table we are working hard, our pilots are the best and we want our pilots to be paid the best and that\u2019s our commitment to them. Kelly Yamanouchi : Okay, thank you. Operator : And from Reuters we\u2019ll move to Jeffrey Dastin. Jeffrey Dastin : Thanks very much. Has Delta considered starting direct flights into China\u2019s interior now that more of its customers are travelling beyond Beijing and Shanghai? Ed Bastian : You know we have some great partners in China with China Eastern and China Southern and similar to how we transfer customers to our European Partners, AFKL and AZ, we think that the next few years is about continuing to develop those primary gateways in Beijing and Shanghai. And as you may know we\u2019ve applied to our new services during this December from Los Angeles to Beijing and that\u2019s going to be our focus for 2016 and 2017 as to our work to get that route and initiate it successfully. Jeffrey Dastin : Thank you. And a brief follow up regarding the region. Does Delta have an update on talks to strengthen its partnership with Korean Air? Ed Bastian : We are always in discussions with our partners to strengthen and Korean Air is no exception. And as the landscape in the Pacific continues to evolve and the geographies change, we think Korean is a very very important partner for our success in that region in the future and I know they feel the same way about Delta. Jeffrey Dastin : Thank you very much. Ed Bastian : And we have time for one more question. Operator : And that will be from Edward Russell with Flightglobal. Edward Russell : Hi yes, could you comment on the Haneda day time slots and does Delta plan to seek all of them if they are available in the proceeding later this year? Ed Bastian : As you may know there are five daylight frequencies available to U.S. carriers. We are in the process of filing our route case and that will become public here in the next couple of week, but before that happens we probably would refrain from commenting on it. Edward Russell : Okay, one follow up. What was the opening -- due to your Narita hub considering your earlier comments on playing down Narita? Ed Bastian : You know we have continued to de-emphasize Narita over the last several years and we will continue on that process. Haneda probably accelerates that process by a little bit as we look through the fall of scheduled period. Edward Russell : Thank you. Ed Bastian : Thank you. And with that we\u2019ll conclude our earnings conference call. Thanks to everyone for listening. Operator : Again, that will conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you all for joining us.",

My name is Kyle and I will be your coordinator. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Jill Sullivan Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jill Sullivan Greer : Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us for our June quarter call. Joining us in Atlanta today are Ed Bastian, our CEO; our President, Glen Hauenstein and our CFO, Paul Jacobson. Ed will open the call. Glen will then address our financial and revenue performance and Paul will conclude with a review of cost performance and cash flow. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up. Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta\u2019s SEC filings. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items, unless otherwise noted. And you can find the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I will turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Ed Bastian. Ed Bastian : Thanks, Jill. Good morning. Thanks to everyone for joining us. For the June quarter, we reported a $1.7 billion pre-tax profit and we generated $1.6 billion in free cash flow. We grew our earnings per share 16% to $1.47 beating consensus by $0.05. Strong cost execution and lower fuel prices allowed us to offset a decline in revenues as we continue to face persistent unit revenue headwinds. In this challenging revenue environment, it\u2019s more important than ever that we differentiate ourselves on service. And in this area, the Delta people have truly risen to the top. We continue to run the industry\u2019s best operation. We delivered a 99.95% completion factor for the June quarter, including 71 of the 90 days with zero mainline cancellations. More importantly, we had 23 days of zero system cancellations on any Delta carrier, nearly 6,000 flights a day or 1 out of every 4 days for the entire quarter. Our mainline on-time rate improved 1.5 points year-over-year to 86.9%. This operational result is contributing to continued solid increases in customer satisfaction. We have achieved all-time highs in our net promoter scores and our customer complaint rate has decreased by 14% so far this year. These high levels of customer satisfaction are widening our revenue lead relative to the industry with our system RASM index reaching 110% as of the March quarter. Congratulations to the entire Delta team and thank you. We recognize your outstanding efforts with another $324 million of crude towards our profit sharing program bringing us to $596 million accrued already this year. Despite our strong results, we continue to face persistent headwinds on our unit revenues on a number of fronts that we are working hard to combat. Capacity is one of the biggest levers we have to move the needle on our unit revenue performance. In May, we announced that we plan to take one point of capacity out of the fourth quarter. That brought our second half capacity growth plan to below 2%. Now, with the foreign currency pressure from the steep drop in the pound, the economic uncertainty from Brexit and continuing yield pressures in the North Atlantic, we have decided to take an additional 6 points of capacity out of the UK for the winter IATA season. We have also been working closely with our partner Virgin Atlantic who will be making their own capacity changes. Combined, our overall UK capacity this winter will be down 2% to 4% compared to the prior year. For Delta, these changes along with other network actions will take roughly 1 point of capacity out of the system and we now expect our fourth quarter capacity to grow by only 1% year-over-year. Glen will take you through the details. But I want to stress to you that the company is very focused on getting back to positive RASM growth. While admittedly, we have done a poor job forecasting when unit revenues will turn positive, we are working hard to achieve our goal hopefully by the end of the year. And even if ultimately it takes a little bit longer than year end, we are confident we are on the right path. We expect July and August monthly RASM results to be weak. However, we are anticipating a market improvement in our September monthly numbers as we implement our capacity changes and see benefits from our domestic revenue management initiatives and easing of foreign exchange headwinds and an improvement in the overall pricing environment as we hit the traditional 9-month period that it takes for revenues to catch up to higher fuel prices that we began experiencing earlier this year. And if we are not seeing the right progress in our results as we moved through the fall, we are prepared to take additional actions as you saw us announced this morning. Because the reality is that the large year-on-year savings driven by lower fuel are now behind us, market prices are essentially flat for the third quarter and look to be higher year-over-year in the fourth quarter for the first time since 2012. All that said, our results for the third quarter should be a record as we expect to generate a pre-tax margin of 20%, consistent with what we posted a year ago. Demonstrating the sustainability of our performance is key to delivering the margin, cash flow and return targets that we outlined for you in May. And as we look to drive that performance longer term for the business, we will continue to execute on the strategy that has already delivered tremendous value for all of our stakeholders. First, we will continue to strengthen our brand around the world. The strong brand improves customer loyalty while driving a sustainable revenue premium and higher margins. Second, we will maintain a rigorous discipline around cost and capital. This provides the solid foundation for the business, day in and day out. With our sustainable revenue premium, a solid cost foundation and modest capacity growth, we have the engine for consistent 15% plus long-term earnings growth. Finally, we will use our strong cash flows to reinvest in the business for the long-term, fortify our balance sheet through debt and pension reductions while also returning at least 70% of our free cash flow to our owners. So to conclude, our second quarter results were strong. However, we need to get unit revenues back on a positive track and Glen and the commercial team are executing on our plan. Longer term, our revenue premium, solid cost base, balance sheet and cash flows provide the foundation for the earnings growth and substantial capital returns for our owners that we believe will drive value long into the future. And with that, I am happy to turn the call now over to Glen. Glen Hauenstein : Thanks, Ed and good morning, everyone. While the overall revenue environment continues to present challenges, we expect to outperform our network peers on unit revenues once again in the second quarter. This is truly a testament to our entire team who continue to provide industry leading revenues by delivering an unparalleled level of reliability and great customer service every day. Turning to our June quarter performance, revenues declined 2% compared to last year, including roughly $65 million of pressure from currency. We continue to see closing domestic yield deterioration on stable corporate ticket volumes producing domestic corporate unit revenue trends that are down in the high single-digits. This pressure, combined with continued foreign currency impacts and supply demand imbalances primarily in the Trans-Atlantic and China regions, drove a 4.9% decline in system passenger revenues. While we faced a number of headwinds in the quarter, the expansions of our ancillary revenue initiative remains a significant positive for us. Our branded fare initiative continues to see strong momentum. Total merchandising revenues for the quarter increased more than $40 million or 13% year-over-year. Comfort+ paid load factory increased by 15 points to 46% as we began selling this product in the purchase path in mid-May. We now expect Comfort+ to generate nearly $300 million of up-sell revenues in the second half of 2016 with further upside in 2017 as we begin the international rollout scheduled to be complete by the end of \u201817. We now have rolled out our basic economy product to over 7,000 domestic markets or about 50% of our domestic revenue base. We anticipate that we will have full domestic coverage sometime in 2017. Our international rollout of this product has begun and we are now testing the product in over 50 international markets. Our intent is to have this in all international markets during the year \u201818. Our partnership with American Express produced $90 million of incremental value in this quarter and we expect over $300 million for the year. New current acquisitions are on a pace for another record year and have increased 30% year-to-date over our record 2015. A special thanks to the SkyMiles and American Express teams for the great success we have had in enrolling new members this year. We have a great partner in American Express and look forward to our continued efforts to provide the leading co-brand offering to our mutual customers. While there are areas of the business that have great momentum, there are others that require additional work. Our entire commercial team has focused on changing the revenue trajectory and getting back to positive RASM by year end. Let me outline for you some of the major initiatives we have underway by region to ensure that we can achieve our goal. Domestically our unit revenues declined 6% on 5% capacity growth for the June quarter and while absolute volumes for business traffic remained solid, quite simply they didn\u2019t keep pace with sales growth. Yields were further pressured as traditional AP and minimum stay requirements were absent in many major U.S. markets. On the other hand, leisure yields are strengthening and demand remained strong, so going forward, our path to improving domestic RASM starts by moderating our domestic capacity growth. This will begin in our post-summer schedule that begins late August. With continued strength and leisure demand and yields reduced capacity growth should allow us to position our inventory towards higher yielding, long AP leisure fares. This should provide a cushion for unit revenues that will more than offset stubbornly low business fares that are largely sold within the month. July and August will post strong domestic margins and cash flow as we run out the remainder of our summer schedule. We are confident that we will then see substantial RASM improvement in the September timeframe and may even achieve positive domestic revenue as early as September. In Latin America, unit revenues were down 5% in the quarter. But June achieved our first positive unit revenue results in 26 months. This result was achieved as Brazil unit revenue declines moderated to just 4% on strengthening currency and capacity reductions. Delta has removed 25% of capacity in Brazil to deal with the economic crisis. Mexico continued to be strong for us on both leisure and business demand and RASM during the quarter was up 4 points. Caribbean demand remained solid and we expect favorable unit revenues beginning in 3Q as we lap our own and industry capacity increases. For the remainder of the year, our Latin capacity will decline 2 points to 3 points and we expect this entity to inflect in RASM, consistently as early as the September quarter on reduced currency pressures, strengthening demand and reduced capacity offering. Moving to the Pacific, the 5% unit revenue decline in the June quarter was the result of a 4-point headwind from lower year-on-year hedge gains. Additionally, there were 2 points of negative impact from \u2013 negative fuel searches \u2013 surcharges, partly offset by the appreciation of the end spot rate. As the business practice, we hedge at least 50% of our net yen exposure in any given quarter. However in 2015, we have more significant positions in place at more favorable rates than we do currently. In fact, we expect to recognize a $5 million hedge loss in the back half of this year compared to a $90 million gain last year. $70 million of that headwind will occur in the September quarter alone, accounting for nearly 1 point of negative system PRASM and more than 7 points of impact on the Pacific unit revenues. Excluding hedges, we achieved flat RASM in Japan in the June quarter held by our capacity adjustments, our focus on higher you yielding U.S. point of sales traffic and recovery in the Japan point of sale resort markets, driven by a stronger yen. The strength in Japan was firmly offset by yield pressures in China. Passenger growth in China was up 7% in the quarter and we continue to see increasing demand for connecting traffic with our partners China Eastern and China Southern. However, industry capacity to and from the U.S. increased nearly 25% in the second quarter, which pressured yields. This capacity is expected to continue in the second half. For the remainder of the year in the Pacific, we are accelerating our capacity reductions and expect to be down roughly 7.5% in the third quarter and 5% for the winter season. We expect the combination of our planned capacity reductions, along with the stronger yen to achieve positive RASM growth later this year, excluding the hedge impact. Finally, in the Trans-Atlantic entity, Delta\u2019s second quarter capacity grew in line with traffic trends at 2%, while the industry increased capacity by 10% pressuring yields. Although this drove our unit revenues down 4.5% for the quarter, the Trans-Atlantic is still on track to produce one of the most profitable summers in history. That said, this area continues to be where we face the greatest challenge in our efforts to get back to positive RASM and we are now facing even additional pressures from Brexit. In our Continental European markets, customer growth nearly matched capacity growth of five, but double digit low cost carrier growth pressured yields. In the second quarter, Delta and Air France KLM began a code-share agreement with Jet Airways. We are very optimistic about this opportunity to feed Paris, Amsterdam and London going forward. And given the contra-seasonal nature of the India market, we expect to have a positive impact on fourth quarter Trans-Atlantic revenues. In the UK, Delta\u2019s British pound denominated revenue is roughly 350 million on an annual basis. So when the pound devalued 12% versus the pre-Brexit levels, our revenues were reduced by 40 million from currency alone. Since the leave decision, we haven\u2019t seen a material impact on volumes, but as Ed mentioned along with our partner, Virgin Atlantic, we are taking additional capacity out of the UK for winter to address the headwinds of the region. The reduction is focused on UK origin leisure markets. These changes combined with other actions we are taking will result in our winter IATA scheduled capacity in the Trans-Atlantic being down for the second consecutive year. Even with these capacity actions, we do not expect RASM in the Trans-Atlantic to inflect until sometime in \u201817. At a system level, with these plans in place across all of our entities and the trends that we see today for the September quarter, we are forecasting system unit revenues to be down between 4% and 6% on a 1% to 2% year-over-year capacity increase. We expect July and August to be at or slightly below the bottom end of that range with September markedly better than both of those months. Calendar placement creates noise between the months and will be a 2-point headwind in August and a 2-point benefit to September. Additionally, September should see benefit and as currency and fuel surcharge headwinds ease and the fall capacity changes begin to be implemented. So to wrap everything up, while the current environment remains challenging, we continue to outperform our peer set. We have plans in place to address the challenges we face and are executing against those plans. Where we haven\u2019t seen the desire traction in our unit revenues, we are taking actions with revenue management strategies and capacity levels. And if necessary, we will take further actions to make sure that we maintain the momentum to achieve our goal of getting to positive unit revenue by year end and ahead of our network peers. And with that, I would like to turn it over to my good friend, Paul Jacobson. Paul Jacobson : Thanks Glen and thanks here to entire team. We all appreciate the efforts and the hard work that they are undergoing. Good morning everyone and appreciate you joining us this morning. Consistent cost execution again this quarter was a key contributor to Delta, delivering an operating margin that was within our initial guidance range before the 4-point headwind from the early fuels hedge settlements. While we continue to benefit from lower fuel costs, prices remain volatile as does the global environment and we must remain vigilant of those costs that we can control. At the same time, it is critical that we continue to invest in our product and enhance our performance and service to our customers. Total operating expenses declined by roughly $300 million in the quarter, driven by lower fuel expense. Non-fuel CASM was essentially flat despite pressure from higher wages and product and service investments. Our strong operational performance, our up-gauging initiatives and the commitment across the organization to delivering productivity savings, drove our solid cost performance again this quarter. I would like to thank the entire Delta team for driving another outstanding result this quarter. We have the best employees in the industry and this strong performance was made possible by their contributions. We expect our non-fuel unit costs including profit sharing to be roughly flat again in the September quarter and increase less than 2% for the full year. Turning to fuel, our total fuel expense declined by over $400 million as lower market fuel prices offset higher consumption and hedge losses. We made the decision in the quarter to early settle all of our remaining 2016 hedges, which brought in an additional $450 million of losses to the quarter. Our all-in fuel price was $1.97 per gallon, including $0.43 from those early settlements. The refinery lost a modest $10 million for the quarter and we expect a lower crack spread environment, which is a positive for Delta overall, will likely result in a modest loss for the refinery for the full year. Looking ahead, we expect an all-in September quarter fuel price of $1.52 to $1.57 per gallon, which is down 15% from the prior year. With the early hedge settlements complete, we don\u2019t expect to report any additional hedge losses in 2016. Now, let me address our margin outlook. With another quarter of solid cost performance despite persistent RASM headwinds and a moderating fuel environment, we are forecasting a September operating margin in the 19% to 21% range, which is roughly flat to last year. Moving on to cash flow, we generated $2.6 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter. We reinvested over $1 billion back into the business during the quarter, with spending primarily related to aircraft deliveries in modification projects. We expect capital spending will approximate $750 million in the third quarter as we now expect our Aeromexico tender offer to close in the fourth quarter. We will continue to take a balanced approach to the deployment of our cash as we remain focused on long-term durability and sustainability for the business model. This is what we are driving for with each dollar we spend whether it is going back into the business, the balance sheet or return to our owners. We ended the June quarter with net debt of $6.8 billion, down from $7.1 billion a year ago. That debt reduction saved another $34 million in interest expense this quarter. With the additional $135 million we contributed to the pension plan this quarter, we have completed our funding commitment for the year. The progress we have made on de-risking the balance sheet and paying down our debt was recognized by Fitch in the quarter with an upgrade to BBB-. We are now proud that two of the three rating agencies have provided us with this strong endorsement of our commitment to the long-term stability and viability of our business model. With the $1.6 billion of free cash flow we generated during the quarter, we continued on the path of also increasing shareholder returns with $103 million of dividends and just over $1 billion of share repurchases. As we announced at our May Analyst Meeting, our dividend will increase to $0.81 per share annually beginning in the September quarter. At current stock prices, this is just over a 2% dividend yield. In addition, we expect to complete our current $5 billion share repurchase authorization by next May, over 6 months ahead of schedule, which will represent our third consecutive authorization completed ahead of time. We expect to return nearly $3.5 billion to shareholders this year consistent with our goal of returning at least 70% of free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases. In closing, I want to express my excitement about the opportunities ahead for our business. We are going to continue to stretch ourselves. We are going to continue to follow through on our near-term and long-term plans. Our performance is simply remarkable against any measure and we are focused on remaining a leading S&P 500 company. Jill? Jill Sullivan Greer : And we are now ready for the analyst Q&A, if you could give them their instructions? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Michael Linenberg : Yes, hey. Just two quick ones. Can you just give us the breakout between domestic and international capacity growth for the third and fourth quarters? Glen Hauenstein : For the fourth quarter which is the endpoint \u2013 so I will start there. We will be up about 2 to 2.5 domestic and about down 2 to 2.5 internationally. Michael Linenberg : Okay. And then do you have that for the third quarter, Glen? Glen Hauenstein : For the third quarter, I do not have that. I am going to estimate it\u2019s about plus 3.5 for domestic and minus 1 for international. Michael Linenberg : Okay, that\u2019s perfect. And then just quick question on the Virgin Atlantic, the 49% stake, I know that runs to the non-op. In your June quarter, does that reflect their June quarter or is that a lag? I know sometimes with private companies, there is a quarter lag. I just want to clarify that. Glen Hauenstein : Yes, that\u2019s current, Mike. Michael Linenberg : So, it is the June quarter Virgin\u2019s numbers in your June quarter? Glen Hauenstein : Yes, they can count just like we can. Michael Linenberg : Okay, perfect. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Andrew Didora : To the questions, Paul, just on the \u2013 given the 2Q CASM results and the 3Q guide, is there anything from a timing or maintenance perspective in 4Q that would prevent you from coming in significantly below your sub 2% long-term CASM goal this year? Paul Jacobson : Good morning, Andrew. We are still \u2013 we haven\u2019t given any guidance on the fourth quarter. I would say that there isn\u2019t anything on the horizon in terms of maintenance that would cause us to deviate from that. I think we continue to run a great operation and manage through that. So, our goal is still to keep it below 2%. We are not going to give any forward guidance on 4Q. Andrew Didora : Okay. And then I guess secondly, Paul, obviously, there has been a lot of movement in the bond market since the Brexit vote and the 10-year treasuries in your record lows. Are there any significant pension implications that could end up creating a bit of the CASM headwind over the next year or so or is it too small? Paul Jacobson : Well, I think it\u2019s a little bit too soon to tell. Obviously, our balance sheet liability is impacted by rates. We have talked about that in the past. So, assuming rates don\u2019t revert back higher, we could see a higher balance sheet liability, but keep in mind that, that has little impact on expense and little impact \u2013 no impact at all on our minimum funding requirements for our strategy going forward, which is much longer term based. Andrew Didora : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : And we will take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Glen, I wonder if you could playback for us what you were expecting to see with respect to the June quarter monthly. How that was different than what you expected to see and how that maybe is impacting your forecast here into the third quarter, because I thought the idea was peak demand July, August would sort of soak up those excess seats and fix the close-in yield problem, but now it sounds like we are dependent much more on September and maybe a return to corporate. Glen Hauenstein : Yes. I think what we didn\u2019t expect in the beginning of the year was the continuation and acceleration of the declines in the business traffic sector. So, what we had anticipated is the strong demand leisure and that has borne out. The demand set for leisure is quite good and in line with our capacity offering, but it has not offset the close-in yield weakness that we have seen. And so that\u2019s how it played out and that leaves us with really no other choice, but to decrease the capacity levels moving forward, because we can\u2019t count on it to be as we have said in the earnings call, the stubbornly low close-in yields to go away. So, what we need to do now is not go into a month flat, because if we go into a month with flat RASM, we come out with a RASM that\u2019s in the minus 4, 5 range. So, we have to hit that up 3 to 4 to 5 as we come into the month knowing we are going to give away some of that yield within the month. So, that\u2019s kind of how it played out. And that\u2019s how we are looking toward September. Of course, when we planned the summer capacity that was back in the February/March time period and while we are looking in a rearview mirror, it will be an incredibly profitable record summer for us. So, it\u2019s not as disastrous as some people are characterizing it, but it\u2019s really robust and we are going to take the necessary actions to fix it moving forward. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thanks. And then just as a follow-up, could you give us maybe capacity growth by month? It looks like it\u2019s fairly similar right now in July, August, September. And then is there any implication for 2017 from that 1% year-to-year growth in the fourth quarter? Thanks for taking the questions. Ed Bastian : Duane, we didn\u2019t give the monthly capacity. So we are not going to lay it out. But I think you can roughly estimate where we are at today as the July, August and then once capacity starts to take down as we get out this summer season, late August into September, the number start to inflect with the greater reductions. We haven\u2019t given 2017 guidance out. But again if you look at our Q4, up 1%, I would expect our Q1 probably to be in that same range. And certainly by the time we get through this planning for the spring, if conditions are the same, we are going to continue to take the same fact on capacity. Duane Pfennigwerth : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Julie Yates from Credit Suisse. Julie Yates : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Glen, I just want to clarify on the PRASM cadence for the third quarter, you mentioned that July and August were looking weak and just to help calibrate expectations, should we expect to see July RASM worsen from June\u2019s down 5% and then improve steadily with September being the best month of the quarter? Glen Hauenstein : I think that\u2019s probably exactly how you would read it. Julie Yates : Okay, understood. And then just to reconcile, I mean domestic is now the worst performing entity and that\u2019s where capacity growth is still the highest, how do we get confidence on the level of sequential improvement we \u2013 that you need to see in order to write the PRASM trajectory to get to positive by year end? Glen Hauenstein : Right. Well, I think that is also where on an absolute basis, we are decreasing our rate of growth the most. And so we are going to be coming down about 300 basis points to 350 basis points from where we are in peak summer versus international, which is going down about 100 basis points. So I think if we have to go further, we will, but this is the next step and seeing if we can get the numbers to where we need them to be to continue to expand our margin into next year. Ed Bastian : And Julie, this is Ed. Just domestic is incredibly strong in aggregate. I realize the RASM numbers have been weak, but the bottom line results have been phenomenal. And the premium that we continue to generate versus the competition for domestic is about 1.20. So the team is doing a great job domestically. But we realize in order to get the RASM improvement to match the increasing fuel prices, we are going to be paying we need to be making the adjustments that Glen talked about. Julie Yates : Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : And we will take our next question from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company. Helane Becker : Hi, I just took some water, [indiscernible] I am okay. I just was wondering, could you update us on where you are with respect to aircraft retirements in the Pacific and how that affects capacity growth in that market for the back half of the year? Ed Bastian : We still have six 747-400s that are flying in the Pacific that are off schedule to be retired by the year end of \u201817. We are trying to accelerate that closer to September. But that would likely in and of itself would have a negative bias on Pacific capacity and through the year and next year. It will also be a significant improvement to our P&L as we replace the aging airplanes with much more efficient equipment. Helane Becker : Okay. And is that included in that system capacity guidance of down 1% that you are referring to in the comments today? Ed Bastian : Well, I may have missed \u2013 you may have misinterpreted what I said. The last six don\u2019t come out until the fourth quarter of next year, not this year. Helane Becker : Okay, got it, fourth quarter \u201817. And then on an unrelated topic, I am just wondering the tax rate was down, I think it was maybe guidance was 34% or somehow I thought it was going to be 34% and the actual was 33%, so is that \u2013 is there something special in there? Paul Jacobson : Good morning, Helane. It\u2019s Paul. I hope you got your breath back there. We \u2013 during the quarter, we early adopted the set new FASB policy on stock compensation with a benefit to our tax rate for the quarter. But we still expect our full year tax rate to be 34%. Helane Becker : Got it, okay. Thank you very much for your help. Ed Bastian : Thank you, Helane. Operator : And we will take our next question from Hunter Keay the Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : Thank you very much. Good morning. Ed Bastian : Good morning Hunter. Hunter Keay : So Ed, I think the last year has proven out that investors probably care more about fundamental behavior from airlines rather than traditional business metrics like profit, for example, so as you think about \u2013 you have the long-term financial goals that you guys have laid out relating to ROIC, cash flow, debt and earnings growth, I am kind of curious why you still think earnings growth is a fact, you actually highlighted that and specifically in your prepared remarks, do your \u2013 the question is, do your investors tell you that that is something they still want, because it\u2019s certainly not something that other transport or industrial companies achieve or even strive for that\u2019s rated multiples that are much higher than airlines right now, so I guess the question is why is that one metric still included in the bunch? Ed Bastian : I am not sure I follow entirely your question. Why are we focused on growing our earnings, is that your question? Hunter Keay : Yes. I guess, well, let me put it in this way, 15% is a lot and inherent in that implies some degree of probable capacity growth to get there, so you think you talk about ROIC and debt and cash flow and people I think all appreciate that, but just like you guys will probably always be a value stock, so why focus on earnings growth, is that something you hear from your investors, is that something that\u2019s important? Ed Bastian : Yes. We hear from our long-term investors that are continuing to improve all of our financial metrics whether it\u2019s our ROIC or our earnings potential, our top line growth are all important. We realize we sit in a volatile industry in a volatile space. But we are \u2013 our goal is to prove the sustainability and durability of the model. And we think earnings growth is important, yes. Hunter Keay : Okay, alright. That\u2019s fine. And then Glen, you talked about corporate a little bit, we figured airlines talk about this issue of dilution as it relates to some of the closing price pressure I mean it\u2019s obviously, you said volumes are pretty good, so would you categorize dilution as sort of the biggest source of controllable factors contributing to some of the domestic PRASM weakness and if it\u2019s not that, what would you say it is? Glen Hauenstein : I think we have talked about this before. It\u2019s more of the same. It\u2019s the way you are approaching the time value for time sensitive customers. And are you getting what people will be willing to pay for their time versus what the market was charging for the time. And if you look business barriers, as these quarters rollout with government, we can all look at it. But what I think you will see is that the business fares are well below where they have been historically. And in a lot of markets where there have been little capacity, even no capacity, even negative capacity changes over the medium term. So I hear your question. And I wish I had the best answer for why that is there. But I think like everything, it\u2019s a part of the cycle. I think it has to do with lower fuel. And I think as our fuel rolls through, everybody\u2019s P&Ls that there will be a lot more focus on that. But that\u2019s not \u2013 we are a small percentage in the industry. We represent less than 20% of the total industry. So we don\u2019t have that kind of power or predictions to be able to go out and say those things. Hunter Keay : Okay, thank you. Ed Bastian : Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Jamie Baker : Hi, good morning everybody. Ed Bastian : Hi, Jamie. Jamie Baker : Glen, other revenue declined slightly from the first quarter, which seems a bit inconsistent with seasonality, I know there\u2019s stuff in that category other than ancillary revenue, I am just wondering what the moving pieces were that drove the decline especially since as you noted, Comfort+ turned on in the month of May? Paul Jacobson : Hi, good morning, Jamie. It\u2019s Paul. One of the big items in that was lower year-over-year third-party sales from the refinery, so there is a piece of that, that has to flow through gross up revenues and net it out of expense. So with the lower crude oil prices, the product values are substantially down. So that was about $65 million of that number. Jamie Baker : Okay, that makes perfectly good sense. Second, if we exclude the hedge impact in the second quarter, you essentially achieved 21% operating margin and you are guiding 19% to 21% for the fourth quarter, I would have to go back, I think it\u2019s 8 years now to find a time when third quarter margins were softer, potentially softer than in the second quarter. And look, I am not asking you to rehash the components of the guide, the currency disclosures were certainly helpful, but it seems puzzling to me that against an industry backdrop that is so much better today than in 2008, you aren\u2019t even able to achieve normal seasonality, is this just a blip or potentially a new normal in how we think about sort of the seasonal marginal \u2013 margin peaks? Glen Hauenstein : Jamie, you asked a lot in that question and I have not gone back to check to 2008. 2008 to me is a blur going back in time. Listen, our guide is our best estimate to where we sit now. We do not think that we are at a \u2013 trying to forecast any type of inflection on the cycle or the margins if that\u2019s your question. It\u2019s really where we are. Fuel prices have bounced around a fair bit and fuel prices are up a bit in Q3 versus Q2, hedge aside. And we realized that we do have unit revenue weakness, particularly in the first half of Q3 that we are recognizing. So, I think that if you look at Q3 year-on-year, I think we are about flat, 20% pre-tax margin and I think that\u2019s a \u2013 that\u2019s about all I can draw from that. Jamie Baker : So nothing structural to suggest that in the long run you would not continue to be a third quarter airline so to speak, third quarter representing the absolute peak of the year? Ed Bastian : Yes, I think the third quarter is the peak of the year. Candidly, it\u2019s this June, July and August, right? So, that continues to be our \u2013 that\u2019s our sweet spot. Jamie Baker : Yes, okay. I appreciate the disclosures. Thanks, everybody. Ed Bastian : Sure. Operator : We will take our next question from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Jack Atkins : Hey, good morning. Thanks for the time. When we speak specifically about the capacity actions that you are taking both those announced in May and those announced this morning, can you quantify specifically how those actions will impact PRASM? Can you sort of bracket that in terms of impacts? Ed Bastian : It will improve RASM. How is that? Jack Atkins : Okay. So, I guess when you think about your desire to get to positive RASM by year end, will you be willing to go to negative capacity growth year-over-year to get to that level? Ed Bastian : No, that\u2019s not our plan. Jack Atkins : Okay, thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Darryl Genovesi : Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. Ed, Glen, you both mentioned that you think fuel is the biggest driver of higher RASM on a perspective basis. And I guess I was just wondering how you come to that conclusion? Do you mean to imply that this move from the kind of $27 or so rent that we saw for a short period in January up to 46, 47 today is likely to have driven a negative profit contribution from some flying in the network, Delta or your peers and that\u2019s likely to drive a capacity reduction? I mean, is that kind of the thought process? Glen Hauenstein : Well, if you look historically the trends that follow and we started with fuel around 100. We get all the way down to about 25 to 27. And then now we have been moving back up into the mid to high 40s. It\u2019s very, very high R-squared to go back and look at airline revenues with fuel over time and the lag time that produces the highest R-squared is about 9 months. So, that\u2019s over a very, very long period of time within the industry. And I think that\u2019s what we are counting on as that on the margin when fuel was $25 there were players who were pricing their products at the incremental marginal cost of $25 fuel. That marginal cost of production has gone up substantially since the low point. And normally, it would take about 9 months for that to flow through to airline revenues. Darryl Genovesi : Okay and thanks for that. And then I guess just maybe to follow-up just on Hunter\u2019s question a little bit. With regards to the close-in yield weakness that we have seen, I guess I would have thought that by this point, assuming that problem isn\u2019t actually getting worse and maybe it is. But I guess I would have thought that at this point, the RM systems would be sort of calibrated and thus holding on \u2013 sorry that\u2019s not holding on to as much inventory for sort of late in the booking curve bookings. Is that not the case? Glen Hauenstein : Well, late in the booking curve bookings even though their depressed are significantly higher than early in the booking curve bookings. So, you never want to turn out late in the booking curve booking away even though they are depressed on a relative basis. Darryl Genovesi : Okay. I mean I guess, I just it seems like \u2013 at least it seems like in some cases, some of these fares that are being offered very closed in are actually lower than what you can buy in it \u2013 for an advance, I mean obviously I have seen some of that myself and heard about it anecdotally and just wonder if there was any progress being made towards cleaning some of that up? Glen Hauenstein : Yes, we can\u2019t comment on forward pricing. But generally close-in yields are significantly higher than long AP yields. And so that hasn\u2019t changed. Darryl Genovesi : Okay, thank you. Glen Hauenstein : Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Joseph DeNardi : Hey, thank you. Glen, the flat PRASM or positive PRASM, is that being for fourth or the month of December? And then secondly, it sounds like the capacity actions you are taking today are entirely or exclusively focused on the UK and Brexit. If you are seeing weaker close-in yields domestically and softer corporate traffic domestically, why isn\u2019t domestic capacity coming down? Ed Bastian : No, I think you misread that. Domestic capacity is coming down significantly. We are decreasing our domestic offering in the fourth quarter versus the current quarter by about 300 basis points, so a very significant decrease in domestic capacity coming from us. Joseph DeNardi : Okay. And then the RASM goal is that flat for the month of December or positive for December or is it for the full quarter? Paul Jacobson : Yes, that\u2019s our goal, Joe. Our goal has been to try to get there by the end of the year. And when we get there, we will let you know. Joseph DeNardi : Okay. Does that year mean December or the fourth quarter? Paul Jacobson : We will take either. Joseph DeNardi : Okay. And then Paul, next year, a year when we should expect maybe a bigger step up in the FX agreement. Is there some sort of contractual amendment that\u2019s coming next year, any color there? Paul Jacobson : Good morning, Joe. There is no amendment. As we announced in the Investor Day, we talked about it a couple year period from the overlap with the prior year agreement and then the new agreement beginning in 2017. So, we have talked about having some additional benefits occurring in 2017 going forward. We will have more of that probably at Investor Day. Joseph DeNardi : Okay, thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi Syth : Hey, good morning. Paul, if I may ask. Your \u2013 the core cost performance, I think if you adjust for kind of the labor increased pressures. It\u2019s been quite impressive and I am guessing FX is going to benefit about maybe 0.5 point. But could you talk a little bit more about what\u2019s driving the kind of \u2013 and I am curious, I mean this is the kind of basis that kind of the declines that we are seeing in contract carrier maintenance, I think landing pack services. I am just trying to get an understanding of \u2013 does that continue in the second half in 2017 or how should we think about these offsets that you have been driving? Paul Jacobson : Sure. Good morning, Savy and thanks for those comments. The biggest driver of our cost performance has obviously been the continued upgauging and efficiency being created in the business through that. As we have talked about in the past, our upgauging has been accruing at about a rate of about 5% a year from 2012 through 2015. And we have, with our current fleet plans about a 7% upgrade \u2013 upgauge between 2016 and 2020. So clearly, that has had a material benefit on our ability to drive cost efficiencies in the business. That combined with the innovation of Gill\u2019s team and others across the operational sphere have been a huge, huge benefit for us going forward. And we\u2019 have got to continue to find ways to drive productivity in the business without impacting and in fact, enhancing the customer and employee experience, which I think the team has done a great job of. Savi Syth : Alright, thanks for that. And then a follow-up question. And Glen, I hate to beat a dead horse on this, but I was just I am trying to understand on the close-in yields. If it deteriorated as you went through the quarter and the reason I ask that is, with the comment on leisure yields transcend. I thought it was kind of those lower fares that are putting pressure then on close-in yields and it\u2019s kind of the lowest fares and leisure fares strength and I am kind of surprised that we are not seeing at least no further deterioration in those close-in yields and so I am wondering is this maybe sort of actual weakness in corporate that we are seeing? Glen Hauenstein : So, I think there are a couple of things that we just did a poll survey and maybe I will let Steve talk to that. Steve, you want to pipe in on. Steve Sear : Yes. Our June corporate survey actually had an uptick year-over-year, but basically stable outlook on all of our top corporate accounts. So we see it really relatively flat demand throughout the entire year so far. So again, we see a little bit on that yield pressure. Glen Hauenstein : And so that would say that the real component is that we have flattish corporate demand. We have corporate yields down on the five to seven category. And we have capacity that\u2019s growing in excess at the rate of growth of the corporate demand set, which is also putting downward pressure on the total RASM. And those are kind of the three components we see. Savi Syth : That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks. And just one clarification on the earnings growth over time, you are talking about EPS growth right and not necessarily just earnings? Glen Hauenstein : We are telling EPS growth, that\u2019s right Savi. Savi Syth : Alright. Thank you. Glen Hauenstein : Thank you. Jill Sullivan Greer : And we are going to have time for one more question from the analysts. Operator : And we will take our final question from Dan McKinsey from Buckingham Research. Dan McKinsey : Okay. Good morning guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Glen, how is Delta getting to less capacity exactly from the reduced Atlantic flying, is it less capacity with the same number of planes, is it flying being redeployed to other markets as an optimization move or are some planes potentially being early retired here? Glen Hauenstein : It\u2019s a little bit of all of the above. If you look at our fleet counts for summer of this year versus summer of last year, it is almost flat. I think based on about 1,500 flying airplanes, we were up about eight. So the increased capacity has been coming on the marginal utilization because of lower fuel and what we are seeing is we are not getting paid for that, so that\u2019s coming out. And we will be doing a lot of \u2013 more cancellations in the off-peak, more cancellations in the ad-hoc world, as well as gauge reductions. And may be we haven\u2019t committed to it yet but some markets will not make it through. Dan McKinsey : Understood. Okay. And then Glen, in May, you talked about seeing some green shoots in the Latin America region and since then we have had a huge move in FX particularly to Brazil and just given what\u2019s happening with capacity and foreign exchange to the country and to the region, I am wondering if you can collaborate a little bit more in the revenue roadmap from here in this entity. And then tied to that, is there a revenue benefit potentially from Aeromexico that could be incremental in the back half of the year? Glen Hauenstein : Well, I think we have mentioned in the prepared remarks that the Latin unit revenues were up in the month of June for the first time in 26 months. So those green shoots that we saw last quarter are actually coming in and again being driven by strength in Mexico and a lot of that strength may be related to the presence of Delta and Aeromexico together because it seems that we are getting a much higher share of some of the corporate travel to and from Mexico. And we have had historically even before our ATI enabled joint venture goes into place. And Peter Carter is sitting next to me, may be Peter can talk about the timing of when we believe Aeromexico will be approved. Peter Carter : Yes. Good morning, Dan. We expect it to be approved in the fourth quarter. Dan McKinsey : Understood. Thanks. And then just one final housecleaning Paul, has Delta been active in buying back stocks since June 30? Paul Jacobson : Dan, good morning, we \u2013 as we talked about before, we are in the market every day, buying back stock. And this quarter is no different. Dan McKinsey : Thanks for the time guys. Glen Hauenstein : Thanks, Dan. Jill Sullivan Greer : Let\u2019s now wrap up the analyst portion of the call. And I will now turn it over to Kevin. Kevin Shinkle : Good morning. This is Kevin Shinkle. Welcome to the media portion of the call. We will have about 10 minutes for questions. So please limit yourself to one question and one brief follow-up. Kyle, will you please provide the instructions on how to register and ask the question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Jeffrey Dastin with Reuters. Jeffrey Dastin : Thank you for taking the question. Might you breakdown why Trans-Atlantic flights will have one of their most profitable summers in history, is it countries and with which countries and which point of origin, leisure was corporate bookings, that sort of thing? Ed Bastian : We don\u2019t provide that level of detail, Jeffrey. Trans-Atlantic for us historically has been a strong source of profit. And as we have expanded to the UK with our Virgin relationship, we have just built on that. Jeffrey Dastin : Great. Thank you. And then the follow-up will be, how do forward bookings to the United Kingdom for the fourth quarter compare to how they were last year as in were bookings are faster in the capacity tweaks not just the currency? Ed Bastian : The currency certainly has impacted the booking point of sale. And we have seen some strength in the U.S. point of sale to the UK as the talent has deteriorated. Likewise, we have seen some reduction in our UK point of sale coming to the U.S. And that\u2019s why we are making certain of the capacity adjustments combined with overall high levels of capacity in the North Atlantic, which is putting pressure on yields even before Brexit. Jeffrey Dastin : Great. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Michael Sasso with Bloomberg News. Michael Sasso : Hey, good morning. I am just a little confused about the issue with close-in bookings, it sounds like demand is still okay, but that maybe some of the problem is too much capacity, is that what I am hearing, can you just explain what specifically is causing those close-in yields to be lower? Ed Bastian : Well, industry pricing is lower year-over-year and that\u2019s probably the main driver of it. But when you have capacity growth and you have stable demand, that\u2019s also a negative impact to the total composition of your unit revenues, because corporate travel is of course the highest yielding piece of our yield curve. So it\u2019s a combination of too much capacity and too low fares. Glen Hauenstein : Next question. Operator : And we will take our next question from David Koenig with The Associated Press. David Koenig : Hi, I thought you might touch on this in the last answer in the analyst session, but should we expect you to drop any routes or markets entirely as part of your reduced planned capacity \u2013 hello? Ed Bastian : Hello, we don\u2019t comment on future scheduled changes or future pricing initiatives as a general... David Koenig : Okay. Yes. I am not asking you to name the routes or markets, I am just wondering if that\u2019s something we should expect as a possibility? Ed Bastian : We evaluate them all the time and we add routes and delete routes from our network on a regular basis. So the answer is that we will adjust to market conditions as we see them evolve. David Koenig : Okay, thanks. Operator : We will take our next question from Kelly Yamanouchi with Atlanta Journal Constitution. Kelly Yamanouchi : Hi there. I am wondering about the UK origin leisure markets that you mentioned the capacity cuts will be targeted at, I was just wondering what kinds of markets are UK origin leisure markets? Glen Hauenstein : Well, clearly London has \u2013 is the biggest market in the UK. But London has a very, very high business component. As a matter of fact, London represents about 35% of the total business to and from the U.S. between U.S. and Europe. So what we are doing is we are taking potentially down frequencies in off peak days. We are down-gauging equipment into the regional cities. Manchester tends to be a perfect example of much higher UK point of origin market and that one because there is a lot of leisure travel coming out of Manchester. And those would be the types of markets that we would look at to reduce. Ed Bastian : Kelly, this is Ed. We have grown substantially in the UK in the last several years, both we and our partner Virgin Atlantic. So I wouldn\u2019t be focused on it. This is more trimming from the overall growth. You have to look at this over a longer time horizon. And our capacity is up substantially to the UK over any period of time. So I think this is a normal part of the ebb and flow of supply and demand. Kelly Yamanouchi : Alright, great. Thank you very much. Operator : We will take our next question from Ted Reed from The Street. Ted Reed : A Brexit question, my impression from what you said was that more Americans are going to UK in the summer. And so there is good \u2013 very good summer travel, but in the winter, the UK travel to the U.S., the U.S. leisure destinations is what\u2019s declining. Is that fair? Ed Bastian : That\u2019s our best estimate, Ted, yes. Ted Reed : When you say leisure destination, does that mean Florida for the UK people coming in the winter, is that Florida? Ed Bastian : Florida, Vegas, just broadly New York. Ted Reed : Okay, alright. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Edward Russell with Flight Global. Edward Russell : Hi, yes. On the UK cuts, I was wondering are those going to be seasonal just during the winter and the off-peak periods or are they intended to be permanent cuts? Ed Bastian : They are just seasonal. Edward Russell : Okay. And then second question, what does this mean for the new routes that you have announced for 2017 into the UK, Portland, additional frequencies from Detroit and Atlanta? Paul Jacobson : There is no changes. Edward Russell : Thank you very much. Operator : And we will take our next question from Linda Loyd with the Philadelphia Inquirer. Linda Loyd : Thank you. Thank you for taking my question. With the Trainer refinery posting a loss for the second quarter, $10 million loss in the latest quarter and a $28 million loss in the first quarter, is the refinery still a benefit to Delta, are you still glad you bought it? Paul Jacobson : Good morning, Linda. This is Paul Jacobson. Yes, the answer is absolutely. The Trainer refinery for us has been a huge success. And as we talked about the lower crack spread environment that exists for the entire refining complex is a tremendous benefit to the airline. So, as part of the integrated fuel management strategy, we are absolutely still very pleased with that purchase and that investment. Linda Loyd : Is there a time you envisioned the refinery becoming profitable again as you look out in future quarters or this year? Paul Jacobson : Well, I mean, certainly we have had profitable years with the refinery and that business is very cyclical. We certainly hope it doesn\u2019t come at the expense of significantly higher fuel for the airline. But you have got to remember that its part of that integrated strategy and we know we will have good times and bad times with that refinery, but we are absolutely committed to it despite \u2013 or irrespective of its profits. Ed Bastian : Yes, Linda, this is Ed. Let me be very clear. We are very happy with the refinery. They are doing a great job. And yes, we expect they will continue to generate profits as they have historically for Delta over time. Linda Loyd : Okay, thank you very much. Kevin Shinkle : Kyle, we have time for one last question. Operator : And we will take our final question from Elliott Blackburn with Argus Media. Elliott Blackburn : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just building off that last question. Can you kind of go through, I mean, considering the fact that the refinery will be adding to your fuel costs it sounds like for the rest of the year. What does success look like more broadly for that refinery? How do you guys valuate that refinery as a contributor? Paul Jacobson : Well, Elliott, the main purpose of buying that refinery as articulated in our \u2013 all of our commentary has been to still supply jet fuel and increase the supply of jet fuel, which we have done very successfully. We measured the success of that refinery based on how well it operates and the team that we have there has been performing extraordinarily well. From a cost basis, from an operational reliability cost basis, the refinery leads all comparable indices both in size and geography for its efficiency and its productivity. The absolute crack spreads and the economics of that, you have got to take into account the airline. And when crack spreads are down that puts pressure on refinery profits, but it\u2019s a huge windfall for the airline as well. So, we feel very good about that. And as long as it continues to operate the way it is, we view it as strongly successful. Elliott Blackburn : But it seems like your peers that are also buying jet fuel benefit from that without actually having the risk of operating a refinery. So, I guess can you help me understand why the refinery itself is a unique benefit to Delta in light of that? Paul Jacobson : Well, the fact that it may or may not be a benefit to our customers doesn\u2019t have any \u2013 or our competitors, doesn\u2019t have any bearing as to whether or not we view it as a success for Delta and we do things that are good for us and the refinery is a great example of that. Ed Bastian : Don\u2019t forget, this was a refinery that was closed. And when we reopened it, we added 40% more supply, the jet fuel into the New York harbor. That alone was a substantial benefit for Delta. And to the extent it benefits our colleagues and industry all the better. Elliott Blackburn : Thank you very much. Operator : And that does conclude our Q&A session. I would now like to turn it back over to management for any additional or closing remarks. Ed Bastian : With that said, that concludes everything. Thank you for joining us. Operator : And this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Noah and I will be your coordinator. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Jill Sullivan-Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Jill Sullivan-Greer: Thanks, Noah. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us for our September quarter call. Joining us from Atlanta today are our CEO Ed Bastian, our President Glen Hauenstein and our CFO Paul Jacobson. Our entire leadership team is here in the room for the Q&A session. Ed will open the call and give an overview of our financial performance. Glen will then address the revenue environment and Paul will conclude with a review of our cost performance and cash flow. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up.  Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the investor relations page at IR.Delta.com.  With that, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Ed Bastian. Ed Bastian : Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everyone, appreciate you joining us. This morning Delta reported a $1.9 billion pretax profit for the September quarter and earnings per share of $1.70 versus consensus of $1.65. The resiliency of our business and our people stood out this quarter as we generated a solid 19% operating margin, $1.1 billion of free cash flow despite the weakest revenue environment in recent memory and the impact of the $150 million technology outage.  We apologize once more to those who were impacted by the outage and have already taken action to make sure an event like this doesn't happen again. I want to thank the entire Delta team for their great efforts, not only through the disruption, but also as we've worked to restore customers' confidence in Delta's reliability. Even with the impact of the outage, we delivered solid operations with a 99% mainline completion factor and an on-time arrival rate of 84% for the quarter.  Importantly, of the 22 systemwide perfect completion factor days we had this quarter, what we call \"brand perfect days\" with both Delta and Delta Connection having perfect completion in all 5500 daily flights, 21 of them came after the events in August. So the operation is back and running stronger than ever and our team proved once more why they are the very best. I'm pleased to say we've added another $325 million towards next year's profit sharing for our employees, bringing the total so far this year to $920 million. While the outage was a one-time event, the bigger challenge we face is from continued unit revenue declines, a trend that has persisted for the last seven quarters. And while our strong cost execution and lower fuel prices allowed us to keep margins consistent with last year in the September quarter, market fuel prices look to be higher in the upcoming quarter for the first time in several years. Therefore it continues to be a top priority for us to return to positive RASM in order to stabilize our margin performance and demonstrate the durability of the business model we have built.  Capacity is a significant lever we can use to impact that performance and based on our RASM results earlier this year, we made the decision to lower our capacity growth to below 2% for the September quarter. And while the pace of improvement has been slower than we hoped, our unit revenues have started to move in the right direction with these lower capacity levels to which Glen will provide greater detail.  That said, RASM remains negative and will stay conservative with our capacity, capping growth at 1% for the fourth quarter, a level of growth that we plan to carry over throughout 2017. With this cautious approach, we can focus on firming the trends that have us on track for positive unit revenues likely sometime early next year. This will go a long way towards demonstrating that Delta can sustain solid profits, margins and cash flows throughout the business cycle and provide further evidence that we have built a durable and sustainable model that warrants an improved valuation. I want to thank the management and ALPA negotiating teams who've worked tirelessly to get to the agreement in principle that we reached with our pilots two weeks ago. The potential agreement recognizes the important leadership role our pilots play in Delta's long term success. It is now going through ALPA's approval and ratification process and to respect that process we're not going to comment any further than what I've just said. Finally in closing, I want to thank Richard for his leadership, his courage and his friendship to us all Delta, as he is now fully retired. Richard has been a transformative leader at Delta as well as for the industry. He is a true servant-leader as he served all 80,000 of us from his heart. We're fortunate to have Frank Blake, another outstanding leader, as our new Chairman. We look forward to working closely with Frank as we build an even stronger and more durable franchise for the future. With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Glen. Glen Hauenstein : Thanks, Ed and good morning, everyone. I'd also like to start by thanking the Delta people for their perseverance through a challenging quarter. It is your hard work and dedication that sets Delta apart in our customers' eyes. And that translates into the revenue premium we realize to the industry. As Ed mentioned, the biggest challenge we face as a company is the persistent decline of unit revenues. This quarter our RASM was down 6.8%, including roughly 1 point of impact on the August outage and an additional point of headwind as we lapped the yen hedge gains from last year. Excluding our outage, our unit revenues were at the bottom end of our initial guidance range and we attribute that shortfall primarily to two factors. First, the Transatlantic proved more challenging than we expected, given the supply/demand imbalance in the region, caused by multiple terrorist events, low-cost carrier growth and Brexit which we're primarily seeing in the devaluation of the British pound. Second, the domestic close-in yield environment was weaker than expected in the first half of the quarter, particularly in early August. Overall, domestic unit revenues declined 7% on 4% capacity growth in the September quarter, with nearly 2 points of the decline attributable to the August outage. While this result was weaker than we initially anticipated, we did see improvement as we went through the quarter, particularly as we lowered our capacity levels with our fall schedule in mid-August and adjusted some revenue management strategies.  The improvement was most evident in September when domestic unit revenue declines moderated to 2.5% for the month, driven primarily by improving business revenues. It is these trends that give us cautious optimism that we will have a path to positive RASM in the domestic entity in the December-January time frame, if not shortly thereafter. To get there, we will slow our domestic capacity growth further in the fourth quarter to 2.5% year-over-year which is less than half the rate we grew during the first three quarters of the year. We believe this lower capacity profile will position us to achieve a better RASM result during the upcoming off-peak season.  As I mentioned, we adjusted our revenue management strategies. As we have rolled out this new approach, we have seen close-in yields strengthen and we're working to build on this trend going forward. In September, over one third of our domestic network saw RASM improve year-over-year, up from a low of 15% that occurred during the first quarter. We expect that percentage to exceed 50% over the next 90 days. There are some calendar delays over the next few months, but we believe on a combined basis, domestic RASM for November through January should be flattish as travel patterns shift between months due to holiday placements. And with domestic, the biggest driver of our overall system performance, this will be the major push we need to get our overall unit revenues back into positive territory.  Moving on to Latin, I am pleased to say this is the first region to have turned the corner with a unit revenue improvement of 1.5% this quarter, the first time a Latin entity has achieved a positive unit revenue in 2 1/2 years. After 16 consecutive quarters of negative results, Brazil unit revenues improved 30% year-on-year, with momentum building through the quarter as strengthening real drove more Brazil point-of-sale demand. We're seeing this positive trend continue as we head into the peak demand season. Mexico business markets have also been a key driver on Latin's path to positive RASM, achieving the third consecutive quarter of positive unit revenues. U.S. and Mexico open skies were ratified and took effect late August and we expect the U.S. DOT will grant antitrust immunity by year-end, paving the way for the implementation of our joint venture with Aeromexico. Delta's U.S.-Mexico scale will triple as a result of the partnership and it will allow us to build on the strong momentum we already have in the largest revenue market for U.S. travel to Latin America. Regarding our fourth quarter 2016 outlook, capacity in Latin America will remain flat as we continue to look to improve our RASM performance before growing further in the region.  Turning to the Pacific, in the September quarter the region saw positive RASM ex hedge for the first time since 2013. Japan was a notable bright spot with RASM ex hedge of 4% year-over-year driven by a stronger yen. On the other hand, China continues to be challenged as industry capacity growth outpaced increases in demand. Looking ahead, the industry supply-demand imbalance in the Pacific will become more acute in the winter off-peak season, with industry capacity up 11% in the fourth quarter, while demand is only up mid to high single digits. We will also continue to face the headwinds as we lap last year's hedge gains. For the fourth quarter, it is a $30 million impact or about half a point on system PRASM which translates to nearly a five point drag on Pacific unit revenues. While we were able to secure two daylight frequencies with the limiting opening of Haneda, it's forcing us to split our Tokyo operations between two airports, Haneda and Narita. As a result, we announced in August that we will be further restructuring the Narita hub with the winter schedule. The network changes will result in a 30% capacity reduction to and from Japan this winter and allow us to retire two additional 747s by the end of the year. With the Pacific broadly, we will reduce our winter capacity by 9% to 10% as we continue to restructure our network for long term profitability and sustainability in the region.  And finally we get to the Transatlantic. September quarter unit revenues were down 9.7%, driven by overcapacity, particularly from LCCs and Middle East carriers, while terrorism concerns, sluggish economies and Brexit all weighed on the demand side. While the revenue environment was probably the most challenging, we also had a solidly profitable summer because of lower fuel. That said, as we go into the seasonally weaker period, we will reduce our capacity offering by three to four points starting in November to address the unit revenue challenges we're facing. While we're expecting it to take a bit longer to get to unit revenue growth in the Transatlantic, we do expect that the pace of declines will moderate going forward.  As we look out further, the Transatlantic has had some of the most unique competitive dynamics and we need to adopt our model to continue to leverage our existing joint ventures and seek new partners as we have done recently with Jet Airways, in addition to carefully managing our capacity in the region.  Now let me address our fourth quarter outlook. We expect system unit revenues to be down in the 3% to 5% range, on a 1% capacity increase. In closing, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about the unit revenue trends we're starting to see in significant portions of our network and we expect that with a lot of hard work we can continue to drive improvement and get to positive unit revenues by early next year. But as we have commented before, if we do not see the performance we expect as we move through the quarter, we will move quickly to make the changes we need to get the right outcome.  With that, I'll turn it over to Paul. Paul Jacobson : Thank you, Glen and good morning, everyone, thank you for joining us this morning. Once again this quarter the Delta team was able to show with our continued discipline on cost and focus on free cash flow that we've built a solid foundation that has put us in a good position to weather the inevitable challenges we face in this business to deliver sustainable results. Lower fuel prices drove a roughly $300 million decline in total operating expenses, on a 1.5% increase in capacity. Non-fuel CASM was essentially flat, including the half-point impact of the outage. This result is consistent with our initial guidance, as we continue to leverage the solid cost foundation we have built and deliver strong productivity savings, while we also continue to benefit from our upgauging initiatives. We expect our non-fuel unit cost to increase 1% to 2% in the December quarter which doesn't include any impact for a potential pilot agreement. This is slightly higher than our run rate from the past couple of quarters, but still comfortably below our 2% annual target, as we're seeing some pressure from our lower capacity levels and timing of maintenance spend. Turning to fuel, our total fuel expense declined by $350 million or 18% year-over-year, we had no hedge impacts during the current period given our decision to early settle our remaining 2016 positions during the June quarter. The refinery lost $45 million for the quarter, consistent with expectations driven by lower crack spreads. The hard work of our fuel team, coupled with the expertise we have with the refinery, has allowed us to harvest about a $0.03 per gallon unhedged fuel cost advantage over our competitors and we're focused on widening that lead. This advantage will become even more important as we look ahead to the fourth quarter and beyond, with market fuel prices already higher year-over-year for the first time in over two years. We expect an all-in December quarter fuel price of $1.60 to $1.65 per gallon which is down for us year-over-year as we paid above market rates during the same period in 2015, but higher on a market basis. Now let me address our margin outlook. While we expect another quarter of solid cost performance, given a waning fuel tailwind and continued RASM headwinds, we're forecasting a December quarter operating margin in the 14% to 16% range which is down roughly 2 points year-over-year. As Ed and Glen both mentioned, we're cautiously optimistic about the revenue environment and combined with our conservative capacity plans, reinforces our focus on maintaining our margin performance. Moving to cash flow, we generated $1.8 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter. We continued our balanced approach of deploying that cash with more than $650 million going back into the business, as we took delivery of 11 mainline aircraft and our fleet modification projects continue. We expect core capital spending will be roughly $700 million in the fourth quarter and we expect to spend an additional $520 million on the Aeromexico tender offer. We ended the September quarter with net debt of $6.4 billion, down roughly $400 million sequentially from June.  We generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow and returned $650 million to our shareholders during the quarter. That brings the total amount of cash we have returned to our owners year-to-date to $2.7 billion which already exceeds the level returned during all of 2015. We remain on track to meet our goal of returning at least 70% of our free cash flow this year to our owners. In closing, I also want to express my gratitude to the Delta family for all of your hard work and perseverance during the quarter that allowed us to deliver cost performance that was consistent with our initial outlook, despite the headwinds we experienced. I am confident that our efforts will allow us to continue to deliver sustainable results regardless of the challenges we face. Jill? Jill Sullivan-Greer: Thanks, Ed, Glen and Paul. Before we turn to the analyst Q&A, I'd like to remind everybody to mark your calendars for Delta's annual Investor Day which this year will be held on December 15. So with that Noah, if you could give everybody instructions for the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : Can you guys talk about, you mentioned LCCs in the Transatlantic and you talked about leveraging the JVs and exploring new partnerships. It sounds like you guys are starting to take a creative approach a little bit or at least considering a new approach to how to deal with that, because obviously there's the short term issue of oversupply, but there's a long term issue of the competitive dynamic changing a little bit. So is there a scenario where you guys consider maybe doing something a little more dramatic, like an airline within an airline strategy or something like that? Or is this plan to compete by using basic economy and segmenting your own cabin? And maybe something a little more tactical? Ed Bastian : Hunter, no, we have no intent to create an airline within an airline. Hunter Keay : And then can you maybe give us some color on how you guys use your route profitability reports and maybe how it's evolved in the last couple years? I think a lot of people are curious to know airlines and how Delta specifically plans for capacity. Is it a daily basis? Is it a weekly thing? Is there ever an element of strategic soft factors that are considered? Or is it simply, you get the route profitability reports, you see which routes are now losing money that used to make money and you trim back on those? I think maybe Glen, you want to talk about this. Just at a high level, can you sort of let us in to sort of how you plan in a changing demand environment? Thanks a lot. Glen Hauenstein : Hunter, that's a great question and of course there are a lot of elements that go into those decisions, including the market sizes, the relevant positions of the carrier, the long term sustainability and profitability potential of the market. But we adjust on a monthly basis, as you know and at about 3 to 4 months out, the less we touch the schedule, the better it is for our customers, because customers once they buy a ticket want you to fulfill that commitment of applying what they've purchased from you. So that's why it does take us a few months to ratchet up or ratchet down capacity in advance, once we see the trends developing. Operator : We will take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : I wonder from a high level could you talk about your fleet assumptions underlying the 1% growth rate in 2017? Any incremental deferrals or retirements underpinning that plan? Ed Bastian : Duane, we're not going to get specific on 2017 at all. We will get specific at the December 15 event that Jill mentioned. But right now we're still in the planning stages for 2017, so it'd be premature and speculative. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay. How about some of the recent press reports about incremental regional aircraft orders? Are those replacement in nature or are you getting additional scope relief in this agreement in principle? Ed Bastian : We have not made any incremental purchases of regional jet aircraft. There was certainly during the discussion with the pilots, whether we wanted to or not, but we're not planning on increasing our regional jet scope at this point. Operator : We will take our next question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Michael Linenberg : Two questions here. Glen, you called out I think Brexit as an issue. What did you see with your position at Virgin Atlantic? And what was the, I guess, benefit from Virgin Atlantic in the numbers this quarter? It looked like it may have run through the miscellaneous line. Can you highlight that? Glen Hauenstein : Well I'll let Paul highlight the numbers, but clearly the hit to revenue was primarily based and almost solely based on the depreciation of the currency. And so you know that's a pretty dramatic, more than 50% of the revenues in the joint venture we have with Virgin come as point of origin UK and are denominated in pounds, so when you have a big currency moves like that there's a dramatic change in the revenue profile.  Interestingly enough, we have not seen a lot of demand destruction, so that's the positive part. And we'll see how the winter, we're taking a very cautious approach with capacity into the UK, targeting it down in the mid single digits. Hopefully that will mitigate some of the drag we have from the currency. Michael Linenberg : And then I guess Paul, sort of the P&L impact, what it was this year versus a year ago in the miscellaneous line? Ed Bastian : Virgin is a private company so we're not going to give you the specific results of Virgin. But what I can tell you is it's largely consistent with what we had last third quarter. Michael Linenberg : And then just a quick one on the refinery. I think Paul, you indicated that it did lose $45 million for the quarter and I think publicly you've said that the estimate for the year is around $100 million? Is that still right? We've had some movement in fuel of late, so is that still a good number to use? Paul Jacobson : Yes, Mike it is. We've said on previous calls that we expect the full year refinery loss to be about $100 million. We're still in that range, even with the movement in prices, cracks have remained relatively consistent through this move up in crude. Operator : We will take our next question from David Vernon with Bernstein. David Vernon : Glen, you mentioned that you guys had changed or tweaked your revenue management practices which helped support the domestic RASM. Could you help us understand maybe what approach you took and how the market reacted to any of the changes you might have made externally? To how you're managing that yield in domestic? Glen Hauenstein : We had gotten some very complicated pricing strategies in place that were becoming very difficult for us to manage in a simplified fare environment and so we went to a much more, much higher reliance on revenue management and a little bit less reliance on the pricing structure. We're trying achieve pricing structure advantages. So that was all an internal, I couldn't tell you how our competitors reacted to that. I don't even know if they've seen it. David Vernon : So it was more of an internal action it that just resulted in a better outcome? Glen Hauenstein : Correct. David Vernon : Okay. And then maybe Paul, just as you think about longer term and I appreciate that you guys want to respect the negotiating process and not talk about the pilot contract, but if you think about the long term rate of sort of CASM ex fuel including profit sharing, directionally what sort of number should we think about that number being in the three to five year time frame? Paul Jacobson : David, good morning and first of all welcome to the sector. As Ed mentioned, we'll have more detail on 2017, but as we've talked about in our long term plans that we typically update in the May time frame, long term we're still committed to the 2% non-fuel CASM growth for the future. Or lower. David Vernon : Okay. So then as you think about that kind of playing into next year and obviously seeing a little bit above that on the pilot contract, that actually puts a little more short term pressure on the need to get the RASM up, right? Am I thinking about that correctly? Paul Jacobson : Certainly as what we articulated in our comments before the Q&A, the operating margin pressure that we see from fuel, from costs, etcetera is driving the continued urgency and challenges to get RASM higher. That's a prime focus irrespective of what we do in the cost structure overall. But we'll get into the 2017 and longer term as we talk about it at Investor Day in December. Operator : We will take our next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Jamie Baker : Question for Glen, so JPMorgan won't permit me to buy basic economy. It's a product that's not well suited for business travel, so whether I try to book it myself or through my agency, basic economy is walled off. Can't see it, can't buy it, fine with me, probably fine with you, I prefer to be kept in the upgrade lottery and have some flexibility on the day of departure. So my question is whether my employer here is the norm or the exception? I mean if you were to look at, I don't know, your top 50 corporate accounts, is it common for most of them to have walled off this product for employees? Or do you not even have the ability to tell? Glen Hauenstein : It's not uncommon for employers to wall that fare product off. Jamie Baker : And would you say the overwhelming majority do? The slight majority? Any color? Glen Hauenstein : A significant number of major corporations in the United States. How's that? I'm getting some counsel here watching the political debate go on, in what to say and what not to say. Jamie Baker : Very important lesson, though hopefully none of us need quite that level of schooling at this point. You've targeted -- so second question for Paul. You've targeted I guess 17% to 19% margins over the 2016 to 2018 timeframe. It looks like expectations for next year are actually below that, so the market doesn't exhibit a lot of confidence in this target. Fuel's heading higher, pilot costs heading higher. Arithmetically it looks like you have to have at least 3% RASM just to stay at the low end of the margin range for next year? Do you still have confidence that these targets are achievable? Or put differently, is it inevitable that Investor Day you have to revise them? Paul Jacobson : I will agree with you that the market has not expressed confidence in a lot of things that we're doing in the short term. We remain confident in our targets and our long term goals of what we're trying to achieve. We're talking about margin sustainability. We're talking about taking those steps to get there. We've known for a while now that fuel prices were trending higher and as we've talked about for multiple quarters, we're here. And that is fully expected and we believe the steps that we're taking are the necessary ones to preserve the foundation that we've created. Ed Bastian : The targets we put out there were just a few months ago, so there was nothing with what we put out that's changed. We expect to have a final deal, we expect the fuel prices to start to tick up, we expected to have RASM softness throughout this year. And you're right, the challenge is to get RASM back positive and we're optimistic that's exactly what we'll be doing. Glen Hauenstein : Could I add one thing, I think the one thing that would give us a lot of confidence, we do see a lot of green shoots like we saw in Latin and the domestic arena. And really if you look back at history, significantly lower fuel ultimately translates into lower fares. That's kind of a very high correlation over a long period of time, higher fuel turns into higher fares. The exact lag can vary, but it's usually in the 3 to 5 month category and as Paul says, we're facing higher fuel. And so we would expect seeing what we're seeing in the events and what we know, based on history of how long it takes for that to work its way back into the pricing structure, that it is right around the corner, we feel. Operator : We will take our next question from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company. Helane Becker : So on a unit revenue guidance for the fourth quarter, is there any way you can break down the percent related to FX and the percent related to calendar shift? Ed Bastian : The FX is not a big number, it's less than one point of negative impact. We don't have the calendar shift data because it's really, there's a lot of movement, that's why we try to give a 90-day forward kind of November through January view of what we see going on domestically. Helane Becker : And then my other question, just as you think about the New York area and the construction that's going on at LaGuardia and everything that's occurring, are you finding that your customers are shifting from LaGuardia to JFK? Or are there issues related to that, that are going to hold you back from being able to continue to expand the operation there? Ed Bastian : No, we're not. We're certainly well aware of some of the roadway challenges as the central terminal building construction started a couple months ago, but we're working with the port, we're working with the Governor's office to come up with better traffic patterns and no, we don't see any significant shift of markets. Operator : We will take our next question from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Joseph DeNardi : Glen, just a question on the Aeromexico relationship and the accounting around that. Can you just talk about, does that become a benefit from a PRASM standpoint, as some of the revenue flows through but the ASMs don't? If you could just walk us through how you plan to account for that once it closes? Paul Jacobson : So the Aeromexico, once that deal closes, assuming we get all the regulatory approvals and move forward which we expect will look a lot like the Virgin Atlantic accounting, so we'll have a piece of the joint venture that will flow through revenues and then we'll have a share of income which will flow through non-op. Joseph DeNardi : Okay, so the part that flows through revenue, will that become a tailwind for PRASM, since there won't be any corresponding ASMs for that? Glen Hauenstein : No, that's not the way it works. It's our reported unit revenues and then it goes into a different line item that's not in the reported unit revenues, (technical difficulty) key benefits. Joseph DeNardi : Okay. And then Paul, just a question on cash flows for this year, I know you guys don't guide on a full year basis, but are you still on track for the $8 billion to $9 billion target that you've given? Paul Jacobson : Yes, we're still largely on track as Ed talked about. We gave those numbers and figures back in May just a few months ago. We always project for higher fuel prices and we still feel good about our cash flow performance. Operator : We will take our next question from Julie Yates with Credit Suisse. Julie Yates : Glen, can you help frame expectations on the monthly PRASM cadence, just given all the calendar headwinds and noise that we'll see particularly in October? Glen Hauenstein : Yes, particularly October we'll be at the low end of the spectrum, actually below the quarterly guidance. November will be significantly above and December and January together, December will be significantly worse and January will be significantly better, as a lot of the holiday returns shift into the first couple of weeks of January. Julie Yates : Any updated thoughts on moving away from the monthlies, given all the noise it's been creating for the stock? Ed Bastian : We have no plans at this time, Julie. Julie Yates : Okay. And then one for Paul, Paul more specifically on 2017 in terms of the levers that you have to offset labor inflation and the headwind from slower unit growth, can you just remind us of some of the initiatives on the maintenance side and other opportunities that you have? Paul Jacobson : Sure, Julie, we can go into more detail at Investor Day, but as a reminder we're still in the middle innings of our upgauging strategy and we expect to continue to get those benefits in 2017 and beyond. That serves as the foundation, but we can get more specific on productivity initiatives and how we achieve those results tactically as we go through Investor Day in December. Operator : We will take our next question from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Dan McKenzie : Just a couple questions here. Glen, 1% growth in 2017, I'm wondering if you can share what the original plan was? Is that something that's less than what you had previously thought? Glen Hauenstein : This is the original plan for 2017. The planning season, we're just coming to the end of budget season or the beginning of budget season here and that's the template that we put out to the operating group. Dan McKenzie : Okay. And then Paul, given the 1% growth, I'm wondering if you can perhaps provide some more specificity on how we should think about aircraft and non-aircraft CapEx next year? I know you've put out a range before, but does the slower growth perhaps affect CapEx? Paul Jacobson : As Ed mentioned we'll provide more details on 2017 at Investor Day, but we're still consistent with what we shared a few months ago. Operator : We will take our next question from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Rajeev Lalwani : First question just on the positive RASM comment for early next year. How do you get comfortable with getting there, just given the fact that we've sort of been here before and had to push it out a couple of times? Or said another way, what's different this time? Glen Hauenstein : Well, the difference is the yields on close-in bookings. Yields in close-in booking volumes have significantly improved from where they were just six or eight weeks ago. And so as we went through the month, inside the month we were losing 3 to 4 points of unit revenues [indiscernible] and we get to a month say even, we would close the month minus 3% to 4% domestically. That number has significantly reduced. Now it's flat to minus 1% inside the month and so you see those trends sequentially and derivatively being improved week over week and month over month. So those trends continue to develop the way they have been, we see that that close-in inside the month would shift into positive territory the next few weeks and months here. Ed Bastian : I think the other thing to note is that capacity levels are lower than they've been all year long and will stay there until we get to the unit revenues we need and fuel prices have also firmed up which is providing a pricing floor. So I think we've got a lot of change we see happening in our specific circumstances. Rajeev Lalwani : And then a quick follow-up as it relates to the midpoint of your guidance, does that reflect close-in continuing to improve or that strength remaining as you look through the quarter? Glen Hauenstein : It assumes what we see today. It does not assume further deterioration or improvement. Operator : We will take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi Syth : Follow-up question on the pilot cost side of things. I know you don't want to talk about the contract or anything, but if it does pass within 4Q, is the accounting for that going to be reflected in the fourth quarter EPS? Or I was just kind of curious how the retroactive pay will be treated if the contract is ratified? Ed Bastian : If the contract is ratified, Savi and if there is a retro component to it, yes, in the fourth quarter there would be an accounting. But right now we're not making any assumptions or making any comment on it. Savi Syth : And then just if I may ask I know that you probably won't comment on some of the news out there about interest in Avianca, but just wondering if you could provide a little bit of insight into what you would gain from a closer relationship with Avianca? Or just what you might be missing in that part of the region and what you could do to address it? Ed Bastian : Your earlier premise is correct. We're not going to speculate on Avianca. Savi Syth : Or maybe if you can provide a little bit more color on maybe what you're missing in and I'm guessing because you seem to have a good relationship with GOL and have access to Brazil, so is it more, what's missing in Latin America from Delta's network? Ed Bastian : Well, we've got a great partner in Mexico, we've got a great partner in Brazil, we've got a great partner in Argentina. We don't have a partner relationship in Central America. Operator : We will take our next question from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Jack Atkins : Just a follow-up on an earlier question first here, if you could help me reconcile your comments around close-in yields improving over the last 6 to 8 weeks, but I think the September domestic RASM was down 2.5% I believe you said earlier? The original expectation I think on the last call was for flattish, so if you can help me reconcile positive close-in commentary relative to underperformance in September? Glen Hauenstein : Minus 2.5% was significantly better than we had been doing and our expectations were that it would be slightly better than that, but it did in our -- missed flattish by a point or two. It's very difficult to call an industry where 40% of your revenues come inside of 30 days and so that's one of the reasons I think that there's a lot of speculation is, can we get it done? And I think all we can tell you is the trends that we see and the trends that we see continue to improve and with those improving trends you would expect us to be and the macro backdrop of higher fuel as Ed points out, there seems to be everything lining up here for us to move beyond the minus 2.5% to a more flattish and then into positive territory as we close the year out. Jack Atkins : And then just a follow-up on that, can you speak to what you're seeing in terms of your business travel demand and yields there? Have you seen any sort of lingering effects at all from the IT issues in August? Thank you. Steve Sear : To your question, we still see the steady volumes which is encouraging and some of the ongoing yield pressure and we're continuing to grow share through the period. Jill Sullivan-Greer: We've got time for one more question from the analysts. Operator : We will take our next question from Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Darryl Genovesi : Glen, just wondering you commented that the close-in stuff was looking a little bit better. What do you think is driving that? Is it an improvement in corporate demand? Or is it moves that the industry has made to try to limit dilution by holding less inventory towards the end of the booking curve? Or can you not tell? Glen Hauenstein : I think that the fares that we're realizing inside of 21 days are improving generally and the question is they are improving at different rates, corporate managed versus unmanaged and I think they are at slightly different rates, with managed being slightly below unmanaged. But the general trends are that inside the month now, we're seeing a more robust fare. Jill Sullivan-Greer: That's going to wrap up the analyst portion of the call and I will now turn it over to Kevin Shinkle, our Chief Communications Officer for the media portion. Kevin Shinkle : Thanks, Jill. Welcome to the media portion of our call. We'll have about 10 minutes for questions, so please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Noah, can you please provide the instructions again on how to register and ask a question? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question today from Jeffrey Dastin with Reuters. Jeffrey Dastin : How does Delta expect the U.S. market to change once other legacy airlines implement their version of basic economy? And how would that impact Delta, if at all? Ed Bastian : Jeffrey, we're not going to speculate on future pricing trends. Right now we feel we've got a good product in the market and we'll see what happens. Jeffrey Dastin : And similar to Hunter's question, what is your long term strategy for fending off low cost, long haul carriers from Europe? Glen Hauenstein : I think we have to look at our entire service offering and ensure that we're supplying what the market wants to buy. I think what we know is Delta has a very, very strong brand and much stronger than some of the ULCCs and that people would prefer to fly with us than they would on some of the unknown non-brand names. But in many cases we don't have similar configuration, mixes, product offerings and I think that's where we're going to be looking.  You don't need to create an airline within airline, you just need to adjust to what people want to buy in the marketplace. And the closer we can get to what our customers want to buy in every sector, the more successful we're going to be and Transatlantic is no exception to the rule. Jeffrey Dastin : Sorry, just to clarify, would this include basic economy for international? Glen Hauenstein : It includes all kinds of fare products, it includes cabins we don't have today and I think that's the exercise we're going through is to see what do people really want to buy and what are they paying for it and how do we capitalize on moving, not providing something that Delta wants to provide, but providing something customers want to buy. Operator : We will take our next question from Doug Cameron with Wall Street Journal. Doug Cameron : I'll stick with passenger experience too, since I think we've flogged PRASM to death earlier. Incidents involving both passenger and crew electronic devices on flights have been on the rise quite aside from what happened with Samsung. At the same time, the regulations for both transport and tackling incidents, the guidance remains unchanged. If you look at what airlines are doing and in some ways they're exacerbating the problem, more lie-flat seats which can crush phones which don't like to be crushed, more power ports which keeps all those battery chargers charged up. So Ed, I'd like to ask you, how much of a challenge is this for the industry right now? And what is Delta specifically doing to keep ahead or to mitigate the problems that are basically increasing? Ed Bastian : Well Doug, it is a challenge but I don't want it to be blown out of proportion either. We've had a very few single digit number of incidents occur. We're certainly reminding our passengers of the requirements, we're educating our crews, we're putting some additional safety elements on board the cabin to help mitigate a smoke situation. But it's not fundamentally different than challenges that we've had for some time. We're aware of the concerns around lithium batteries and we're very mindful of that, safety is always our most important concern. Q - Doug Cameron : For the additional safety measures you've taken on board? The elements, sorry, you said elements, what does that mean? Gil West : So what we've done is of course really the target training with our flight crews along with equipment. There are some other modifications that we're adding with containment bags as an example, that with any device that did experience a lithium battery fire you can put it in a containment bag that would certainly contain any possible scenario. But there's already equipment on board and has been that's capable with dealing with any of these situations. Operator : We will take our next question from Michael Sasso with Bloomberg News. Michael Sasso : The announcement the other day about Richard retiring completely from the company I think caught a number of people off guard and there wasn't much in the release about why. Can you speak to anything about the motivation of why he stepped off so quickly? Certainly there's a lot of speculation about it. Ed Bastian : Michael, I'm not going to speculate for Richard other than to say this was all consistent with the plan that we have talked to. I mentioned earlier today that he's given myself as the new CEO and Frank Blake as the new lead Director about six months of transition to make certain everything on the succession was going well. We do think everything is going well and he concluded it was his time to retire, so this was fully anticipated. Operator : We will take our next question from Ted Reed with The Street. Ted Reed : Ed, you said in opening that this is the weakest revenue environment in recent memory. Were you just referring to RASM trends or to something else? Ed Bastian : I was talking of pricing trends that we've seen this year. Ted Reed : Just pricing is really weak because of -- Ed Bastian : Demand has been strong, but it's related to weak pricing. Ted Reed : Okay. And secondly, recently Doug Parker said that the only goal that remains in talks regarding the Mid East three carriers is to eliminate this fifth freedom flights like the Milan flight. Is that your feeling? And what type of progress do you think the State Department is making? Ed Bastian : We have reason to believe the State Department is making progress. We're not going to get in front of the State Department by telling them what they need to do specifically, but freezing and/or eliminating fifths would be a great start. Operator : We will take our next question from Edward Russell with Flightglobal. Edward Russell : With the further 747 reductions, could you confirm how many 747s Delta will have at the end of this year? Glen Hauenstein : Five flying. Edward Russell : Sorry, five? Glen Hauenstein : Sorry, five flying. Edward Russell : Five flying, great, thank you very much. Kevin Shinkle : Okay and with that I think we're gone through everybody. Thank you and we will conclude our third quarter earnings call. Thanks again. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

My name is Dana and I will be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jill Greer : Thanks Dana. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for our December quarter call. Joining us from Atlanta today are our CEO Ed Bastian, our President Glen Hauenstein and our birthday boy Paul Jacobson. Our entire leadership team is here in the room for the Q&A session. Ed will open the call and give an overview of our financial performance. Glen will then address the revenue environment and Paul will conclude with a review of our cost performance and cash flow. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I will turn the call over to Ed. Ed Bastian : Thanks Jill. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we reported our December quarter and full year results, including a December quarter pretax profit of $923 million and EPS of $0.82, in line with consensus. Normalized for the out of quarter cost of the new pilot contract, our pretax income was $1.3 billion with a 15% pretax margin and EPS of $1.16. This rounds out what has been a record-breaking year across-the-board for Delta, financially, operationally and for our customers. Financially, we produced $6.1 billion of pretax profits, 16.5% operating margin and a 26% pretax return on invested capital. It looks like we will be the only major to have grown its operating margin in 2016. We generated $7 billion in operating cash flow and nearly $4 billion of pretax [loans] [ph] we used to reduce our adjusted net debt to $6.1 billion, achieved an investment grade credit rating and returned over $3 billion to our owners. Operationally, we ran the best operation in the industry by a wide margin and we continue to raise the bar on ourselves. We ended 2016 with 241 days of no mainline cancellations and 81 days with no system cancellations, a level of performance that no airline has ever come close to producing on our scale. As we are doing that, at the same time we are regularly keeping on-time arrivals at nearly 87% and improving our bag scores by 13%, incredible work by Gil and the entire operations team. We know that our operational reliability is a key driver of customer satisfaction and one reason why more customers than ever prefer flying Delta. With our operating performance, combined with the investments we have made in our fleet, products and facilities, we have seen a consistent improvement in our net promoter scores hitting a record 44% in November. All of this is due to the outstanding efforts of 80,000 Delta people and it's an incredible honor to recognize that with over $1 billion in profit sharing for the third year in a row. Sharing the success of the company with our people is one of the things that makes Delta truly different. The major theme at our Investor Day last month was the sustainability and durability of our business. And with fuel and labor costs rising, we must grow unit revenues if we were to sustain our margins. So we are pleased to have seen our fourth quarter unit revenues come in better than not only our original guidance but also better than the guidance we gave in mid-December. While it's taken longer than we wanted to get here, we are cautiously optimistic that the revenue environment finally appears to have turned the corner and after a flat RASM in the month of December we expect unit revenues to turn positive for the first quarter. That said, we are going to remain conservative with our capacity until we see two things. In the short term, we will need to see a further firming of current revenue trends. And over the medium to longer term, we will keep our capacity in check until we are achieving our 17% to 19% operating margin target because as we also said at Investor Day, 2017 is going to be a bit of a transition year. While revenues are on a better trajectory, we expect margins will decline 100 to 200 basis points year-on-year in 2017, given the current forward curve and the expense of our labor cost reset. However, we expect the margin pressure to peak in the March quarter and by the back half of this year, we would be in a position to expand margins as our unit revenue base improves. This should be a very good setup for 2018 and beyond. So as we look ahead, I am optimistic. By executing flawlessly against our core principles, we are confident that we are the right path to return to an improving margin trajectory later in the year. First, we will continue to be America's best-run airline focusing on producing the best operation every single day for our customers. Next, we will continue to strengthen our brand, improving our product and service in the eyes of our customers and generating a sustainable revenue premium versus our competition. We will also expand our global reach through equity stakes, joint ventures and partnerships around the world. I am looking forward to completing our Aeromexico tender offer in the first half of the year. Finally, we will maintain our solid foundation with cost and capital discipline, making sure that every dollar we spend is put to good use without burdening the business with high leverage. Put together, this will create the sustainable returns and cash flows that our owners expect over the long term delivered by the very best team of airline professionals in the business. And with that, I am happy to turn the call over the Glen. Glen Hauenstein : Thanks, Ed, and good morning everyone. I want to start this morning by thanking the Delta people for taking great care of our customers everyday. It's your efforts that make Delta grand and drive our premium to the industry. I also want to give a special thanks for our commercial team for all of their very hard work that got us to flat RASM for the month of December and should return us to positive unit revenues in the first quarter. While total demand remained strong throughout 2016, weak business yields were prevalent and drove RASM declines. To address this, in the December quarter, we adjusted our revenue management approach and capped our capacity growth below 1%. Following the election in November, we began seeing improvements in business demand and the firming of business yields. These trends continued into December, which was the first month in over two years that yields improved on a year-over-year basis. As a result, our fourth quarter unit revenues were down 2.7%, better than both our initial guidance and the updated outlook we gave at Investor Day. As we look ahead, we are encouraged by the trends that we see. At a macro level, consumer confidence remains strong and demand remains solid. And the outlook for corporate travel is positive. In our most recent survey, 85% of our corporate customers expect that they will maintain or increase travel spend in the first quarter. This figure is up nine points from the previous outlook than last quarter and is the best outlook we have seen in two years. In addition, we are maintaining our commitment to moderate capacity growth until we see further firming of the current revenue trends. Our capacity will decline about half a point in the first quarter of 2017 but excluding the impact of leap year, our run rate will continue to track below 1%. Finally, while domestic business yields have turned positive, there is still a long way to go and a great opportunity for us before they are back to historical levels. These points, combined, give us confidence that we are on the right path and we expect system revenue RASM to increase 0% to 2% for the March quarter with February and March stronger than January. Geographically, our path to positive RASM is heavily dependent on the domestic entity, given it's relative [indiscernible] in our network. For the December quarter, domestic unit revenues were down 3%, which is a four point improvement from what we saw during the third quarter and the momentum is continuing. More than half of our domestic network is currently realizing positive RASM today, up from 20% we saw during the summer period. And our network investments continue to drive results with JFK, Los Angeles and Seattle notable bright spot for us as each posted positive RASM for the December quarter and have superior forward trends. With the demand in yield improvement we are experiencing, we now expect domestic PRASM for the November through January period to be slightly positive versus our prior outlook of flat. We also expect that our domestic unit revenues will be positive for the March quarter. We will continue to be prudent about our capacity increases as we work to maintain our revenue momentum and we expect domestic capacity to be up 1.5% in the first quarter. In addition to the benefits we anticipate from adjustments to our revenue management strategy, we will also begin lapping the domestic close in pricing weakness we started experiencing around February last year. Internationally, we are seeing trends improve. While there are pockets of weakness around the world, we are taking the appropriate action to ensure our results continue moving in the right direction. International capacity was down 2% for the December quarter and will be down 4% in the first quarter of 2017. Our LatAm unit revenues improved 5% year-over-year in the December quarter, the second consecutive positive result for the region and we anticipate the momentum will continue in the first quarter. Brazil have led the turnaround in the region, but each sub-entity in Latin America has posted positive year-over-year RASM for the first time since the third quarter of 2011. We see momentum in LatAm continuing as we move through 2017. In the Pacific, we continue to execute on our multiyear restructuring which deemphasizes our hub in Tokyo and continues to build on our partner hubs in Shanghai and Seoul. As a result of these changes, the spool of new domestic services and a challenging capacity environment, our Pacific entity unit revenues declined 9% on 6% less capacity. Roughly half of this RASM decline was driven by lower Yen hedges on a year-over-year basis. We expect fourth quarter of 2016 will mark the trough for our Pacific unit revenue performance as our restructuring efforts take hold and industry capacity growth moderates. Specifically, we expect a significant capacity growth in the U.S. to Shanghai and Beijing market, which has occurred over the last several years to slow in 2017 as both the Chinese and the U.S. carriers will reach their respective frequency caps this summer. Turning to the Atlantic. Our European portfolio remains challenged due to industry capacity and balance and currency headwinds. While our Transatlantic unit revenues declined 6% for the quarter, the region still produced one of its most profitable December quarters in history. As we have seen the industry fare environment evolve, we have been thoughtful and proactive in our capacity adjustments and are planning 1Q 2017 Transatlantic capacity to be down 3%. In 2017, we will continue to build on our presence in our strategically advantaged hubs in London, Paris and Amsterdam, while deemphasizing high EU point-of-sale markets. And as we move into the summer season, we expect point-of-sale U.S. demand to be at record levels, which will help mitigate the point-of-sale European weakness. For our international network broadly, further strengthening of the U.S. dollar does pose some incremental risk to 2017. However, we are well positioned to mitigate these potential headwinds though our capacity and fleet actions. At current rates, our year-over-year foreign exchange impact in 1Q of 2017 is expected to be a $25 million headwind. With positive RASM in our line of sight, our next priority goes to consistently producing topline growth as we return to margin expansion in the back half of this year. To this end, it is our focus on the customer and our brand that will allow us to maintain our momentum and ultimately drive a better revenue outcome. Branded fares remain a huge opportunity for us and will continue expanding and merchandising our suite of products that allow customers to tailor their travel experience. This year we expect to generate an incremental $300 million in revenue from our branded fare initiatives. Our newest product, Delta Premium Select will debut in the first half of 2017 providing elevated service and improved amenities on Delta's longest flights. And the expansion of basic economy will also continue in 2017. Today basic economy is over 40% of the domestic markets and we expect to have full domestic coverage by mid-2017. The broader international rollout will follow and we expect to be complete with basic economy in our entire network by 2018. We are expanding the breadth of our products in the marketplace. We are investing in technology in commercial improvements to advance the way we offer these products. We want to consistently have the right product at the right price at the right time for our customers. We continue to develop our international partnerships and we were pleased to be granted antitrust immunity by the DOT for our proposed JV with Aeromexico in December. We expect the JV will become effective on April 1. We are excited about the opportunity that this presents both airlines in the largest business travel market between the U.S. and Latin America. Finally, we will continue to invest roughly 50% of cash flow back into the business to improve the customer experience. Whether it's new aircraft in our fleet, our new all-suite business class product, improvements to the Sky Club or the investments we are making in innovation like RFID or other customer facing technology, Delta continues to invest in having an industry-leading product. The opportunities to drive additional revenues are great and I cannot be more excited about the business in 2017 and beyond. And with that, I would like to turn it over to our birthday boy and CFO, Paul Jacobson. Paul Jacobson : Thanks Glen and good morning everybody. Thank you for joining us. Once again, this quarter Delta team was able to demonstrate that despite challenges and cost pressure, we have built a durable business that can deliver consistent results. Total operating expenses increased $573 million in the quarter, primarily driven by $475 million of pressure from the new pilot contract with $380 million of that being related to the retro payment back to January 1. Nonfuel CASM increased 10.6% in the quarter, roughly eight points of that pressure driven by the pilot agreement in the quarter. Excluding the portion of the contract expense not related to the quarter, Delta's normalized nonfuel cost increased approximately 4% That said, fourth quarter saw a bit more cost escalation than we have been seeing so far this year. In addition to the impact of wage increases related to the ratified pilot agreement, there were timing issues in light items such as maintenance, contracted services and rents and landing fees that drove expense pressure in 4Q after having provided benefits in earlier quarters. However, fourth quarter and our full year results are consistent with the expectations we have had all year. For the March quarter, we expect nonfuel cost to increase 5% to 7% on a reported basis as cost pressures in 2017 will be weighted towards the first half of the year. Normalizing 1Q 2016 cost to include the portion of the pilot contract related to that period, our nonfuel CASM is expected to increase in the 3% to 5% range in the first quarter, although we will strive to be in the low end of that range. For the full year, we continue to expect our nonfuel unit cost to increase in the 2% to 3% range on capacity growth of 1% due to higher maintenance volumes, greater depreciation expense, reduced asset utilization and the continued investments we are making in our people. Turning to fuel. Our total fuel expense declined by $240 million or about 15% despite higher crude oil prices, as we lapped hedge losses from 2015. While crude has moved higher, crack spreads have remained low, which has helped keep jet fuel prices relatively in check for the airline with pressures result at the refinery which lost $40 million for the quarter as expected. For 2017, we expect our fuel cost pressures will be weighted for the first half of the year. As you remember, during the first quarter of last year crude prices averaged $35 a barrel and hit a low of $26 in late January before they began to increase steadily from there. So for the first quarter, we expect our all-in fuel price to be in the range of $1.68 to $1.73 per gallon which is up roughly 30% year-over-year, hopefully the largest headwind from higher fuel we will see all year. With similar timing on our nonfuel cost pressures and the pace of our unit revenue improvements Glen discussed earlier, this should result in a March quarter operating margin of 11% to 13%. As we move through the year, with our cost increases moderating and our RASM trajectory improving, we should be in a position to see margins stabilize in the second quarter and begin expanding again by the second half. Moving on to cash flow. We generated more than $1.2 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter. Consistent with our balanced capital deployment strategy, a little over $600 million, roughly half of that cash flow, went directly back into the business for aircraft modifications, facility upgrades and technology improvements. We expect core capital spending will be roughly $800 million in the first quarter, largely driven by aircraft related spend. Also in the March quarter and consistent with prior years, we have already contributed $1.1 billion to the pension plan. With the DOT grant of antitrust immunity for our proposed joint venture with Aeromexico in mid-December, we now expect the tender offer to occur in the second quarter of 2017. While we continue to make investments in our business for the future, we are also strengthening our balance sheet as we work towards our $4 billion net adjusted debt goal for 2020. We ended the December quarter with net debt of $6.1 billion, down roughly $500 million from yearend 2015. We generated $640 million in free cash flow and returned $450 million of that to our shareholders in the quarter. For the year, we generated nearly $4 billion in free cash flow, more than $3 billion of which went back to our owners after investment in the airline. That is roughly an 80% return rate and our goal continues to be to return at least 70% of our free cash flow to our owners annually. Looking back on 2016, it was a year in which the uniqueness of the Delta model and our disciplined approach to the business allowed us to deliver a result that was consistent with 2015 despite a lot of headwinds. I would like to thank each and every member of the Delta family for their hard work this year as we continue to show investors why they can rely on Delta and the Delta family. As we move forward into 2017, we are committed to staying focused on cost and our balanced capital strategies because that is what differentiates Delta and that is what will provide for sustainability next year and over the long-term. With that, I will turn it back to Jill. Jill Greer : Thanks Ed, Glen and Paul. And we will now go to questions from the analysts. Dana, if you can provide the instructions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Jamie Baker : Hi. Good morning everybody. First question for Paul. I just wanted to delve a bit further into the comment that second half margins would show year-on-year expansion. I think for the fourth quarter, that's a no-brainer given you booked the entire incremental pilot expense in fourth quarter 2016. If you had spread the retro payment over the quarters in 2016, would your comment that second half margins should show expansion, would that still be the most probable outcome? Paul Jacobson : Good morning Jamie. Thanks for that question. Yes, that is what is the most probable outcome. As we go through 2017, we are running the business on a normalized basis. That's the run rate of the salaries and wages. So as we look at the effects of the pilot contract in 2016, we are trying to normalize for that flow and we feel confident that we will be able to achieve that in the second half of the year, even as we look through that adjustment. Jamie Baker : Okay. That's helpful. And a second question for Glen. Where are we in terms of achieving the 100% of domestic markets equipped, for a lack of a better term, with basic economy? And more importantly, I suppose, when you convert a market to one that does offer basic economy, what sort of RASM impact does that have? Should we assume that it's the basic economized markets, for a lack of a better term, that are contributing to that statement that you made of half of your domestic market experiencing positive RASM? Or is that reading too much into it? Glen Hauenstein : I think that's reading too much into it. The huge driver in markets returning to positive unit revenues is getting momentum back in the business yields. And even if you experience a 60% sell up rate which is slightly higher than we have experienced in the past, let's say 50% to make the math easy on an average sell up of $40, you are not talking about a huge amount of money. I think it's more of a competitive tool than it is a huge value driver in the long run. So what we are really excited about are the branded fares on the premium side, the continuation of more usage in first class, continuation of the higher branded products like Comfort Plus and our new Premium Select that we are introducing later on this year. Jamie Baker : Got it. Paul and Glen, thank you very much. I appreciate it. Operator : And we will take our next question from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company. Conor Cunningham : Hi guys. It's actually Conor in for Helane. I realize you made some cuts on the Atlantic side. Can you just discuss what gives you confidence that the Atlantic will eventually sort itself out? I mean I realize that there's seems like there's going to be significant low cost growth for years to come. How does Delta and those JV partners expect to mitigate any market share losses to those guys? Thanks. Glen Hauenstein : Well, I am not sure that we would say we are going to mitigate any share losses. I think what we are going to do is preserve and accelerate our margins. And I think that's where having partner hubs and becoming more and more reliant on the partner hubs where we have competitive advantages is a key to our strength moving forward. Clearly also in the segmentation of products, we have further segmentation to do and I think that's one of the reasons we look at the products we are introducing in the marketplace like Premium Select. If you look at what Norwegian flight, they don't have flatbeds. If you look at what a lot about the ultra low cost carriers, they haven't made that investment in those types of products. And we need to adjust to that new paradigm as high quality products for leisure customers who are willing to pay more than just standard coach fares. So we have some adjustments to make in our model. We will continue to work with our partners to make sure that our model is more durable and I think we have a very good hand in Europe in the long run. Conor Cunningham : Has there been some discussion of potentially bringing basic economy to the international side at all? Or is it just still a domestically focused product at this point? Glen Hauenstein : In the call today, we said that we will have it ubiquitous in our entire system by 2018. So it will be in all of our international markets. Conor Cunningham : Great. Thanks. Operator : And we will take our next question from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Mike Linenberg : Yes. Hi. Good morning everybody. Glen, I want to go back on the markets domestically. You called out a couple of airports as notable bright spots. And I think you said that they had superior sort of demand trends going forward. You called out LAX, Seattle, JFK. Where's LaGuardia in that? Is it New York that you are seeing? Or is it just specifically JFK? And LaGuardia maybe isn't strong enough to warrant a call out. Can you just comment on that? Glen Hauenstein : In LaGuardia, as you know, one of the key business markets, Boston LaGuardia, has a new entrant who has extraordinarily low fares, which is putting a little bit of pressure on LaGuardia as well as all of that new service from New York to Florida. So I would say there is little bit more pressure on LaGuardia than there on Kennedy right now. Mike Linenberg : Okay. Thank you. And then just a question to Paul. Paul, where are you, I am not sure if you have the numbers yet but with respect to the pension, where that liability, the under funding, where that ended at yearend 2016. Can you update us on that? Paul Jacobson : Sure Mike and good morning. Mike Linenberg : Good morning. Paul Jacobson : We ended 2016 with a pension liability of about $10.6 billion of the unfunded liability. That's down a little more than $0.5 billion from 2015. The rate improvements that we saw towards the end of the year largely offset the declines that we saw through the middle part of year. So it's up substantially from what the peak liability would have been intra-year, but the year-over-year change was moderated a little bit. Mike Linenberg : Okay. Very good. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Dan McKenzie : Hi. Good morning. Thanks. If I am interpreting the press release literally, it implies essentially no sequential improvement in unit revenue in the second quarter and from where I sit that, of course, doesn't make sense just given the value pricing that was going on in the second quarter. So to get at your commentary, are you assuming a more conservative fuel price than is implied today by the futures for the stabilization of margins in the second quarter? Ed Bastian : Hi Dan. It's Ed. I don't know what your calculus is for the second quarter. But I would say your model has got some challenges in it. So maybe you can take that offline. Dan McKenzie : Well, okay. Well, I guess the point I am just trying to make is, we should continue to expect sequential improvement in unit revenue in the second quarter? Ed Bastian : That was what I was inferring by my comment. Dan McKenzie : Yes. Okay. Perfect. And then second question here, Los Angeles was highlighted at Investor Day for infrastructure improvement. And I am just wondering where you are at now just in terms of gates and where would you go with respect to gates after the improvements? And what kind of growth does that potentially unlock for Delta at Los Angeles? Glen Hauenstein : We are substantially constrained at LAX today. We have, I believe, 15 gates currently in terminals five and six and when we get to terminals two and three, we have the possibility to come close to doubling the gate pods but it is going to take some time as we redevelop terminals two and three. That's not overnight. And it will also take a little bit of the pressure off of the turns on the gate today. We turned terminals five and six to highest levels in the system and once we get a better gate pod, we will be able to reduce some of the congestion at the airport. So, we will have more gates but that doesn't necessarily mean more direct flights as a result. But net net, we absolutely will be increasing our footprint and our capacity in LAX over the next few years. Dan McKenzie : Would that primarily --? Glen Hauenstein : One of the big advantages to us today is we are not co-located with our partners in Los Angeles and this swap from terminals five and six to terminals two and three allows us to co-locate with our partners on a much more aggressive timeline. So we won't be busing people around the year or asking them to walk outside and go between terminals and really that drives a significant amount of value in the short run to be able to accomplish at a faster rate than we would otherwise do, particularly as we look to carriers like integrating with Aeromexico. So we are very excited about that in the short run. Dan McKenzie : Okay. Thanks guys. Operator : And we will take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just from a regulatory policy perspective, obviously very early days here, but maybe you could list for us your top three opportunities and risks you see. What are the potential changes on the table that you are most excited about? Ed Bastian : Hi Duane, this is Ed. There's a number of things we are excited about. One of the things we are very excited about is the potential investment opportunities of the new administration, talk a lot about improving in airport facilities we have been doing, a considerable amount of investment alongside our public partners in LaGuardia, LA, Seattle, Salt Lake, Atlanta, but the ability to continue to work with the federal government to drive improvements to the infrastructure is clearly a big deal for us. We are very excited about the opportunities to present our case relative to the Middle Eastern situation with all the growth that those carriers have brought to this country on a subsidized basis where we are competing against governments, not the other airlines and the opportunity to let the Trump administration know how we can do, as an industry, a better job of protecting U.S. jobs and U.S. opportunities going forward and also protecting trade deals and enforcing trade deals that are being violated in the present time. There's tax benefits that are being discussed. There is regulatory changes being discussed, whether it's in the RFS on RINs potentially or other means. So there is a pretty good list of opportunities that we are -- I think we have already provided some input into the transition team and it will take some time over the next few months as things become a little more clear and individuals are staffed into new roles, but we are very excited. Duane Pfennigwerth : I appreciate that. And then just on the airport investments that you are making in the New York area and it's tough, I guess, for me to know how much of this is conceptual versus committed at this point, but what is the annual investment that you have committed to at this point? How long term are these projects? And how should we be thinking about your longer term cost structure at these airports in New York? Thanks for taking the questions. Ed Bastian : LaGuardia, it's premature to be talking, be giving numbers our because we don't have signed leases in place yet and we are working with various entities there. You are not going to see a significant spike in CapEx, if that's your question. We are doing our best to work with various public partnerships and private partnerships to minimize that but no question, as the airport facilities come online you will see increase in the cost of the facility and we also think you will see improvement in revenues and the efficiency of the facility as well. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thank you. Operator : And not take our next question from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Rajeev Lalwani : Hi. Thanks for the time. Actually a question for Paul and kind of following up on what Duane was asking. With all the chatter out there around border adjustment taxes, do you see the potential for maybe higher aircraft CapEx as a result of import tariffs or anything like that? And then on corporate tax reform, what do you think the opportunity is for you either directly or indirectly, if you can, Paul? Paul Jacobson : Sure. Good morning Rajeev. On the first question, it's way too premature to speculate on what any specific impacts might be to the airlines. We are following it closely as everybody else is. I think generally speaking, tax reform is good for the airline industry. It is a U.S. centric business model and one that, we believe, it continues to be very, very important for the U.S. infrastructure. So we feel optimistic that we can a net beneficiary of any tax reform and we are eager to see what the results are. Rajeev Lalwani : And, Glen, a quick question for you, I guess more of a clarification. As we look ahead, would it be fair to say that capacity is more or less going to move in tandem with margin strength? Or should we assume that capacity kind of remains in check until you get margins to that targeted 15% to 17% range or so? Glen Hauenstein : I didn't quite understand the difference between those two questions you pose, but I think that's what you see is with a higher dollar and with the competitive environment we have internationally, we have been decreasing our offerings internationally in order to achieve margins. And as we get there, we would start looking at flattening our capacity and then eventually growing it. Hope that answers your question. Rajeev Lalwani : I guess I was asking, is capacity going to stay in check until margins get higher? Or should we look at --? Glen Hauenstein : Absolutely. That's the plan. Rajeev Lalwani : Okay. Thank you sir. Operator : We will take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi Syth : Good morning. Paul, a happy birthday. Just had a question on the cost side of things. Outside of labor costs, could you talk about the items that are placing the greatest pressure on unit cost this year and maybe how they progress through the quarters? Paul Jacobson : Sure. Thanks, Savi, for the birthday wishes. You know, a gift would be not asking a question about CASM, but the biggest drivers, as we talked about in the calls for the first quarter and then what we saw in the fourth quarter is really timing of maintenance events. As you know, we tend to seasonally do that a lot in the winter and the off-peak periods. But it's just a natural progression of things as you go throughout the year. And now we feel like as we start to normalize the business and go through the summer periods, we expect to see a lot of the continued benefits from upgauging throughout the business to moderate some of that cost pressure in the first half and get us to the point where we feel confident that were in the 2% to 3% range for the full year as we talked about. Ed Bastian : Savi, this is Ed. If I could add to that, I know there is some choppiness in year as the quarters rollout. But if you look at the full year of 2% to 3%, I would say, very high level, half of that's due to the labor reset that we have talked about and the other half is due to reduced utilization of the is run rate of airline's capacity. If you look at the reduced run rates of capacity, there is certainly a knock-on effect of nonfuel costs. I would say, high level, those are the two big drivers. Savi Syth : Got it. Helpful. And then just a question on the product side. I know product segmentation has been kind of an important part of this, I think, the change in the industry as you kind of move away from having a commoditized product and I think customers have definitely benefited, improved operations and different things like that. But I guess, do you have a litmus test that we don't repeat the sins of the past where you add a lot of frills on to the product and then come a downturn you have to take that away? How do you, in your thinking about introducing food in economy on trans-con and things like that, just what's the litmus test as to the sustainability of that and maybe the demand for it? Glen Hauenstein : Savi, I think we respond to demand and I think in different parts of the economic cycle, different things are important to different customers in each segment. And that's why I think as we continue to refine our customer segmentation, we want to continue to provide what customers are willing to pay for us. And in this part of the economic cycle, they are with consumer confidence side, with the consumer flush with cash, they are willing to pay for more frills. And you know, we make a mistake as an industry when we anticipate or try and be in the minds of consumers as opposed to responding to what's important at point in time. And I think, as a successful airline through all parts of the cycle, we are going to have to continue to monitor what's important to customers, what they want from us at that time. And that's what we are doing today. Savi Syth : So you could see in downtowns, where you do cut back on certain things -- Glen Hauenstein : Absolutely. If fares become more relevant to customers than some of the amenities we put on, absolutely. I don't think you box yourself into the fact to say that what customers want today is what they want five years from now. Savi Syth : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : Thank you. Good morning. Glen, I know you said you are obviously optimistic about the outlook for corporate spend based on your survey but is there a practical risk that your corporate accounts may have reset their annual travel budgets a lot lower if they base it on the last couple year spend where corporate air fares were down so much? I don't think this would be uncommon with what's happened in prior airline cycles. So maybe you get this pop in the first half on higher spend but as the year progresses some of your maybe more midsize corporate accounts end up bumping into the ceilings of their annual travel budget because it was based off of lower dollar amount in a lower fare environment. So is that something that you have seen before? Is that something you are considering or planning for as we move through the year? Glen Hauenstein : Well, Hunter, I think if you look at the travel spend on a lot of corporates, particularly in major lane segments of domestic U.S., they are considered to be the primary business segments, that the fares were down 30%, 40% on historical basis. And I don't think we have to get a significant, we are not expecting them to go back to the historical levels in our current plan. This is a journey. It's not a race. And so I do think that if the economy holds out, which we are forecasting today that it will and business continues to travel which we are forecasting it will, that the opportunity to raise fares in that environment with a lower level of capacity offering from the industry is significant and it gets better as we move throughout the year because the fare has got to be so low for business travel by midyear last year. If you take one of the primary business markets in Atlanta to City X, that used to be $750 for a day trip, it got down to $119 for a day trip today. It is sitting at $350 for a day trip. Could it go to $400? Could it go to $450? We see no propensity to decrease travel going from $750 to $100 and I don't think we will see it our way back. Hunter Keay : Okay. Alright. That's good. Thanks. And then sorry for the modeling question but I think this is relevant. The other revenue is up about 11% in the fourth quarter. How much of that was maybe refinery third party sales and how much of that is just sort of like good run rate core revenue that's going to repeat, not based on the price of oil? Paul Jacobson : Hunter, this is Paul. The third party revenues in the refinery were about $90 million that was equally offset by cost in the other cash cost line. Hunter Keay : So other revenue outlook for 2017? Ballpark? Paul Jacobson : For the full year? Hunter Keay : Yes. If you don't mind? Paul Jacobson : We can get back to you on the modeling questions. Hunter Keay : Okay. Thank you Paul. Thank you Glen. Operator : We will take our next question from David Vernon with Bernstein. David Vernon : Hi. Good morning guys and thanks for taking the question. I guess at a high level, I would like to understand what your thoughts are as far as how quickly you think you can get back to that 17% to 19% margin guidance after this coming year of 100 to 200 basis points of compression? Paul Jacobson : David, it would be premature to speculate on a time frame. We gave you our best view on 2017. It's a year of some transition. Our goal would be, as I said in my opening comments, I think 2018 is going to be a good year, from what we can tell, but it's a long ways away. So we see the trajectory starting to turn back by mid-year and that's important. David Vernon : Well, I guess internally how do you guys think about that long-term target then? Is it a multi-year thing? Is it an ambitious goal? Like how should we be thinking about it from a modeling perspective? Paul Jacobson : It's our long term target and it still is and we are optimistic we will get ourselves there. David Vernon : Okay. And then I guess maybe just as a quick follow-up. As you look at the -- Paul Jacobson : If I could add a point, David. David Vernon : Sure. Paul Jacobson : If you look at our 2016 results, we are right at the low-end of that target range, 16.5%. So it's not some wildly ambitious goal. That's the run rate this business has been on or has been on in terms of building towards it. We had a speed bump RASM, no question about it. And as RASM starts to improve, I think we will continue the trajectory to get better. David Vernon : Okay. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. If you think of that 100 to 200 basis points of compression, how much of that would be just because fuel prices are going up? And how much of that is just that timing issue of getting RASM and cost ex-fuel right? Paul Jacobson : I think there is lot of geography given that this time last year fuel prices were $30 a barrel and today they are $55 a barrel. So it's going to take a couple of quarters and I think that's a sizable amount of that 100 basis point compression we are talking about and that is front loaded to the front half of the year plan and probably by the second half I think we w ill on margin expansion. David Vernon : Excellent. Thanks a lot for the time, guys. Operator : We will take our next question from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Andrew Didora : Hi. Good morning everyone. Glen, just a follow-up on some international commentary. I guess we have been hearing from some other global carriers that both Pacific and Transatlantic may have been holding up a little bit better than some expected given the capacity growth out there. In your prepared remarks, it didn't seem like you are seeing the same thing. Is that a fair assessment? And then from a corporate volume perspective, are you seeing a similar type of corporate uptick on your international routes? Or right now is it mostly domestic based? Thanks. Glen Hauenstein : Andrew, the entities are a bit different. I think we probably would, when all this is said and done, underperformed in the Pacific, because we had the biggest restructuring going on in the Pacific and we did have Yen year-over-year hedged less hedge gains. So that had a lot of pressure on it. The core demand is very strong but it's not keeping pace, as an industry, with all of that capacity. We are optimistic as you get to the summer. When you look at Japan, it's very stable. When you look at China, we think there is going to be stability because we are out of the frequencies. So we think there is a really good opportunity in the back half of this year to start making up some ground on the Pacific. As you know, we have also announced the retirement of our 747-400 fleet, which should be fully out by the end of this year. That should have some impact as we take some of the seats our of the lane sectors that plane was built for different network than we have today. So we are optimistic there as well. So we have a lot of changes in the Pacific and I would expect that when all is said and done that, that would be entity for us versus our competitive set that's most under pressure. In the Atlantic, we have seen strong business demand and strong business yield continue. But again, there is a lot of currency going on in Europe. And when you look evaluate currency, that accounts for a significant portion of the declines we have seen. It's really not a core demand issue. Andrew Didora : And then just like from a corporate volume perspective, are you seeing it coming back internationally as well? Or is it more domestic? Glen Hauenstein : If you think about the nuances of what we have said, we didn't say that core demand for business in the U.S. was suffering in 2016. As a matter of fact, it was relatively real plus. What we saw was essentially a corporate fare war that occurred for various reasons that spread throughout the domestic U.S. network. That did not occur in the international entities. So the rate at which those yields improve or recover from more historical level is much more heavily weighted towards the U.S. Andrew Didora : Fair enough. Thanks a lot. Operator : We will take our next question from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Joseph DeNardi : Yes. Thanks very much. Glen, I was wondering if we could just talk about the SkyMiles program a little bit. At the Investor Day, you guys had a chart that showed total contributions from your Amex relationship and about a $2 billion total increase from 2014 to 2021. My understanding that, of that incremental revenue that's about 100% margin similar to what American Airlines has disclosed. So is it fair to say that by 2021 you will have conservatively $2 billion in EBIT coming strictly from the SkyMiles Amex relationship? Not to box you in at all, Glen, but I feel like that's kind of a yes or no answer. Glen Hauenstein : Or no comment, right? It could be the third option. And I think that's the one we are going to go with here. We don't disclose the core economics of the Delta Amex relationship. So I am going to take box number three and then hand it over to Ed for additional comments. Ed Bastian : Joe, this is Ed. I agree. We are not going to give the future margin on the Amex. But your topline numbers are right that when we did the deal a couple of years ago with Amex that the goal was to double our revenue contribution from Amex. We are right on pace there. And you would be safe to assume there is a very high margin contribution on those revenues. I wouldn't say it's a 100%, but it's a high contribution. Joseph DeNardi : Okay. Would you say that the incremental revenue year-to-year is 100%, that all of that flows down to pretax income? That's simply what American Airlines has disclosed as well. Ed Bastian : I don't know what American Airlines deal is. They sound like they got a good deal. But I will tell you what our deal is. It's a high margin contribution for us. I will leave it at that. Joseph DeNardi : Okay. Ed Bastian : And ultimately those miles have to be redeemed for travel. So I don't know exactly how they are saying 100% of growth. Joseph DeNardi : Sure. Well, that revenue flows through a different bucket, but be that as it may. So I think what that ignores a little bit is the remainder of the revenue, say that $2 billion where you started in 2014, quite a bit of that is also very high margin. So can you tell us, I guess you have answered this, can you tell us what the margin revenue of that stream is? Or could you at least tell us what the marketing revenue from that program is currently? It seems like an enormously profitable part of your business that most investors completely under-appreciate. Our analysis suggests that you guys earned roughly $2 billion in EBIT currently just from SkyMiles. So can you provide us some color around that? Ed Bastian : We are not going to provide the details, Joe. I will disappoint you on that. But what I can tell you though is that it's not all margin. There is a significant cost of fulfillment. We don't give SkyMiles out and not deliver the travel service. So it's a source of revenue. It's far from a 100% flow-through. I would say, on the incremental structure going forward, yes, I think there is much higher margin compliment on the go forward, given that we have already got the base program being served, but no, on the first $2 billion it's a great program, but it's nowhere close to a high margin compliment. Joseph DeNardi : Okay. Thank you. Jill Greer : Dana, we are going to have time for one more question from the analysts. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our final question from Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Darryl Genovesi : Hi guys. Thanks for the time. I guess maybe just to dig in a little bit, Glen, on some of the stuff you said on both the Atlantic and the Pacific. It sounded like you were experiencing some RASM headwinds as a result of the restructuring and then it also sounded like perhaps, so just I guess there's an opportunity there as that restructuring wraps up and some of these new markets start to mature and then also across the Atlantic, it sounded like you said you are going to try to reallocate some capacity into stronger U.S. point-of-sale markets. Between those two, either individually or on a combined basis, is there a significant RASM tailwind to come as these prophecies play out independent of what's happening with the underlying market? Glen Hauenstein : The big question mark, I would say, is currency. If I had one issue that I would be a bit of a cautionary issue is if the dollar continues to appreciate, that would put a little bit more pressure on foreign point-of-sale. But core demand as strong and capacity levels seems to be generally in a better spot this year than they were last year looking forward. So I am cautiously optimistic that absent of another run in the dollar, another significant run in the dollar, that this is, as we have said, in the Pacific, that the fourth quarter would be our low point and that we would move forward from there and that summer in the Transatlantic with heavy point of sale U.S. would be a very good summer. Darryl Genovesi : Okay. And then I guess, if you were to just take your RASM guidance for the first quarter and assuming you come in line with the midpoint of that guidance based on normal seasonality if you just assume that there was no further improvement from there, where do you think you would end up for the year? Glen Hauenstein : We are not going to speculate on a full year RASM guide. That's a good shot, though. But if you look at -- Darryl Genovesi : I was just asking if you were flat, what would that kind of imply? But okay. I get it. And then maybe if I could squeeze one in for -- sorry? Glen Hauenstein : Let me just add one thing though, I think you do have to look at comps and comps get considerably easier as we proceed through the year. So that would infer an improving RASM performance. Darryl Genovesi : Thank you. And then if I could, just a quick one last one in for Paul. Paul, you had commented that asset utilization was down. Is that kind of by design? Or would you anticipate, if we are not in a situation where you are accelerating the SM growth looking out a few quarters or a year, would you expect the longer term CapEx guidance to start to get revised down? Paul Jacobson : Well, good morning Darryl. I think the asset utilization being down is wholly consistent with the plans for the year, as we talked about at Investor Day and the current revenue environment. So I wouldn't take anything more or less out of it than that. And we are where we expect to be on the long term with capacity down a bit. CASM 2% to 3% is still in that long-range strategic view of what we said to be consistently up to with about 2% capacity growth. So we feel good about our cost performance in running the business for margins and doing it the right way. Darryl Genovesi : Great. Thanks a lot and best wishes for a happy birthday. Paul Jacobson : Thank you Darryl. Jill Greer : A great way to wrap up the analyst portion of the phone call. I will now turn it over to our Chief Communications Officer, Ned Walker. Ned Walker : Hi. Thanks Jill. As we begin the media Q&A, I would like to ask everyone that they could have one question and one follow it up with a brief follow-up question. And with that, Dana, could you review the process to get into queue to ask those questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question from Susan Carey. Susan Carey : I ask you about Aeromexico. You say you anticipate closing your equity investment in the second quarter. I am wondering what regulatory approvals are still required? And can you give us some kind of idea about the estimated cost of this investment? Ed Bastian : Hi Susan, it's Ed. Susan Carey : Hi. Ed Bastian : How are you? Susan Carey : Good. Ed Bastian : We are in the process of working through the remedies that are required in order to get the antitrust immunity and we have to have it done sometime the slot divestitures and the JV itself implemented prior to being able close on the deal. So I would say, we are looking at as probably a 60 to 90 day process here to get all the regulatory approvals, the divestitures in place. Relative to cost, I don't have a current, it's going down given the decline in the Peso. It's in the $400 million range, I think. Susan Carey : And the regulatory approvals needed? Ed Bastian : The regulatory approvals are in place. We just need to comply with the requirements. But we are waiting on additional regulatory rules. Susan Carey : Thank you. Peter Carter : Susan, this is Peter. Hi Susan. There is one thing we are waiting for, the Mexican securities authority to approve the transaction. Ed Bastian : That's a tender. Peter Carter : The tender offer. So we are waiting for that approval. Susan Carey : Alright. Thank you. Peter Carter : We do not anticipate any issues with the securities regulator there. Susan Carey : Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Alana Wise with Reuters. Alana Wise : Hi. Good morning everybody. Ed Bastian : Good morning. Alana Wise : So my question is, I am looking at our sheet right now and see that you guys' stock is down about 3% this morning. So I was just wondering if there was any sort of comment on the guidance you guys provided as to why think this might be? Ed Bastian : I could not understand what you were saying. Alana Wise : I can hear you. Ed Bastian : Yes. It is better now. Can you just ask your question again? Alana Wise : Sure. So I am looking and I see that your stock this morning is down about 3%. And I was just hoping for any sort of comment you guys can provide around that? Why it might be? Or any sort of guidance you can give on that? Ed Bastian : So the stock price was up this morning. It's down a little bit. The market is down today. So we don't, I think it's up currently, so we don't comment on the moves hour-by-hour, now. I think our results came generally in line with expectations. So it should have a significant impact on the stock. Alana Wise : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Ted Reed with TheStreet. Ted Reed : Thank you. I have two questions. I guess, first for Glen. You said that basic economy is going to be 40% of domestic markets and I know you are adding a premium product in coach also. So listening to you makes me think that some day there won't be coach plans as we know it or there will be hardly any coach class as we know it because of all these various products. Is that fair? Glen Hauenstein : No Ted. I think actually for the foreseeable future that the main cabin is where a preponderance of our customers sit and that a vast majority of our revenues reside. So the death of the main cabin, I think, is premature to prognosticate on that. But what the offering is in each one of these cabins, think about what United is doing in basic economy, which is very different than what we are doing. We have this all changes as we respond to what consumers really want to buy from airlines is going to be fascinating to watch. Ted Reed : Alright. Thank you. My second is for Ed. It's mainly because I could barely hear you, Ed, when you talk about what you expect from the Trump administration. I understand there is more business travel and there will be more support for you in these cases with the Mid East carriers and Norwegian, but I couldn't hear you. So I would like you to address that. Thank you. Ed Bastian : Sorry that you could not hear me, Ted. I thought I was clear. There is going to be a number of opportunities for us to present our views to the new administration, which we very much look forward to. I mentioned that we are going add more opportunities in infrastructure, given the level of investment we already are making in our airports and facilities and partnering with the government to do even more. That would be a great opportunity. I mentioned the Middle Eastern situation, how we are competing against governments, not airlines in the Middle East. The blatant violation that we see relative to subsidized air services, $50 billion of subsidies over the last 10 years and our opportunity to have the governments move to enforce its trade agreements as compared to victim of it as well as protect U.S. jobs all alongside that. And then the other item that I mentioned is the tax reform that's being discussed. I see Delta certainly being the beneficiary of that, though it's hard to speculate as to the form it will take given it's very early. Ted Reed : Alright. Thank you, Ed. Ned Walker : Okay. Dana. we have time for two more quick questions. I think we have one from The Wall Street Journal coming up again as well as The Philadelphia Inquirer. Operator : Yes, sir. And we will go to Linda Loyd with The Philadelphia Inquirer. Linda Loyd : Thanks for taking my question. You mentioned that the Trainer refinery lost $40 million in the fourth quarter. What's the outlook for the refinery in 2017? And when, if at any time this year, might you expect a profit, the refinery to turn a profit? Paul Jacobson : Hi Linda. Good morning. This is Paul Jacobson. The refinery, we are expecting to produce a profit of around $100 million this year, based on where the current crack spreads and margins look like. We are projecting a slight profit in the first quarter based on where the current environment is. But the refinery continues to perform well against our broad-based strategy, what we look at. We were up there visiting with the refinery employees in December and morale remains high and we remain committed to that investment despite some of the challenges across the industry and the cyclicality. Linda Loyd : Thank you. Thanks very much. Operator : And we have a follow-up question from Susan Carey with The Wall Street Journal. Susan Carey : Thanks fellows. Condolences on this, but I have to ask. On the Fort Lauderdale situation, have we determined that all the injured and deceased were Delta customers? And have we seen any kind of tingling or paperwork filed for lawsuits on this situation? Glen Hauenstein : Susan, it's an active investigation. So we are pretty limited to what we can discuss. It did happen in our terminal. So yes, Delta customers were impacted. But we really can't provide much more than that. Ned Walker : Yes. Susan, I would suggest you talk with the FBI. They have asked to be the coordinator for all information pertaining to the investigation. So I would turn it over to their PIO down in Fort Lauderdale. Susan Carey : Alright guys. Thank you. A - Ned Walker : No. Thanks for the question. Thank you Ed, Glen, Paul and Peter. That wraps up the December 2016 quarter call. We will be back in April for the March 2017 call. Thanks so much everyone. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I am pleased to turn the conference over to Jill Greer. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Jill Greer : Thanks, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us on our March quarter call. Joining us from Atlanta today are our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Paul Jacobson. Our entire leadership team is here in the room for the Q&A session. Ed will open the call and give an overview of Delta\u2019s financial performance; Glen will then address the revenue environment; and Paul will conclude with a review of our cost performance and cash flow. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up. Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta\u2019s SEC filings. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items, unless otherwise noted. We are also providing cost comparisons on a normalized basis as it better matches the retroactive expense we incurred in the fourth quarter of 2016 from our pilot contract to the appropriate quarters of 2016. You can find the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I will turn the call over to Ed. Ed Bastian : Thank you, Jill. Good morning. Appreciate you all joining us this morning. Earlier today, we reported a pre-tax profit of $847 million for the March quarter and earnings per share of $0.77, which compares to consensus of $0.75. We delivered an operating margin of 10.7%, a 23% return on invested capital and returned $350 million to our shareholders. While these results are lower than last year due largely to higher fuel prices, they still represent the second best quarter -- March quarter in Delta\u2019s history. Operationally, we hold ourselves to high standard. We had 64 perfect completion mainline \u2013 perfect mainline completion factor days in the first quarter ahead of last year\u2019s record of 58 days. And prior to April 5, we ran 18 consecutive days without a cancellation. However, last Wednesday, we had a major spring storm in Atlanta, which brought the airport to a full ground stop for most of the day requiring significant diversions. The storm hit our largest hub during spring break, one of the busiest weeks of the season, and it took us several days to fully recover the operation. We canceled approximately 4,000 flights as a result, which we expect will reduce our June quarter pre-tax profit by $125 million. The good news is we are fully back up this week and indeed had another perfect completion factor day yesterday. It is our reliability and great service that have allowed us to improve customer satisfaction levels. Our strong customer satisfaction is why we are able to sustain our 109% revenue premium to the industry, and we never take that customer satisfaction for granted. To our customers, we apologize for the disruption to their schedules. These events always provide fertile ground for learnings and how to minimize these disruptions in the future, and we are actively engaged with our team on making significant improvements to our crew tracking and scheduling processes as well as our customer information systems. I want to thank the Delta people for working through some incredibly tough conditions to take care of our customers and get the operation back on track. You are the very best in our business. Now, as we look ahead to the remainder of the year, the durability we have built in our business is evident in our ability to withstand an event like this storm as well as rising fuel prices and yet remain on track to produce the 2017 forecasted pre-tax profit that is similar to the $6 billion range we made in 2016, which would be our third year in a row at the $6 billion level. And while it took longer to get here than anyone anticipated, we are back to positive unit revenues and expect the revenue recovery to gain momentum as we move forward. This puts us back in the position of generating the top line growth necessary to offset the cost pressures we face and produce margin expansion in our business over the long-term. Nevertheless, we remain committed to keeping our capacity capped at 1% for the year as we believe this will help firm unit revenues and get us through this year on better footing and on the path to achieving our long-term financial goals. Next month marks our 10-year anniversary of the completion of our restructuring and re-listing on the New York Stock Exchange. And as we look back, there are four key pillars that have driven the value we have created and that we are now leveraging to take us into the next decade of success. First, running the best airline in the industry, a safe, reliable, customer-focused operation which is made possible by the very best people in the industry. Next, enhancing our brand by investing in the products and services that customers value that\u2019s what drives our revenue and brand premium with strong customer loyalty creating a more durable top line. Third, becoming a truly global airline on which we made important strides this quarter, successfully completing our tender offer that will result in a 49% ownership stake in Aeromexico, and we expect to formally launch our transborder Mexican JV later this month, and we also signed a Memorandum of Understanding for a Transpacific joint venture with Korean, which has been a great partner of ours in North Asia for more than 20 years. This step will significantly enhance our strategic division across Asia and I believe is a real game-changer. And finally, the steps we have taken to create a durable franchise allows us to invest for the long-term in our employees, in our product, in our balance sheet, and in our owners, because all of our stakeholders have to share in Delta\u2019s success for this model to work. Our fundamental change may be \u201cthe fundamental change\u201d to our business model as we now truly compete on quality and service, not just price. That\u2019s what successful consumer product and service companies do. Executing on these core pillars is what will position us to deliver consistent sustainable results through the business cycle. We look forward to recognizing the 10-year anniversary of our re-listing at the New York Stock Exchange on May 3, and we also look forward to sharing more details on our capital deployment plans for the next few years at our May Investor Day the following week. And with that, I will turn the call over to Glen and Paul to go through more details on the quarter. Glen? Glen Hauenstein : Thanks, Ed and good morning, everyone. I want to start by joining Ed in thanking the Delta people for their efforts over the past week as we recovered from the storm in Atlanta. Your best-in-class service makes the difference to our customers and sets Delta apart in the industry. Turning to the current environment, while the pace of the revenue recovery was a bit slower than what we had originally anticipated, we are continuing to see improvement in revenue trends across our network. Quickly recapping our top line performance, we reported total revenues down 1% on slight declines in passenger and cargo revenues. Our passenger revenue declined $74 million, including $20 million of lower hedge gains. Passenger unit revenues for the quarter came in essentially flat and we were better sequentially each month. In March, system PRASM turned positive marking the first year-over-year improvement since November 2015. The March quarter is the third consecutive quarter we have seen sequential improvement. RASM was 2 points better than the December quarter and 6 points ahead of the September quarter with better results across all regions. We continued to drive value through our loyalty program in the quarter. Flight redemptions were up 10% year-over-year and we realized a $40 million increase in other revenue or 0.5 point not recognized as PRASM. Cargo sales of $160 million were down roughly 1% during the period, which was all currency-related. This is the best cargo result in eight quarters and we saw sequential improvement through the quarter with cargo revenues up 12% year-over-year for the month of March. Looking ahead, we have a good line of sight on positive RASM momentum. For Delta, domestic accounts for roughly two-thirds of our revenue base, so it is critical to get the entity to positive RASM. Over half of our domestic network was positive in the quarter, and in the second quarter we are on track for two-thirds of the entity to reach this milestone. User yields and demand remain very strong as we head into peak summer. Peak business demand also continues to be solid and the outlook remains strong. 84% of our corporate travel partners are projecting their spend will be maintained or increased for the rest of 2017, up 1 point year-over-year. Business fares are moving in the right direction and further improvement in domestic business yields remains our top priority and opportunity. To give some perspective, we saw double-digit declines in average domestic business fares from early \u201815 through last fall. Since then, fares have recovered roughly half of that lost ground, and getting business fares back to the levels achieved in early 2015 would provide significant additional revenue momentum. Our branded fare initiatives performed well with revenues up 10% for the quarter. We expect this growth to accelerate as we add the ability for our customers to buy up to Comfort+ and our first class post-purchase in this quarter. We also completed the expansion of Basic Economy to 100% of the U.S. and Canada and have started rolling out the product in our international entities. Basic Economy is now available in more than 25,000 markets. Overall, our branded fare initiatives are on track to produce over $300 million of incremental revenue this year. Turning to our international performance, Latin [ph] unit revenues improved approximately 4.5% year-over-year on 2% capacity growth marking the third consecutive positive quarter for the region. Brazil momentum continued with RASM up nearly 45% driven by the country\u2019s improving economy, strengthening currency and our partnership with GOL. Monday, we received DOT approval to implement our JV with Aeromexico. We are looking forward to even deeper cooperation and driving incremental value for customers and shareholders through this innovative partnership. Looking to 2Q, advance RASM for the Latin entity shows accelerating momentum as we approach the 1-year anniversary of the entity\u2019s inflection. Between domestic and Latin, we now have 70% of our global systems delivering positive RASM, a very different place than we were at this time last year. In the Pacific, our unit revenues declined 3.9%. Trends are moving in the right direction as well as this region was 5 points better than the December quarter. Alliance is crucial to Delta\u2019s success in the Pacific and we were pleased to announce our plan to implement a joint venture with our long standing partner, Korean Airlines. This arrangement with Korean complements our existing alliance into China with the China Eastern. Both alliances will play a greater role in our Pacific network, while providing premier gateways to key markets in Southeast Asia and China as we would continue to reduce our reliance on our Narita hub. As we move through the year, we should see continued improvement as we down-gauge our fleet and retire the many \u2013 remaining 747s we have in service. These older less efficient aircraft will be replaced with the A350, providing a best-in-class product, along with a lower cost of production. Last week, we won a Crystal Cabin Award for the highly competitive cabin concepts category for the Delta One suite that will be introduced on the A350 later this year recognizing this product for innovation, kudos to the marketing and fleet teams for this great recognition. Our Pacific restructuring has been a multi-year undertaking. We now have the right foundation in place to enhance our profit performance in the region moving forward. Finally, turning to the Transatlantic, RASM fell 0.5 point with roughly 1.5 points of currency impact on a 4 point decline in capacity. We are offsetting some of the pressure from industry capacity and currency with a strategy of leveraging our strong joint venture positions in Europe and growing U.S. point of sale volumes. While we expect that it will take slightly longer to achieve positive RASM in the Transatlantic, this entity continues to drive strong margins and cash flows for our owners. Long-term, our plan to drive improved performance in the Transatlantic starts with more seasonal flying that better aligns our capacity with demand. Next, we will build on an improved cost structure by up-gauging our fleet as we retire our oldest 767 aircraft, which starts this summer and replace them with more efficient A330s. We will also continue to innovate with new products and services like Delta One suites, Comfort+, Premium Select and Basic Economy. And we will take delivery of new aircraft using new seating configurations to ensure we have the right mix of premium and economy seats in these markets. This platform we believe will allow us to compete effectively with the growth of the low cost carriers across the Atlantic. Thinking about the network as a whole, we feel confident that have turned the corner on positive RASM and we will continue to stay conservative with our capacity levels to help firm the unit revenue trends. For the June quarter, our capacity will be flat to up 1% with approximately 2 points of domestic growth and roughly 1.5 point decline in international. Our unit revenues will be up in the 1 to 3 range for the June quarter, which is 0.5 point lower than our expectations were last week before the storms in Atlanta. This will be driven primarily by continued momentum in our domestic unit, which we are expecting to be up between 3% and 4%. We are seeing a good start to the quarter and the month of April may potentially still be positive, including a 2 point to 3 point negative system RASM hit related to the storm impact. And given what we are seeing in this quarter and further out, we feel that we are well positioned to deliver top line growth through positive RASM going forward. We are there in domestic and Latin entities and we have solid plans in place for the Pacific and Transatlantic. And with that, I would like to turn it over to my good friend, Paul. Paul Jacobson : Thanks Glen and good morning everybody. Thank you for joining us today. I would like to start by echoing Ed and Glen and expressing my sincere thanks to the Delta family for all they do for our customers and importantly for each other every day. This culture is the foundation that really makes our business more durable and sustainable into the future. Looking \u2013 turning to our performance, fuel presented us with our greatest challenge in the March quarter as our fuel expense increased by 26% or $325 million from the prior year. Our all-in fuel price of $1.71 per gallon was up almost 30% as crude prices climbed roughly $20 per barrel from the first quarter \u201816 low levels. Our fuel price also includes $0.09 per gallon of losses from our legacy hedge book during the quarter. While increased crack spreads are also contributing to a jet fuel prices, at the same time, they improve our refinery\u2019s property, naturally hedging jet cracks improving one benefit of this investment. The refinery posted a $44 million profit in the quarter as evidence of this, lowering our all-in jet fuel price by $0.05 in the March quarter alone and we continue to expect that the refinery will contribute $100 million for the year and lower fuel prices. Looking to the second quarter, we are forecasting an all-in fuel price in the range of $1.68 to $1.73 per gallon, which is down roughly 13% mainly due to last year\u2019s hedging activity. While we expect fuel prices will begin rising again in the second half as we have seen in the last week or so, the year-on-year increases are expected to be below what we witnessed this quarter. While fuel was the biggest headwind in the first quarter, we also faced some pressures in non-fuel costs, which drove our CASM ex-fuel up 3.6% higher year-on-year. This was driven by the timing of our maintenance spend, various products investments, employee pay increases as well as pressure from lower capacity during the quarter. We were able to successfully offset some of the pressure as we continue to drive productivity through initiatives like our Delta Material Services organization or our surplus part out strategy. Pension savings driven by our excess funding strategy and up-gauging. For example, we produced 1.6% higher domestic ASMs in the March quarter on 0.8% fewer departures and expect to see similar benefits from up-gauging going forward for succeeding years. Our maintenance cost pressures are expected to continue into the June quarter and we will see additional costs as our ground and flight attendant employees will receive a well deserved 6% increase on April 1. These factors are expected to result in non-fuel unit costs up 4% to 6% for the quarter. This includes about 1 point of pressure from last week\u2019s storm related cancellations. But as we move on to the second half of the year, we expect to deliver approximately 2% non-fuel unit costs growth as maintenance spending tails off, we annualize product investments and lap the August technology outage. As a result, we remain on track to keep our full year CASM ex-growth in the 2% to 3% range consistent with our long-term cost target given this year\u2019s lower capacity levels. These cost expectations, when combined with our unit revenue outlook, are expected to result in a June quarter operating margin in the range of 17% to 19%, an increase over 2016\u2019s normalized 16.3% performance. For the back half of the year, while fuel prices are climbing, our CASM increases are moderating and our RASM trajectory is improving. So we continue to expect our margins to expand compared to the prior year on a normalized basis. While we expect that this will result in margins for the full year that are roughly 150 basis points below 2016 levels, all of that contraction will have already take place in the first quarter and we feel that we have good momentum building to continue to drive value for our owners through top line growth, margin expansion and prudent deployment of capital. Turning to the balance sheet, we took advantage of favorable market conditions and our investment grade rating to proactively address our pension obligation this quarter. In a sign of our financial strength and durability for the first time in nearly 20 years, Delta issued unsecured investment grade debt. In the transaction, we issued $2 billion of 3-year and 5-year notes that have blended rate of just under 3.3%, my congratulations to the entire finance and legal teams for a job well done on this transaction. All of these proceeds have been put into the pension plan already. This contribution lowers our pension expense significantly in 2017 and is one of the initiatives we are using to achieve our CASM target this year. While the additional debt drives $70 million in higher annual interest expense in the near-term, the overall transaction will improve our free cash flow as we lower our pension funding from $1.2 billion to $500 million in voluntary contributions for each of the next 3 years. Additionally, this contribution completes all of our required minimum funding through 2024, creating additional cash flow flexibility for the future should we ever need it, although we will continue to focus on voluntary contributions to proactively address the obligation. Our adjusted net debt increased to $8.8 billion this quarter driven by that debt issuance as well as seasonal liquidity. However, we remain committed to achieving our $4 billion debt target which the additional free cash flow will help us achieve. Excluding the accelerated pension funding, we generated $675 million of operating cash flow this quarter. We continue to focus on investing in the business for the future. In the first quarter, CapEx spending was $1.4 billion, which included $620 million for our strategic investment in Aeromexico as we successfully completed our cash tender offer. Core CapEx spending was approximately $800 million primarily driven by investments in aircraft, facility upgrades and technology improvements as we continue to drive towards our new data center. For the June quarter, we currently expect CapEx of approximately $1.2 billion, which includes about $175 million to exercise the derivatives necessary to complete our purchase for a 49% stake in the Grupo Aeromexico. In the March quarter, we also returned $350 million to shareholders paying $149 million in dividends and $200 million in share repurchases. We remain committed to consistently returning capital to our owners and look forward to sharing more details on our capital allocation plan for the next several years, next month at our May Investor Meeting, which will mark our fifth consecutive spring Investor Day. In closing, with solid result we achieved this quarter has us on track to deliver on our commitments with a performance that is consistent with what we outlined at our December Investor Day. Producing a result similar to last year will be another testament to the durability of our business model and we remain focused on driving sustainable performance regardless of the challenges we faced. Jill? Jill Greer : Thanks Paul, Ed and Glen. Jennifer, we could move to the analyst portion of the call if you could give the instructions for the Q&A. Operator : Yes, absolutely. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will hear first from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay. Thanks. Good morning. Paul, on the second half on non-fuel cost gains of 2%, can you help us think through maybe third quarter, fourth quarter, because it feels like you will have a sizable decline in the fourth quarter? Paul Jacobson : Good morning Duane. Thanks for joining us and thanks for your question. Obviously on a non-normalized basis, there is a significant lump in the reported earnings for 4Q because of that retroactive component last year, but as you look at the normalized results in the second half due to both a little bit higher capacity utilization in the peak summer periods and the second half of the year as well as lapping various product investments that we made beginning last year with meal service, enhanced snacks, etcetera, we start to see some of that CASM pressure wean and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving a higher pressure in the first half than the second half. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay. And then on the advanced funding on the pension, can you quantify sort of the magnitude of that cost savings and when that kicks in, does that kick in now or does that kick in sort of on a 2018 basis? Paul Jacobson : No, the savings of the pension were all pre-determined as amortized over all of 2017, so that run rate, which is in excess of $100 million of net savings to the company is already baked into 1Q results and will continue through the rest of the year. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thank you very much. Paul Jacobson : Thank you. Operator : And next, we will hear from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Mr. McKenzie your line is open. Dan McKenzie : Yes. Hi. Thanks. Good morning everybody. Glen, there has been a number of media articles highlighting the move of U.S. banks away from London to other European capitals, Virgin Atlantic is now predicting a loss this year and you have talked about the fleet changes, you plan to make to help get back to positive unit revenues in Atlantic, but I am wondering how you are thinking about solving for London specifically, how much revenue could be at risk and what steps are you contemplating here, if any? Glen Hauenstein : The declines and the reason for the decline and the forecasted profitability of Virgin Atlantic are more related to currency. And as you know, the British economy so far has held up better than anticipated post-Brexit. While we have heard a lot of noise about people moving and we respond to the demand, and I think we have a lot of levers should we actually see that materialize, but given that we haven\u2019t really seen demand declines yet, I think it would be premature for us to announce what we might do if demand declined. And I think what we have seen is, it\u2019s never been a better time to go to the UK or it\u2019s never been a better time to go to Europe for U.S. travelers. And we have seen an offset of UK point of origin, the U.S. point of origin has more than offset the decline in the existing UK weakness. Ed Bastian : Dan, I want to add also that our Transatlantic business to London with Virgin Atlantic is solidly profitable. And you need to remember in the Virgin Atlantic result, there is also other parts of the world they fly to London outside of the Transatlantic and that\u2019s probably the area of core weakness, one of the areas of core weakness that they are experiencing, so we feel very good about our Transatlantic position at London. Dan McKenzie : Yes, that\u2019s perfect. And I do see bookings to London actually are up quite strongly here for the second quarter, and to the UK just in general. And then I guess if I could just follow-up with a second question, I guess again for you Glen, the network investments over the past year \u2013 5 years actually have been pretty impressive and just given the JV arrangements that you guys have been able to ink out here and from where you sit today, are there other investments out there that you believe could be accretive? Glen Hauenstein : Dan, we are not going to speculate on future relationships. The two big ones that we are looking at obviously is the Aeromexico JV that\u2019s going to be launching this quarter. And we are very excited about that. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the Korean JV, which will, in my opinion be a real game changer across North Asia, and we are excited about both. Dan McKenzie : Understood. Okay. Thanks for the time guys. Operator : And we will now hear from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Jamie Baker : Hi, good morning everybody, can you hear me? Ed Bastian : We can Jamie, how are you? Jamie Baker : I am well. Thank you, Ed. The first question to Paul, I am sorry to start with a modeling question, but it\u2019s an important one and I am getting pained by some clients looking for some clarification. When you talk about margin expansion, how exactly are you defining the baseline, is it simply reported margins from last year, in which case, The Street doesn\u2019t seem to embrace your third quarter guide or implications, but it does on the fourth quarter or is your baseline adjusted for the pilots that were out of period or captured entirely in last year\u2019s fourth quarter, I guess the easier way of asking is, what do you consider your second half 2016 operating margin to have been? Paul Jacobson : So we will get back to the specific normalized. I don\u2019t have the margin calculation right in front of me. But we are looking at it on a normalized basis going forward, but for the second half of the year and certainly the full year results factor all of that out, because it\u2019s just a matter of timing. But consistent with what we have said going back to the fourth quarter results as well, the normalization is taking out, I think it\u2019s $390 million \u2013 $380 million out of the fourth quarter and just allocating it evenly across the first three and that\u2019s spread evenly across the full year. Jamie Baker : So your second half adjusted is probably something in the low-16 range then, correct? Paul Jacobson : I think that\u2019s about right. Yes. We will get back to you on the specific, it is the normalized results that we are looking to expand our margins. Jamie Baker : Yes. And again, I apologize for starting up the call with modeling questions like this. Second one for Glen, you mentioned 84% of your corporate accounts expect to spend more on air travel, I am assuming that\u2019s a volume figure as opposed to being a corporations that account for 84% of corporate revenue, first am I correct. And second, for 16% the presumably expect to spend less, any color as to what line of the business they fall into? Glen Hauenstein : The 84% is the survey of our corporate clients and it\u2019s the percent that are expecting to spend more. That is a first \u2013 is 1 point higher than it was last year and it is a first quarter record high. Really not a lot of color around the 16%, they do not but they are scattered around various industries. I think a couple of standouts that are very positive this year would be energy and banking and finance. So I think probably good reasons for both of those to be optimistic about travel for the rest of the year. Jamie Baker : Okay, that\u2019s helpful color. Thank you, gentlemen. I appreciate it. Ed Bastian : Thank you, Jamie. Operator : And we will move on to a question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Michael Linenberg : Yes. Hey, two questions here. I guess first one for Paul, in the March quarter in the non-opt area, that $44 million miscellaneous loss, so presumably the 49% of Virgin is run through their March quarter, what percent of Aeromexico is actually that being run through the March quarter? Paul Jacobson : There is actually none of it going through there at that point, because the tender offer wasn\u2019t completed until the end of the quarter. Michael Linenberg : Okay. So then it\u2019s just the Virgin piece and the next quarter, we will have 49% of both Virgin and Aeromexico in the June quarter, is that the way to...? Paul Jacobson : That\u2019s right, Mike. That\u2019s what we would expect. Michael Linenberg : Perfect. And then just my second question is to Glen, if you are guiding to system \u2013 passenger unit up 1% to 3% Glen and I think you indicated that you anticipate that two-thirds of your domestic markets will be the positive PRASM in the June quarter, so when you think about domestic PRASM, is that going to be \u2013 is the year-over-year gain going to be running better than system average or is it going to actually be below system average, how should we think of it? Glen Hauenstein : I think actually in the text, we gave a figure, we thought that the unit revenues domestically would be higher than that. Michael Linenberg : Okay, very good. Glen Hauenstein : It\u2019s \u2013 expect unit revenues to be up approximately 3 to 4 domestically. Michael Linenberg : Great. Thank you. Glen Hauenstein : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And we will now hear from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Rajeev Lalwani : Thanks for the time. Just a question on the 2Q PRASM guide, what are you assuming on the CASM side as we go through the quarter, are you looking for earlier acceleration from 1Q and then maybe what you are seeing today and in April, excluding all the noise from the storm, obviously? Ed Bastian : Well, Rajeev, we have very positive RASM for the rest of the quarter on the books for domestic in particular. And what we have seen in the past is as we move into the months, because the business fares were lower, those yields declined as you have got to the day of flight. We are seeing that taper off substantially from where we were just a few months ago and we are really just anticipating that the existing trends continue with just slight improvements over the quarter. Rajeev Lalwani : Okay. And another kind of related question, you touched on this a bit on your prepared remarks, but as Basic Economy for yourself is starting to get rolled out through this system and you are seeing others do it, how is that sort of coming into the market, how was it impacting some of the numbers, is it helping, is it not? Ed Bastian : Well, the big advantage we have, I think with Basic Economy is the fact that when people are presented with the option of buying Basic Economy and for these are people who are buying the lowest available fare, when they are actually presented with what\u2019s the content of [Technical Difficulty], they are selecting something else. And that\u2019s the real value, is to be able to define a product and then be able to match that product to what customers want. And that\u2019s really how we have tried to de-commoditize the industry, is to demonstrate the people what the products and services are and separate them out because if we are not able to do that and we are only playing to the lowest common denominator and you wind up being commoditized. And I think when you think back to the frequent flyer program and how we used to give mileage based just on how long you flew and not how much you paid or what products you bought, we would really tried to reinvent the entire airline experience to be based not just on a seat and a fare, but the line of products. Rajeev Lalwani : A quick follow-up there, so u7 are seeing that for yourself, Glen as it\u2019s showing up throughout this system as well in terms of just less fare dilution in terms not pushing it as a commodity as you noted? Ed Bastian : We have been \u2013 as you know, we were the first major carrier to introduced Basic Economy. And other carriers have announced it and now have begun implementation of it. But they haven\u2019t really put it out broadly in application. So I think it\u2019s early for us to be able to communicate what their implementation is going to do to us. Rajeev Lalwani : Very helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : And we will take a question from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi Syth : Hey. Good morning, just on the capacity growth, I know you reiterate overall capacity and I am just wondering if the plan still is similar to what you laid out at Investor Day, which is I think roughly 2% for domestic, flat for Atlantic, down 6% for Pacific and up 1% for LatAm, is that still the thinking on the regional basis? Ed Bastian : Broadly, yes. I mean those are the numbers in total. Savi Syth : Helpful. And then Glen, can I just ask on your comment, with the comment that the international \u2013 kind of the trends in the international segment should continue to improve modestly as you go through the year and I particularly, I am curious about the Transatlantic, because it seems like over the kind of the off-peak periods, there is a lot of good capacity discipline, but with the peak summer coming on, we are going to see high single-digit type growth in the industry, I am just wondering why that wouldn\u2019t maybe make things a little bit worse over the summer period? Glen Hauenstein : I think in the prepared remarks, we said that we thought it would take longer to get to positive RASM in the Transatlantic than it would be other entities. But we are seeing very robust U.S. point of sale demand to Europe for the peak summer. And we are believing that for at least from our perspective that most of that will be absorbed by that higher demand. I can\u2019t speak for other carriers. Savi Syth : Alright. Thank you. Operator : And we will now move on to a question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : Hi, good morning. Thank you. Paul, does your 2Q margin guide factor in an adoption for the new FASB rule and pension accounting or you drop certain expenses below the line and if not, when will you do that and can you quantify the impact for us, please? Paul Jacobson : Sure. Hunter, good morning, it doesn\u2019t reflect any early adoption as we will implement that in the first quarter of \u201818 as required by the adoption. And we will provide more details on that because there is going to be a lot of changes in 2018 obviously with revenue recognition and et cetera. So we will get into more detail on that later in the year. Hunter Keay : Great. Thank you. And then maybe another one for you or really anybody, I guess. But Richard made some comments in the past about some industry over ordering in the wide-body side, I think he referred to it as a bubble, I am wondering if that\u2019s for still the Delta view on that. And as you want to turn that into a broader conversation around where you are stating with the order book on the wide-body replacement side, that would really be helpful too? Thank you. Ed Bastian : Hunter, this is Ed. Yes, we continue to see excess capacity in wide-bodies as we look to the future for the industry as a whole. We continue to look internally as to what that means to Delta and we are in discussion with our OEM partners on what that means. And you could anticipate some reductions, I think broadly over the next several years. Hunter Keay : Any potential comments on what you are thinking about may be issuing some RFPs for replacement needs? Ed Bastian : We will comment on that when we actually issue the RFPs. Hunter Keay : Alright. Thank you very much. Ed Bastian : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And we will now hear from Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Darryl Genovesi : Hi guys. Thanks for the time. Glen, domestic industry capacity is growing about 4% which is greater \u2013 not just the greater than really GDP growth, but greater than nominal GDP growth, yet your domestic unit revenue has seen up 3% to 4%, so can you just comment on the extent to which you think the current \u2013 the current strength and the pricing environment is driven by just clawing back fortuitous discounts from years past that will sort of eventually run its course versus an actual real improvement in the supply demand balance and I guess I would ask that you characterize that by saying whether or not you need to see a reduction in industry capacity growth over the next couple of quarters in order for the trends that you are seeing right now in domestic unit revenue to hold? Thank you. Glen Hauenstein : I will answer the second part of your question first. I think that we are comfortable that with the capacity that\u2019s available in the industry today, we can achieve significant positive revenue momentum through foreseeable future here. And the foreseeable feature for an airline is probably 3 months to 6 months. The first question, could you go back on that because I wasn\u2019t quite understood\u2026 Darryl Genovesi : Yes. I mean I guess I was just asking the same question on a two different ways, so I guess you broadly answered it, but what I had said was, we are seeing about 4% domestic industry capacity growth perhaps much more than that, which actually exceeds nominal U.S. GDP growth and I was just wondering what you thought formula was to get from domestic airline revenue, which is partly is kind of growing in line with U.S. nominal GDP to something that\u2019s essentially twice that this quarter? Glen Hauenstein : I think that when you look at the macros, you could say it grows generally with the GDP. This cycle we have seen really robust leisure demand. So I think what you will see in the industry, this is just a forecast of when you get to third and fourth quarter, you will see that it\u2019s actually probably going a little bit faster than GDP, because the customers are \u2013 the customer base has grown and the fares required to now translate that into RASM are very nominal. Darryl Genovesi : Okay. Thanks for that. And then if I could just ask Ed. Ed, we have had this proposal from Governor Christie yesterday regarding overbooking, do you have any early thoughts on the states or the executive branch, the federal government\u2019s ability to regulate your ability to overbook without a wholesale change of legislation in the U.S. Congress? Ed Bastian : Sure, Daryl. Overbooking is a valid business process. There is operational considerations behind that. It\u2019s not a question, in my opinion, as to whether you overbook, its how you manage an overbook situation. Delta, we have done a very, very good job of managing our overbook as we lead the industry in that regard. And interestingly, when you compare to an airline \u2013 to some airlines out there who actually advertise they don\u2019t overbook. And our numbers are 10x better in terms of involuntary denied booking spend, some of the airlines who advertise that they don\u2019t overbook, but clearly do in terms of having involuntary denials. So it\u2019s not about whether there is overbookings and our aggregate if you think about the full year of 2016, we had in total, 1,200 denied boardings for the entire year, that\u2019s 1 in 100,000 passengers. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a significant challenge for us. I think it\u2019s very much about giving our frontline the tools and the flexibility to empower them at the first point of contact and that\u2019s what we will continue to do. Darryl Genovesi : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : We will take a question from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Joseph DeNardi : Yes. Thank you. So Ed, two questions on loyalty program, 10 years ago, the idea of airlines looking to monetize their loyalty programs was discussed pretty openly, you said when you were CFO that monetizing, it could be an option, Glen made some similar comments, it seems pretty obvious that the market isn\u2019t valuing the programs now, so I m wondering if, Ed you can, if you agree with that assessment and if so, what you guys can try and do to show the market what it\u2019s worth? Ed Bastian : Joe, we have no intent to monetize or spin-off the loyalty programs, if I am understanding your question properly. And I am not quite certain 10 years ago what was the \u2013 what was discussed back then, but we have never given serious consideration to actually spinning off the programs and monetizing them in that manner. I think the issues that have been discussed over last 1 year or 2 years as to providing a bit better color and transparency about the margins in the loyalty arrangement makes some sense and we are looking at that, but we have no intent to go down in a structural path. Joseph DeNardi : Does it make sense for you and the Board to at least look into what the market may be willing to value the program that independently, I mean clearly there would be ways for you to monetize the program without spinning it off, you could sell a small equity stake in it just to show the market what it\u2019s worth, other airlines have done that, does it make sense to at least explore what the value could be, so you can make a more informed decision? Ed Bastian : The loyalty programs in our view are the relationships we have with our most important customers. And we have never seriously considered actually monetizing or outsourcing that relationship. So I think the \u2013 there is value to what you are suggesting in terms of providing some better transparency and value that\u2019s embedded within our loyalty arrangements. But I don\u2019t believe we are going to explore an external infusion of capital into that. Joseph DeNardi : Thank you. Operator : And we will now hear from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company. Conor Cunningham : Hi guys. It\u2019s actually Conor in for Helene, just a little bit more on the Pacific, I know you have seen sequential improvement in your results there and there has been a lot of shipping capacity around that, but maybe you can just give a more defined timeline on when you expect an inflection in that market and maybe just like the mechanisms in which you expect will drive that improvement? Thanks. Ed Bastian : Sure, I think the inflections are the down gauge of the airline from 747-400s to A350s and that occurs late this year or early in \u201818. And the bringing online of \u2013 and this can happen even before the JV. The JV with Korean probably will not occur until 2018. But there are steps that we will take that will bring us closer to Korean between now and then that should improve the connectivity of the Incheon hub. And Incheon is already the premier facility and operation in Asia connecting Southeast Asia to the U.S. And we will take another step forward this \u2013 late this summer when we being on the new terminal in Incheon, which will really be a state-of-the-art and probably the best terminal in the world and something we think very exciting for our customers, it gives us Asia to connect through. Conor Cunningham : Great. Thanks. Actually, all my other questions were asked and answered. Thank you. Jill Greer : Jennifer, we are going to take one more question from the analysts. Operator : Okay, it sounds great. We will hear from Kevin Crissey with Citi. Kevin Crissey : Thank you. Good morning. Can you hear me, right? Ed Bastian : Yes. Kevin Crissey : Alright, great. Thank you. Maybe Glen, can you talk about the 100% \u2013 I think you said 109% of industry RASM, I think there is a view in the marketplace that that\u2019s a temporary phenomenon, at least that\u2019s what I believe your multiples will suggest, can you talk about how you have taken it from, I believe it was in the 90-something percentile, up to the 109, what percentage of that is market share and that might be subject to natural reversal? Ed Bastian : Kevin, this is Ed. We have been averaging in the 106 to 110 range of industry RASM for the last number of years. We continue to see it sustainable. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a temporary phenomenon. I believe it comes back to quality of service and product and delivery by the best people in the industry. It\u2019s not something that customers in the past have had experienced as well in this industry that they are now starting to experience better. And I think it\u2019s durable. I think it\u2019s sticky. We are not seeing any erosion in terms of overall corporate demand. And our share continues to be very strong. So we have heard this probably for about 8 years or 9 years, that Delta\u2019s revenue premium was somewhat at risk and every year we continue to go to market and improve that the Delta people are the best in the business and our customers value and pay us a premium for the services we provide. Kevin Crissey : If I could have one quick follow-up, is there any change in philosophy of used versus new aircraft, there is a view out there that Richard was kind of the proponent for used, I want to see if there is any change in philosophy there? Ed Bastian : The used versus new aircraft are always at the table. They weren\u2019t driven by any one person. Richard was a proponent as many of us were. And we continue to look at the best options for aircraft in the future. And now, listen, we bought a lot of new aircraft under Richard, too, so... Kevin Crissey : Thank you. Jill Greer : We are now going to wrap up the analyst portion of the call and I am happy to turn it over to our Chief Communications Officer, Ned Walker. Ned Walker : Thanks, Jill. Appreciate it. Jennifer, we will go ahead and begin the media Q&A at this point. I would like to ask each of the participants if they could limit themselves to one question and a brief follow-up we should be able to accommodate most questions during the period. And with that, Jennifer, would you please review the process for asking the question, we\u2019ll get going. Operator : Yes, absolutely. [Operator Instructions] And we will go ahead and take our \u2013 apologize one moment we will take our first question from David Koenig with the Associated Press. David Koenig : Hi, this is for Ed, I guess. Wondered if you could address why a 1-day storm became a 5-day problem that had cost you $125 million hit to your pre-tax income? Are you simply understaffed to deal with unusual conditions and what are you going to do to avoid repeat? Ed Bastian : Thanks, David. No, we are not understaffed. The storm that hit us on Wednesday was a \u2013 have the impact that, in my 20 years at the airline, we have never seen. It\u2019s not just a storm there were 7 different thunderstorm cells that happened over a rapid fire basis. Starting early morning to the evening, there were tornadoes in the region. We had a virtual shutdown of Atlanta for the better part of the entire day. And when you couple that with the very heavy period of travel, because we are right in the middle of the spring break travel period to peak, so we had limited capacity and seats by which that we could re-accommodate those disrupted operations. It really created a significant delay in terms of the challenges that we faced. We had crews that were diverted. We had crew rotations that were broken. We certainly understand and recognized the impact that\u2019s had not just on our crews, but also on our customers and we apologize as we did and we certainly take full responsibility for making this better into the future, but it was a function of the environment. As I said in my prepared remarks, we have a team that\u2019s focused on changes that we could need to continue to make in better crew tracking, better crew information and contact availability, we had crews calling in from all across the system that we are literally running the airline hour by hour in terms of where crews were and getting them piece back together. And it was a very difficult process for us. David Koenig : Okay. Anything else that you are looking at or considering? Ed Bastian : Well, as I said, the big changes we are making is around technology investment. And getting better crew tracking and this is an issue that\u2019s not just the Delta issue this is an issue for the industry as to how to minimize disruptions when they occurred. Typically, we certainly have had storms in the past, never in the middle of the summer with lack of warning that we saw. When we have snowstorms or snow events, we typically get out of the way and we let the weather past. We were not able to get out of the way. It hit us as we were right in the middle of one of the busiest travel periods of the year. Ned Walker : Dave, this is Ned. I think also what Ed has asked is go us do a complete deep dive throughout the organization to find out lessons learned across all the different divisions and that process is going on as well. David Koenig : Alright, thank you. Operator : And next we will hear from Michael Sasso with Bloomberg News. Michael Sasso : Yes, good morning. Can you just talk about your comments about wide-bodies? It was a little unclear whether you are talking about the industry itself might review orders that did sound as if you are saying Delta is going to review its wide-body orders. Can you just provide little more clarity on that? Ed Bastian : Both, Michael. I think the industry, when you look at the overall demand environment, internationally obviously since you are talking wide-bodies with the level of capacity there is pressure in the environment. Supply is growing in many international markets in excess of demand. And with the amount of new wide-bodies and a lot of them by the way being triggered from the Middle East is going to create some really significant pressures on pricing in the wide-body market. Michael Sasso : And just one follow-up, can you talk about what happened with regard to crew tracking during the storms? Was it an IT failure? I mean, was there a system that collapsed or was it simply \u2013 it worked properly just kind of got overloaded or something, how did the crew tracking kind of scheduling kind of breakdown? Ed Bastian : It wasn\u2019t a question that the IT didn\u2019t work. It actually worked and it was worked as they designed \u2013 it got overwhelmed by the volume of broken rotations and cancellations and diversions. All of which needed to be put together on the fly at a level, an unprecedented level of volume that overwhelmed the systems a bit. So, the systems are working throughout. It was the size and the magnitude and the volume that we are experiencing that caused the delay. Operator : And we will hear now from Chris Isidore with CNN. Chris Isidore : Hi. Are you concerned about the publicity about the United case and to some extent, the problems you had last week prompting people and Congress to pass a law that would outlaw or severely restrict overbooking? You had said earlier that overbooking was a useful tool, if done properly. Are you worried about this becoming a new regulation or legislation restriction on you? Ed Bastian : I don\u2019t think we need to have additional legislation to try to control how the airlines run their business in this space. As I indicated, it\u2019s a relatively small impact at Delta, while we \u2013 every single involuntary denied boarding, we take seriously and do our very best to minimize it. Our overall total number of involuntary denied boardings in the entire year of 2016 was 1,200 people, which was down 50% from what it had been in the prior year. It\u2019s 5x better than our big major carriers and 10x better than some carriers that actually advertised that they don\u2019t overbook. I think the key is managing it before you get to the boarding process and that\u2019s what our team has done a very effective and efficient job over. There are operational considerations, do wait balancing, weather delay, I mean, there is things that happened that create overbooking situations beyond just pure over sales. Chris Isidore : Right. I guess, what I am saying is are you concerned that there has been talk by some members of Congress already about this and Governor Christie\u2019s remarks were referred to earlier. Are you worried that politicians will react to this story by placing more rules or regulations or are you confident that they will leave things legislatively the way they are? Ed Bastian : All I can do is comment on how Delta handles it. And I am confident when or if people had an opportunity to look at how Delta has managed it, they would say Delta is doing a pretty good job of it. Ned Walker : Okay. We have time for one more question, Jennifer. Operator : Yes. We will take our final question from Edward Russell with Flightglobal. Edward Russell : Hi, thank you for taking my question. I was wondering if you could elaborate on the 767 retirements that you said would begin this year? I mean how many aircraft will be leaving and which aircraft would you plan to pullout? Ed Bastian : We were talking about the 747 retirements and the 767. We are initiating our 767 retirements. Three will be retiring this year. I don\u2019t know the tail numbers are in \u2013 I don\u2019t know that we do. Edward Russell : Are these domestic Transatlantic aircraft? Ed Bastian : These are Transatlantic airplanes. We have retired all of the domestic 767s already. Edward Russell : Got it. Thank you very much. Jill Greer : Okay. Thank you all very much. That concludes the March quarter 2017 call. We\u2019ll be back in 3 months with the June 2017 call. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference call. We do thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Good morning, everyone. And welcome to the Delta Air Lines June Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. My name is [ph] Michelle (00:12), and I will be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, until we conduct a question-and-answer session, following the presentation. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Jill Greer : Thanks, Michelle. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us for our June quarter call. Joining us in Atlanta today are CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Paul Jacobson. Our entire leadership team is here in the room for the Q&A session. Ed will open the call and give an overview of Delta\u2019s financial performance, Glen will then address the revenue environment and Paul will conclude with a review of our cost performance and cash flow. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up. Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta\u2019s SEC filings. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items, unless otherwise noted. We are also providing cost comparisons on a normalized basis as it better matches the retroactive expense we incurred in the fourth quarter 2016 from our pilot contract to the appropriate quarters of 2016. You can find the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ed. Ed Bastian : Thank you, Jill, and good morning. I appreciate everyone joining us on the call this morning. Earlier today, we reported the June quarter pre-tax profit of $1.85 billion and earnings per share of $1.64, largely in line with consensus. This was the best June quarter in Delta\u2019s history. We generated an 18.4% operating margin, a 14% after-tax return on invested capital and returned $750 million to our shareholders. We also grew our topline by 3% this quarter. The first year-on-year increase we have reported in two years. And the quarter could have been even better. We absorbed $125 million pre-tax loss from the operational disruption following severe storm that hit Atlanta in early April. While we can\u2019t control the weather, we can improve our recovery, we had accelerated technology investments and implemented process improvements for the summer that incorporate what we learned from the April event. In true Delta form, our people bounced back to deliver the strong operations we\u2019re known for. For the first half of this year, we\u2019ve had 129 days of no mainline cancels and 35 days without a system-wide cancelation. This is an improvement of 8% and 13%, excuse me, 13%, respectively, to last year and substantially better than our competition. The great work of our people, supported by the continued investment in our business was evident in the results from the recent J.D. Power survey. In that survey, Delta\u2019s customer satisfaction score improved 33 points to the highest level in our history and we narrowed the gap to first place to 7 points. It\u2019s truly an honor to recognize our employees with $338 million accrued in profit sharing this quarter and $70 million in shared rewards. They are the very best in our business. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, our unit revenues are improving and tracking in line with the plan we laid out at our December Investor Day. The same is true for our non-fuel cost. However, fuel prices are lower and this gives us increasing confidence in our ability to drive margin expansion in the back half of the year. And while 2017 has been a financial transition year, as pricing catches up to the rest of the cost growth we\u2019ve seen, our performance is setting up well to achieve the lower end of the long-term targets that we updated in May. Specifically, in each of the next three years, we\u2019re targeting operating margins in the range of 16% to 18%, EPS growth of 15% and $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion of free cash flow. Our financial path forward focuses on four key themes, first, delivering topline and unit revenue growth, we\u2019ll continue to invest in our network, our product and our partnerships for the future. That\u2019s what drives our revenue and Brand Premium, as well as strong customer loyalty to create a durable topline. Glen will spend more time on this in a moment. Second, is maintaining measured and disciplined capacity growth. Strong financially healthy companies grow and we believe keeping our capacity at or below GDP over time is the appropriate level to ensure we can deliver consistent net revenue growth. This should allow us to balance capital investment, supply and demand, and ensure the momentum in the business continues. Third, is driving cost productivity to keep our non-fuel cost growth below 2% over the long-term. This allows the bulk of the benefits of our commercial initiatives to fall to the bottomline, so we can deliver on the margin and cash flow targets. And, finally, being disciplined about our capital allocation, our goal is to invest roughly half of our operating cash flow back into the business, while the other half being put towards achieving our balance sheet goals and targeted returns to our owners. Paul will spend some time on both our cost and capital initiatives. Operating our business with this long-term perspective has proven very beneficial for all of Delta\u2019s stakeholders. It\u2019s allowed us to invest in our employees through wage increases each year since the Delta-Northwest merger, while paying more than $5 billion in profit sharing. For our customers, we have invested $15 billion in capital projects in the last five years, including the replacement of nearly 25% of our total fleet, undertaken significant facility upgrades and enabled investments in new technology. And for our shareholders, we\u2019ve returned over $8 billion since 2013, while reducing our debt by over $10 billion to create an investment grade balance sheet and our stock has recently hit all-time highs with a market cap of over $40 billion. Our work over the last decade has produced a durable foundation. We intend to leverage in order to consistently produce strong and dependable earnings and cash flow growth through the business cycle. I\u2019m incredibly proud of the great work of our 80,000 people that has established Delta as one of the strongest airlines in the global industry and even more excited about the future ahead for our business as we continue to execute on our long-term plans. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Glen and Paul to go through more details on the quarter. Glen Hauenstein : Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. This quarter, we produced a record total revenue of just under $11 billion, an increase of nearly $350 million or 3% over last year, with solid improvements across passenger, cargo and other revenue. This result includes $115 million revenue headwind from the April storm disruption. I want to add my thanks to the Delta people for their focus every day on taking great care of our customers, that is what sets Delta apart from the industry. Our initiatives to give customers a more efficient global network and innovative experience, and more choice through segmentation are driving continued revenue growth, and premiums to the industry, which now stand at 110% through the first half. Before I go through our future opportunities with these initiatives, let me quickly highlight the details of the June quarter. Passenger revenues increased 3% or $260 million, driven by improvements in business yields and our commercial initiatives with $100 million of this increase from Branded Fares. Cargo sales were up 11% in the first year-on-year improvement in 10 quarters, Kudos to the cargo team for delivering this very strong result. Other revenue grew 4% ex-refinery driven by a strong 8% improvement in loyalty, partially offset by lower MRO revenues. Our partnership with American Express produced $70 million of incremental value this quarter and we are on pace to deliver $300 million of incremental value in 2017, including another record year for card acquisitions. This tremendous demand for our co-brand card is a testament to the strength of our brand and great partnership with American Express. Turning to unit revenues, the improvement in passenger revenue equated to a PRASM growth of 2.5%, including 1 point of pressure from the April storms. We saw particular strength in business yields, which improved 3 points versus the March quarter and drove our result to the high-end of our initial guidance. Corporate revenues turned positive in mid-April as volumes increased year-over-year and yields continued to improve sequentially. Our recent survey of travel managers confirms this momentum, with 83% projecting their spend will be maintained or increased for the remainder of 2017, that\u2019s up 2 points from last year\u2019s survey. Our domestic entity saw the greatest benefit from the business yield improvement. Domestic unit revenues increased 3% versus last year, up 4 points sequentially, with two-thirds of the entity now realizing positive unit revenue growth. We expect that to expand to 75% of our domestic network in the third quarter. Our PRASM result combined with a 2% higher capacity produced 4% domestic revenue growth for the quarter. After two years of underperformance, we believe we can keep these revenues growing at or above GDP due to two factors. First, Business Fares, while improving, remain well below historical levels. Second, we expect Branded Fares will deliver an incremental $1 billion in revenue through 2019. With domestic accounting for roughly two-thirds of our revenue base, this type of performance is key to driving further topline revenue growth. Turning to Latin America, we realized positive unit revenue growth of 11%, our fourth consecutive quarter of positive PRASM for the region. Brazil was again the outperformer, with RASM up nearly 15% driven by a stronger real, solid business demand and our partnership with GOL. In the Pacific, our unit revenues declined 2%, a slight improvement over last quarter. Tokyo saw revenue improvements in Haneda and Narita on both load factor and yield versus the quarter, while China RASM declined 2% on a 2-point improvement sequentially. Strong business traffic offset softness in leisure demand driven by industry capacity increases. We are excited to have signed a JV agreement with Korean which provides our customers with an industry leading intra-Asian network and connectivity to over 80 destinations beyond Seoul. And finally, in the Transatlantic, unit revenues declined 2%, including 1.5 points of currency pressure. RASM in the quarter was bolstered by a focus on U.S. point-of-sale, which stood at 70% this quarter, 4 points above last year. We also saw strength in business cabin, which offset pressure on leisure yields from high industry capacity levels. The U.K. was a bright spot achieving a 7% unit revenue growth and we see this strength continuing throughout the summer. To summarize, we are very pleased with a healthy demand environment and progress we\u2019ve made on our commercial strategy. This drove our first positive RASM result since late 2014 and a solid 2.7% improvement in TRASM. And with three consecutive months of positive RASM and that\u2019s actually four, we\u2019re going to hold Ed to his deal and we will no longer be reporting our monthly revenue results. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect PRASM to be up in the 2.5% to 4.5% range. As for capacity, we are forecasting growth of about 2% in the third quarter. That includes a 0.5 point from last year\u2019s technology adage and 1 point from stage length. Seats in the third quarter will be up approximately 1%. As we think about what\u2019s going to drive our commercial performance going forward, I break our initiatives into three broad categories. First, creating a more global and efficient network, making sure we not only have the right overall level of capacity, but also we\u2019re putting the right number of seats in the right aircraft at the places. Our domestic growth is being driven by a multiyear upgauging initiative, which is producing over 70% of our incremental seats this year. In 2017, we will continue to add more A321s and 737-900\u2019s to replace older narrow bodies and take out additional 50 seat regional jets. With larger aircraft, we can offer more Premium product, supporting our revenue strategy, while being more cost efficient. Internationally, we\u2019re focused on reorienting our network around our partners\u2019 hubs. In Latin, we\u2019re moving quickly to implement our JV with Aeromexico, optimizing our schedules to maximize connecting opportunities for customers via hubs in Mexico City and Monterey. In the Pacific, between the Korean joint venture and our strong alliance with China Eastern, we have two partners with leading Asia hubs in Seoul and Shanghai, and soon we\u2019ll be adding a hub in Beijing. The combination of these partners in our wide body fleet initiatives will allow us to reduce our alliance on Tokyo-Narita and enhance our profitability in the Pacific moving forward. In Transatlantic almost 60% of our capacity this quarter was deployed in partner hubs where efficiency and connectivity drive superior margins. We are also focused on increasing seasonal flying to better align capacity with demand and to that end we added five new seasonal routes for this summer and are encouraged by the solid margins we are producing. The second broad group of initiatives is focused on providing an innovative customer experience, making sure that we\u2019re investing in products and services our customers value. This along with industry leading reliability and the best people in the industry is what drives higher net promoter scores and ultimately leads to sustained revenue premiums. On board, we\u2019re investing in reliable high-speed Wi-Fi, upgraded interiors, in-seat entertainment and improve food and snacks. In our terminals, we have multiple projects across our system to bring the airport of the future to our customers today. And we continue to lead the industry on innovative customer solutions like RFID bag checking, biometric self-service bag drop kiosks and biometric boarding passes. We are focused on continuing to make our customers\u2019 flying experience better. Finally, the third category is giving our customers more choice through better segmentation. Branded Fares drove 40% of the improvement in passenger revenues this quarter, as we expand it into more markets, improved our distribution and made products easier to buy. We\u2019re adding more flexibility for customers to upgrade to Comfort+ and first class with both cash and mild options post purchase. We remain in the early stages of marking the value of segmentation and with 200 million customers a year, you only need small improvements in this category to drive material topline revenue growth. When we combine the building blocks we have in place across our network with the unmatched style and service of the 80,000 Delta people worldwide, we are confident we can execute on our commercial initiatives. This will drive value for our customers and our shareholders, not only in the back half of 2017 but into the future. And now I\u2019m happy to turn the call over to Paul. Paul Jacobson : Thanks, Glen, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. To echo Ed and Glen\u2019s comments, let me begin by saying thanks to the Delta people worldwide for the great service they provide to our customers. Their hard work has built a durable business model that is delivering consistent results. For the June quarter, operating expenses increased roughly $65 million, as lower fuel costs due to last year\u2019s hedge settlements, offset investments in our people, our customer experience and our fleet. These investments drove an increase in non-fuel CASM of 5.5%, which included about a point of pressure from the April operational disruption. Moving into the back half of the year, we\u2019ll see CASM headwinds ease despite continued pressures from wage increases and higher depreciation. First, we\u2019ll lap the technology outage which drove about a 0.5 point of CASM in last year\u2019s third quarter. Second, our planned capacity growth for the year was weighted to the back half after keeping capacity flat in the first half of the year, which will benefit CASM. Third, we\u2019ll annualize higher levels of product, maintenance and technology investments from the back half of 2016, such as enhanced snacks and additional meal services that were added last fall. Finally, our upgauging initiatives will deliver benefits at a slightly faster pace as compared to first half of the year due to our aircraft delivery schedule and into service. This initiative is already delivering solid productivity savings and in the first half of the year, we produced 1.6 higher domestic ASMs on 1% fewer departures. As a result of these four factors, we expect unit cost growth in the September quarter to be up roughly 2% on a normalized basis, which puts us on the right trajectory to achieve our full year 2% to 3% non-fuel CASM growth. Looking at fuel, while market prices increased by 10% in the June quarter, Delta\u2019s all-in fuel price declined by 16% as we lapped last year\u2019s early hedge settlements. We realized a $6 million profit from the refinery despite a significant increase in the cost of RIN\u2019s compliance. While fuel prices continue to be volatile, rent prices remain below $50 a barrel and are roughly 15% below the highs of February. For the third quarter, we\u2019re expecting year-over-year market fuel price to be slightly higher than last year, though due to some hedge settlements in the quarter and are currently forecasting our all-in fuel price in the range of $1.55 per gallon to $1.60 per gallon. For the second quarter, we delivered an 18.4% operating margin, up 1 point versus last year\u2019s reported 17.4% margin. We expect margin expansion in the back half of the year as the revenue recovery continues to gain traction, non-fuel cost pressures ease and full prices remain stable. For the September quarter specifically, we expect our operating margin to be in the range of 18% to 20% compared to last year\u2019s normalized 17.6% and reported 19%. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, our strong margins and profit performance resulted in $2.8 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, adjusted for the remaining $500 million in cash from the unsecured debt transaction we contributed to the pension plan in early April. At the end of the quarter, our adjusted net debt was $8.4 billion and our unfunded pension liability was $6.9 billion together a reduction of $1.4 billion versus year end. This is solid progress as we continue to strengthen our balance sheet. We spent $1 billion on capital expenditures this quarter, of which nearly $500 million was related to new aircraft and the remainder for fleet mods, facility upgrades and technology improvements and initiatives. For the September quarter, we again expect capital expenditures of approximately $1 billion, including $175 million to complete the purchase of 49% of Aeromexico. During the June quarter, we generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow and used that to repurchase $600 million of shares and pay $150 million in dividends. We also recently announced a 50% dividend increase, which will begin in the September quarter. This is the fourth consecutive 50% increase to the dividend since we initiated it in 2013 and as yesterday\u2019s closing price represents a 2.2% dividend yield. With this increase, our annualized dividend will be $875 million, which demonstrates our conviction on the durability and sustainability of the Delta business model. In closing, we believe we are on track to deliver topline growth and margin expansion in the back half of the year, while we continue to be prudent with our capital. This will allow us to produce these durable earnings and cash flows, and unlock additional value for our owners. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Jill to begin the Q&A. Jill Greer : Thanks Ed, Glen and Paul. Michelle, we\u2019re ready for Q&A with the analysts if you could give them instructions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Dan McKenzie : Hey. Good morning, everybody. Thanks. I guess, Paul, first question here is, just on the stock buyback in the second quarter and the first quarter. I think you guys have bought back $800 million in shares that the share count was flat, so this is kind of a house cleaning question. I\u2019m just wondering what drove the incremental buyback in the second quarter and if you could just help us understand what the share count is today? Paul Jacobson : Sure. Good morning, Dan. Thanks for joining us. The share count as reported is a weighted average calculation and as we repurchased stock through the quarter, the weighted average was impacted by the fact that we had contributed $350 million of equity to the pension plan at the end of March. So if you\u2019re looking for the benefit of the buyback, if you look to the quarter end shares outstanding, it was actually down about 12 million shares. It was just a nuance with the weighted calculation due to the timing of that contribution. Dan McKenzie : Understood. And then I guess the second follow-up question here for you, Glen. I know that Delta has a number of initiatives in the back half of the year to I think to drive or improve revenue on that particular entity. I\u2019m just wondering if you can just remind us what those initiatives are and how you think they might contribute in the back half of the year relative to the first half? Glen Hauenstein : Sure. Great question. The -- we continue on the path and really it\u2019s not new initiatives. It\u2019s doing the initiatives we\u2019ve already announced in a better way and bringing them to a broader audience, and just within this quarter, for example, we expanded the ability in post purchase, that was in May, to actually buy a ticket and then say if you\u2019re a business customer and you want to sit in a different cabin then you\u2019re allowed to by your company, you can purchase that in a post purchase transaction. We\u2019ve seen about an $80 million uptick for that on an annual run rate basis. Starting this month or this past month in June, we now for elites are allowing them to use their miles to sit in the cabins they want and we believe that will contribute another $50 million to $100 million on a run rate basis as we continue to expand those types of programs. And I think there when you think about that these are new and innovative programs that require a lot of programming, because you have to distribute them through a lot of different means and our ability to continue to focus on bringing the products and services that we have in the market to a broader and broader audience is going to drive our ability to monetize our Premium products more in the next year. Dan McKenzie : Thanks so much. Appreciate it. Operator : And next we\u2019ll move on to Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Ed Bastian : Good morning. Hunter Keay : So you guys sound really, yeah, hi. You sound great. Ed, obviously, you feel like you\u2019re sounding better and better about how things are going. I know that you\u2019ve said that the initial guide for this year on margin was down about 150 basis points, but is it safe to assume that now the 16% to 18% margin target is in play for this year and maybe even step further, might we be looking at, putting aside this whole normalization stuff for a second, might we be looking at year-on-year margin expansion on reported margins from 2016 this year? Ed Bastian : Is your question, Hunter, will we actually expand reported margins \u201817 over \u201816 essentially? Hunter Keay : Yeah. Or if you don\u2019t want to answer that or are you going be in the 16% to 18% range this year, because I know you referred to it as the transition year and you originally you said you\u2019re going to be down, but obviously things are getting better by the day. So I was just trying to sort of categorize how you\u2019re thinking about full year? Ed Bastian : Got it. Yes. We are, I think, I said such in my prepared remarks that we\u2019re anticipating being in the low end of that 16% to 18% this year. Hunter Keay : Oh! Okay. Sorry. I must have missed that. Okay. And then let\u2019s talk for a second the international investment you\u2019re making and how you see these evolving over the next three years to five years. Is this sort of, a big picture question here, is this sort of a view on how you maybe see foreign ownership rules potentially being relaxed by other countries, maybe if you look at the success and stability of U.S. airlines here relative to the rest of the world? There might be some angle where foreign airlines which are far more volatile businesses might be interested in having maybe a majority ownerships from some of the more strong U.S. airline, Delta included. Is this just merely a JV play or is there something bigger picture down the road that you\u2019re thinking about cross border consolidation that you\u2019re setting up for today? Ed Bastian : We\u2019re not angling to get in and control any of our foreign investors or vestees or partnerships. What we\u2019ve got here, Hunter is historically through the JVs and the partnerships they\u2019ve been contractual commercial arrangements and what we have seen is our ability to drive value is much greater once you get inside the boardroom than it is through a pure contract in terms of aligning ownership and driving value in a consistent manner and being able to invest truly for the long-term together. We\u2019ve seen that in Aeromexico, which drove the higher-level investment. We\u2019ve seen that in GOL. We\u2019ve seen that in Virgin Atlantic, certainly. And so I think over time, you might see us continue to go down that path, but no, I don\u2019t think in our future, certainly, not in the next five years to 10 years I don\u2019t see the foreign ownership rules changing dramatically. Hunter Keay : Okay. Thank you. Ed Bastian : Yeah. Sure. Operator : And next we\u2019ll move on to Helane Becker with Cowen and Company. Helane Becker : Thanks, Operator. Hi, team. Thanks for taking the question. Ed, I know that there\u2019s this proposal in Congress to privatize, I guess for lack of a better word or separate out air traffic control and I know Delta in the past has been opposed to it. And I was just kind of wondering if you guys are going to try to be involved in what goes on so that your views are clearly expressed in the process and that what works best for you gets actually implemented? Ed Bastian : Thanks, Helane. Yeah. There\u2019s been a lot of work that\u2019s being done in Washington around the ATC reform topic and, yes, we at the table. We are working constructively with Chairman Shuster. We\u2019re not philosophically opposed to privatization for privatization sake. What we want to do is make certain that we have the proper governance, transparency and cost efficiency to drive the reforms needed in the next air traffic control system that gets modernized and we\u2019re in full support of the President\u2019s agenda to invest and modernize the systems. Helane Becker : Okay. Great. Thank you very much and actually that was my only question. Ed Bastian : Good. Operator : And next we\u2019ll move to Jamie Baker with JP Morgan. Jamie Baker : Hey. Good morning, Delta. Question for, Glen, just a couple of demand-related issues. First on the Atlantic, after the summer peak, how profound a shift is there in point-of-sale? I\u2019m just wondering how the currency impact of that is potentially going to impact the trajectory of Atlantic RASM kind of going forward in the second half? Glen Hauenstein : Jamie, I think I\u2019m pretty enthusiastic about how the first half of the year has shaped up relative to the capacity levels that are in the Transatlantic. And what we\u2019ve seen is really a higher demand in the business cabin on a year-over-year basis and it\u2019s not insignificant, it\u2019s a relatively significant increase. So we read a lot about European business sector picking up and we\u2019re really seeing that in the travel to and from Europe. So we have a couple of things that are developing that are positive for us. The euro is at a multiyear high here. We have business demand and a very, very solid position. As you know, July and August are not very big business months in Europe, so we\u2019ve been able to offset that with higher U.S. point-of-sale. But relatively encouraged at the trends that we see as we go into the fall that those should be quite beneficial, higher euro, higher business demand as you get into more business-oriented months. Jamie Baker : Okay. That helps. And second, in terms of Basic Economy, I\u2019m wondering as your primary competitors rollout similar programs at a pretty rapid pace, has that had any impact on the returns that you\u2019re generating and also has there been any change since last quarter in terms of the, I guess, the percentage of your corporate accounts that all those fares off from employee use. Glen Hauenstein : Well, I\u2019m going let Steve speak to the corporate sector and the other focus we have is not only to ensure that our customers are getting the right seats, but the corporations can sell up into Comfort+ and even first class and I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing a bit, even more success as we move forward and I\u2019ll turn the rest of that answer to Steve. Steve Sear : Yeah. That\u2019s exactly right, Glen. You\u2019re seeing the -- at the individual level the capability to be able to buy into the Comfort+ cabin, which that new functionality is increasing the corporate revenue base. And we\u2019re also seeing more and more corporations from a policy perspective enable their traveler to also purchase those types of products. So you\u2019re seeing it both at the individual level and at the policy level. Jamie Baker : Okay. Terrific. Thanks for the color. Appreciate it. Ed Bastian : Thanks, Jamie. Jamie Baker : Thanks, Ed. Operator : Next we\u2019ll move on to Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hi. Thanks. Maybe I missed it, but did you say what your expectation was for domestic unit revenue growth in the third quarter? Glen Hauenstein : Duane, we don\u2019t typically get that level of forecasting detail. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay. Fair to say that you expect sequential improvement? Glen Hauenstein : Yes. Ed Bastian : Yes. Duane Pfennigwerth : And sorry for a modeling question, but I think there\u2019s a little investor confusion on the normalization of non-fuel CASM. Can you talk about much we should be adding to 3Q cost of last year to normalize and then correspondingly, how much should we be subtracting from 4Q cost of last year to normalized, and is it clear that we should be thinking about 2% growth in the fourth quarter off of that lower cost base? Paul Jacobson : Hey, Duane. It\u2019s Paul. Good morning. What we\u2019ve said is the normalization effect was about $130 million per quarter. So, give or take, so that if you assume that was all out there, you\u2019d be left with about $125 million to $130 million of cost remaining in the fourth quarter. Keep in mind that this doesn\u2019t really impact the second half conversation, overall, we\u2019re just trying to take out some of the volatility between those two quarters, given the discrepancy in the retroactive piece. Duane Pfennigwerth : So that implies CASM down sort of mid singles in fourth quarter. Paul Jacobson : Yeah. No. Jill Greer : No. Paul Jacobson : No, no, no, no. On a reported basis... Duane Pfennigwerth : On an actual. Paul Jacobson : On an actual basis it would be down significantly because of the $475 million charge that we took in the 4Q last year. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thank you. Operator : And next we\u2019ll hear from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Michael Linenberg : Yeah. Hey. Just two questions related to the Pacific here for Glen. So, look unit revenue has been running down in that region, better, obviously in the June quarter than March quarter, so we\u2019re seeing the sequentially improvement. But still on a sizable capacity decline, 10%, 11%, how much of what\u2019s impacting that, is it demand or is it structural or is it, you\u2019re transitioning from the 74s to smaller wide bodies, like at what point do we get to positive territory there, what are you seeing in that market? Glen Hauenstein : That\u2019s a great question. And I\u2019d say that we\u2019re very excited about our 2018 results in the Pacific. This is the last real year of a multiyear transition and thanks to our Pacific team and Ed\u2019s direction, we\u2019ve got what we need in place now with the Korean joint venture to really produce a competitive and an improving Pacific operation over the next couple years. So it was -- when you think about the merger with Northwest, 100% of our capacity was routed through Tokyo and Narita at the time of the merger. And now as you think forward is, we have a very diversified portfolio, we have multiple hubs and we\u2019re really at the endpoints of the restructuring and looking forward to very much improved 2018 in the Pacific. Michael Linenberg : Great. And then, Glen, just you referenced the Beijing hub in your opening remarks, when -- presumably that\u2019s the new airport? Glen Hauenstein : Yeah. Michael Linenberg : When does that come online? Glen Hauenstein : 2019. Michael Linenberg : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : And next we\u2019ll move on to Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Andrew Didora : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just one question for Glen, obviously, 3Q will be four quarters in a row of accelerating PRASM. I know comps do get a lot tougher in 4Q, so maybe that streak could be broken. But is there anything you\u2019re seeing in your bookings or corporate demand right now that would result in PRASM not being positive in 4Q? Glen Hauenstein : Nothing that would indicate that now. Andrew Didora : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And next we\u2019ll move on to Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Darryl Genovesi : Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. Glen, you started selling Premium cabin fares I think for travel in the fall. Based on what you -- based on what you\u2019ve seen so far, does this basically look like your expectation based on your experience with Air France, et cetera? Glen Hauenstein : We\u2019re very excited about that cabin and that cabin will be expanding, and yes, we are -- the fares are where we think they were in the business case and the demand is very strong for the initial. Remember, we really don\u2019t have very many seats available in that category on Delta, of course, we do in Air France and KLM and really, one of the big advantages for all of the programming work that\u2019s gone into being just able to sell that fare is we can better display our partners\u2019 offerings today and be able to offer Comfort+ and Premium Select in most markets now. Darryl Genovesi : Okay. And then you had provided a longer term forecast for Branded Fares at one of your Investor Days. It sounds like you picked up about $100 million or so this quarter or about $400 million on an annual run rate basis. First of all, are those the right numbers? And then secondly, with the rollout of Premium Economy and the adoption of Basic Economy by some of your peers, would you expect that that Branded Fares revenue growth accelerates or decelerates or holds steady from here? Is there just a basic outlook on where that goes? Glen Hauenstein : I think we -- what we\u2019ve said is we believe we\u2019re in the early stages of optimizing that, because when you\u2019re bringing new products and services to market, you have so many things you have to figure out through distribution, through pricing, through customer adoption. And these products are very young in the longer scheme of how airlines have sold tickets and we believe there are multiple years of continued upside opportunity for us that will accelerate at a different rate than base passenger revenues. Darryl Genovesi : Great. Thanks very much. Appreciate the time. Operator : And next we\u2019ll move on to Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi Syth : Hey. Good morning. Glen, maybe a question for you, as you continue to compete on product and you\u2019ve been ahead of your competition on operational reliability and things like that and you\u2019re seeing them starting to catch up, as you continue to improve the product, does at any point Delta\u2019s kind of older fleet start to hinder the competitive advantage or is this going to mix new versus mid-life something that can continue and not something that holds back from a customer appreciation standpoint? Ed Bastian : Savi, hi. This is Ed. It\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s interesting, we -- while we do see the competition improving, which we think is a good thing. We continue to improve as well. So we\u2019re not -- the bar continues to get higher and one of the things that will drive continued improvement in Delta is the investment that we are making in new fleet over the next few years. We\u2019ve replaced 25% of our total fleet over the last five years. We\u2019ll probably replace another 20% to 25% of our fleet in just the next three years coming as we retire the MD88s by 2020 and we start to reduce reliance on some of our older fleet types, 747 is going out this year as well. So I think that is certainly something that we anticipate not just from a reliability perspective, but the financial performance of the new aircraft. We\u2019re bringing in the 321s, the 739s are at or above expectations and they will be a big source of additional margin contribution for us into the future. Savi Syth : Got it. Thanks. That\u2019s helpful, Ed. So, but I\u2019m assuming that sticks to still that you\u2019re going be able to do that volume less than 50% of your free cash -- your operating cash flow, which is around the current level of CapEx, is that right? Ed Bastian : That\u2019s right. Savi Syth : Okay. Great. And then if I might just ask a quick modeling question, is it the refinery -- has there been any change in outlook on the contribution there? Paul Jacobson : Good morning, Savi. It\u2019s Paul. I think that we had said previously that the refinery was expected to be about $100 million for the year. That\u2019s probably down slightly based on the environmental compliance. I think we\u2019ve got about $30 million to-date. I would say it\u2019s probably going to be down slightly from that $100 million but we\u2019re still expecting it to be profitable for the rest of the year. Savi Syth : Okay. All right. Thanks, guys. Operator : And next we\u2019ll move to Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Rajeev Lalwani : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the time. I just I wanted to come back to some of the comments you were making on growth and margins. You\u2019ve obviously done a good job bringing margins to within targeted levels. With that occurring, what\u2019s the approach going to be on capacity relative to the cap that you put in place for \u201817 and beyond, obviously, as we look at the schedules beyond 3Q, it seems like you\u2019re going to maybe move above that 1% level but your thoughts would be great? Ed Bastian : Sure, Rajeev. We\u2019re still operating with the plan we have in place for 2017 which is the overall 1% growth for the year. I know there\u2019s -- out in the schedules there\u2019s a little more capacity in the backend of the year that are going to continue to be refined as we get closer and you\u2019ll see some of that schedule firm up and some reductions take place. But we\u2019re -- the plan is the 1% and that continues to be our goal for the year. And then when we get to the end of the year as we look at where our margins will be and we will anticipate being, as I said earlier, at the low end of the 16% to 18% long-term margin guidance, we\u2019ll evaluate the 2018 capacity schedule. Rajeev Lalwani : Great. Thanks. And then, Glen, a question for you, on the international front there appears to be a bit more stability on the pricing front and your comments going forward to support that as well. Does that maybe change your growth priority to move from domestic to international or is domestic still where the focus will be? Glen Hauenstein : We see more of the opportunities remaining in domestic for the short term and we\u2019ll continue to evaluate the trends. The stability in the international marketplace is other than Latin which has actually been the most stable, is a relatively new phenomenon and so we\u2019re going to monitor that. And as we -- as Ed said, as we look at what we achieve in 2017 that will help guide what we set our objectives to be for 2018. Rajeev Lalwani : Very helpful. Thank you, gentlemen. Operator : And next we\u2019ll move to Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Joseph DeNardi : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Glen, thanks for the color regarding the Amex contribution and the card acquisitions. I guess the question is you guys provide the expectation that Amex is going to contribute $4 billion by 2021. Problem with that chart is no one knows what that means, what to do with it, because it\u2019s quantified as value or contribution. So can you convert that to sort of EBIT number or cash, I think, it\u2019s pretty obvious that that value there is being lost as being currently communicated? Paul Jacobson : Hey, Joe. It\u2019s Paul. I\u2019ll take a shot at that, too. I mean, keep in mind that that -- when we talk about that value, we are talking about it in a cash context. The noise comes about from how frequent flyer miles are recognized through the P&L where there\u2019s a piece that gets to come through now and a piece that has to be deferred over time. That value is split between predominantly revenue from the sale of miles to third parties but also some in the cost side through efficiencies that we\u2019re able to get as a sizable partner. So I think we\u2019ve taken the point and we continue to look at ways to talk about that and disclose that a little bit more clearly in a balanced way, but the value is cash value. Ed Bastian : Hey, Joe. This is Ed. Joseph DeNardi : Okay. Ed Bastian : Joe, if I could try one other thing. Yeah, I think the points you\u2019ve been raising over the last year are good ones and we need to continue to find better ways to communicate the sources of value that we drive, while we have to respect the confidentiality of our agreements with American Express, we can do a better job of laying out some of the value that we are creating and the sustainability of that value. So this coming Investor Day that we\u2019ll have in December, we\u2019re going to do a -- we are going to take a shot at that and hopefully that\u2019ll give us a good opportunity to get the message out a little more clear. Joseph DeNardi : That\u2019s great. So, Paul, just to clarify, that $4 billion, that\u2019s an expectation that Amex is contributing $4 billion in cash by 2021? Paul Jacobson : It\u2019s across all the programs but yes anyway. Joseph DeNardi : Okay. I mean\u2026 Ed Bastian : Hey, Joe. This is Ed. Joseph DeNardi : Sure. Ed Bastian : Just to add, that assumes volume growth, that assumes -- I mean there\u2019s a lot of stuff in there. It\u2019s not a contractual agreement. There\u2019s a lot of assumptions that go into making that up. So assuming we hit our plan and Amex hits their plan and that is what we\u2019re on a good path towards, that would be the end result. Joseph DeNardi : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Paul Jacobson : Yeah. And also just... Joseph DeNardi : Yeah. Paul Jacobson : \u2026 add, Joe, keep in mind too that that\u2019s both on the revenue and the cost line. It\u2019s not all coming through sale. Joseph DeNardi : Okay. Okay. I guess the second question is, the co-brand card market is getting quite a bit more competitive and it feels like over the past few years the strategy at airlines is to effectively devalue the currency. So it require -- you need more miles to buy a ticket, that\u2019s obviously beneficial to the economies of the program for the airline, but it doesn\u2019t make the currency demanded more by consumer. So how do you balance that conflict, Ed, between trying to structure the program to really maximize demand for that currency relative to what it means for the airline? Glen Hauenstein : This is Glen and let me take a stab on that and maybe Ed would like to close if I leave any holes in the answer is, I think, the way that we look at this is the hard acquisitions continued to achieve record results without significant change to the program. And I think there\u2019s been a lot of talk at other carriers who have announced fare increases, but we have been in a dynamic pricing environment now for multiple years. And I think that\u2019s one of the successes of our card in the marketplace is that there are incredible value propositions for customers out there who acquire and use our cards, and we have no intention to degrade the total value proposition. We may adjust on the margin the valuation of peak seats versus off peak seats or particular days versus, but the value we\u2019re creating seems to be greater and greater and I think that\u2019s being recognized on the marketplace by -- really when you would think that the market was probably saturated with airline revenue cards that we have posted three acquisition record years in a row and we\u2019re on track to produce another this year. So consumers are enjoying the products and services that we buy and they\u2019re continuing to apply at record numbers. And our team\u2019s done a great job and we have lots of innovation space coming in that space in the last half of the year. Ed Bastian : And, Joe, this is Ed. The only other thing I\u2019d add to Glen\u2019s remarks are from an Amex perspective, I know we are the leading growth vehicle in their co-brand portfolios by a large margin and the partnership continues to be in a really great place. We issued more free tickets this year than any time in our history and I think the program\u2019s in a really solid position. Joseph DeNardi : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Jill Greer : Michelle, we\u2019re going to have time for one more question from the analysts. Operator : Thank you. Next we\u2019ll hear from David Vernon with Bernstein. David Vernon : Good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the time to fit in the question. I wanted to see if you could comment a little bit about the C Series and how that will implemented in the network, whether it\u2019s going to be put into upgauging existing sort of regional routes or whether you\u2019re also going be putting aircraft into markets that maybe you don\u2019t serve on a direct basis today? Ed Bastian : The answer is a little bit of both. For high demand 76-seat long range RJ markets, we\u2019re going to -- that will probably be the first selection. That will free the two class RJs to replace 50-seat airplanes that are continuing to exit the fleet and then we\u2019ll certainly have a few new markets next year. We don\u2019t have a lot of new airplanes -- net new airplanes coming, but having 100-seat long range jet does open up some new market opportunity that we don\u2019t have today. David Vernon : And as we think about maybe the first rollout of that, should we expecting it to be in more [Indiscernible] controlled airports where you can leverage that that upgauge benefit with at a [inaudible] fares, should we be thinking the newer market will be at the front end of the rollout? Ed Bastian : Well, the first one\u2019s going to go to New York. I won\u2019t tell you where it\u2019s going go, but it\u2019ll start New York. David Vernon : Makes perfect sense. Thanks a lot for the time. Jill Greer : Thanks, Dave. That\u2019s going to conclude the analyst portion of the call and I\u2019m happy to turn the call over to Ned Walker, our Chief Communications Officer. Ned Walker : Hey. Thanks very much, Jill, and good morning. Michelle, would you please review the process that members of the media can use to ask a question? Also, I\u2019d like to ask the media if they could limit themselves to one question and a brief follow up. That should allow us to get in as many questions as possible. Michelle? Operator : Thank. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question we\u2019ll hear from Ted Reed with TheStreet. Ted Reed : \u2026 taking the question. You guys noticed there\u2019s been a lot of controversy over the Qatar Airways CEO\u2019s comments about U.S. flight attendants and U.S. airlines. Do you have any reaction to those comments? Ed Bastian : Ted, is this Ed. I was appalled to hear Akbar\u2019s comments about our people. I\u2019m told he has apologized, but I think that\u2019s locally inadequate. I think it goes -- there\u2019s a consistent theme there that he continues to want to skirt the rules and play by his own rules and I\u2019m glad the employee is not just of Delta, but of all the U.S. carriers spoke with one large voice to say that it\u2019s unacceptable, inappropriate. We have the best flight attendants in the world at Delta and I\u2019m very proud of them. Ted Reed : Okay. Thank you. Second question for Glen briefly, you said that European business yields are up or the leisure yield is being affected by the explosion in low fare carriers to Transatlantic? Glen Hauenstein : That\u2019s what we\u2019ve said in the comments, is that the strength in business demand has offset most of the leisure yield weakness. Ted Reed : All right. Thank you. Operator : And next we\u2019ll move on to Michael Sasso with Bloomberg News. Michael Sasso : Good morning. Can you just -- I heard someone say that there\u2019s, I think, a new policy of allowing Elites to use miles to pick their cabin. Can you just expand on that and is this the first quarter that that\u2019s taking effect? Glen Hauenstein : Yeah. That\u2019s a very exciting new program and as we think about new ways for people to use their miles, we really don\u2019t want them to save them forever. We want them to control their own travel experience and find value in them today as opposed to just storing them away. And so for our highest Elites, we now offer that program. It\u2019s limited to reservations only now, but we\u2019re planning to bring that to the other distribution channels. And when we say continuing to expand all of our products and services to as many distributions networks as possible, I think, that\u2019s indicative of how we see the value that we\u2019re going to create through these products and services expand over the next few years by bringing them to broader and broader audiences, and allowing people to control their own travel experience. And so on a more broad perspective, we\u2019re actually excited about using miles for all ancillary revenues, not just for seat products, but for things like unaccompanied minor fees or pets in cabin and really make that currency come more and more alive to our customer base. Michael Sasso : And one just follow up on unrelated topic, there was a report out of India a week or two ago about Delta being interested in Jet Airways kind of investment, were those reports accurate? Ed Bastian : Mike, this is Ed. We don\u2019t comment on speculation. Operator : And are you ready to move on to our next question? Ed Bastian : We are. Operator : Thank you. And next we\u2019ll hear from Alana Wise with Reuters. Alana Wise : Hi. Good morning, everybody. Thanks so much for taking the question. So I wanted to ask quickly about the Boeing-Bombardier spat that\u2019s going on and I\u2019m curious to know what impact of the decision by the ITC to impose tariffs on the C Series have on your order from Bombardier? And as a follow up, has Boeing\u2019s antidumping petition delayed or had any other impact on potential conversions, sorry, Delta for C Series options to confirm orders? Thank you. Ed Bastian : Well, we can\u2019t comment on the dispute that\u2019s going on between Bombardier and Boeing. We\u2019ll let that play out. But what I can tell you is that we have no -- we do not intend to slow down any of the deliveries that we have planned for the C Series. We\u2019ll be taking our first this coming spring and we look forward to taking that aircraft and beyond that I\u2019ll let -- let\u2019s see how the dispute between those two parties comes together. Alana Wise : Thanks so much. Ned Walker : Okay. Right now we don\u2019t have anybody else in the queue for the moment. We\u2019ll pause a second to see if anybody wants to do a follow up. We\u2019ll pause just for a second. And if not, I want to say thank you, Ed, Glen, Paul, Steve and Jill. That concludes the June Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. We\u2019ll be back in October for the 3Q Earnings Call. Appreciate everybody\u2019s time today and hope everyone has a pleasant day. Thanks so much. Operator : And that will conclude today\u2019s call. We thank you for your participation.",

All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta\u2019s SEC filings. We\u2019ll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items, unless otherwise noted. We\u2019re also providing cost and margin comparisons on a normalized basis as this better matches the retroactive expense we incurred in the fourth quarter 2016 from our pilot contract to the appropriate quarters of 2016. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ed. Ed Bastian : Thank you, Jill. Good morning. I appreciate everyone joining us on the call. Jill reminded me the other day that this is our 50th earnings call that we've done together and it continues to be a good story and we've got a lot more yet to go. This morning, Delta reported a $1.7 billion pretax profit for the September quarter and earnings per share of $1.57 versus consensus of $1.53. While we faced a number of challenges this quarter, including multiple hurricanes and an earthquake in Mexico City, the determination of our people to deliver great service to our customers and communities showed through. And customers are showing us that they value the quality of Delta service. Demand is strong and more people are choosing to fly Delta than ever before. In fact, we had 17 of the top 20 days for passengers carried in our history this summer. We continue to show that air travel is resilient and part of our daily fabric in today's society in good times and in challenging times. This is an important part of our investment thesis and speaks to the health of the Delta brand. We generates 6% topline growth, a 16% operating margin and $1.6 billion of operating cash flow while facing pressure from rising fuel prices and $120 million headwind from Hurricane Irma. We rebounded quickly from Irma and were the first airline to resume service in most of the key airports in Florida including Tampa, Orlando, and Fort Lauderdale. And we never shut down our Atlanta hub operations despite encountering the first tropical depression in the city's recorded history. Our recovery was aided by the process improvements we put in place earlier this year following the April storms including better crew communications and scheduling, very proud of our team. I want to express my sincere thanks to the Delta people for the grace and professionalism you demonstrated to take great care of each other and our customers through all the challenges we faced this quarter. Your efforts resulted in another $314 million towards next year's profit sharing payout. Our profit sharing program sets Delta apart and is a powerful tool uniting all of our employees around a common goal. With this in mind, we recently made the decision to align our profit sharing plans once again. Our people are our greatest asset. And our culture is the foundation of our strategy. This investment will keep our employees holding together for the benefit of all of Delta stakeholders and will generate considerable returns for the years to come. Our unified focus is more important than ever as we build on our revenue momentum and look to counter rising fuel costs and return to earnings growth and margin expansions. Since we last spoke, fuel prices have increased our second half cost by $400 million. We are encouraged by our progress as we've grown unit revenues for the last two quarters and are on track to deliver another positive result in the fourth quarter. We expect Q4 unit revenues to be up 2% to 4 %. We're looking to close this year with an operating margin close to 15% and a mid-teens after tax ROIC. And after having secured our third investment grade rating, 2017 is shaping up to be a pretty successful transition year. Our third year in a row with pretax profits at or approaching $6 billion. As we look ahead with good momentum in the business and a large pipeline of initiatives we have solid visibility to our path to growing earnings and margins. To get there, first, we must keep our unit revenues on a positive trajectory. Through our commercial initiatives and award winning product and service we expect to deliver unit revenue growth and maintain our 109% revenue premium to the industry. A key aspect in the return to positive unit revenue has been the improvement we've seen in the international business. We have invested roughly $2 billion over the last five years to build a franchise with some of the best airline brands around the world, Virgin Atlantic, AeroMexico, GOL, China Eastern and our newest stake a 10% investment in the Air France-KLM group which we closed last week and where we are now one of their largest shareholder. With these partners and our immunized joint ventures we're able to achieve many of the benefits of cross border consolidation driving improved international margins on a sustainable basis. Second, we will keep our capacity at the right levels to maintain that revenue momentum. We'll have more details at Investor Day in December, but right now we expect to maintain a similar domestic growth rate to the past several years, while returning to modest international growth as these entities recover. In fact in Q3, our international RASM growth outpaced domestic. This would put our 2018 system capacity growth in the 2% to 3% range with a full point of this increase due solely to longer stage length. We think this plan will allow Delta to drive both topline and unit revenue growth. And finally we'll stay disciplined with our cost structure and capital. Keeping our cost structure in check provides us the flexibility to effectively deal with competitive challenges. While 2017 has been a transition year on labor costs, 4% nonfuel unit cost growth is unsustainable and we must again return the sub-2% growth starting in 2018. We are in the early innings of a fleet transformation that will drive some of the greatest efficiency gains in our history and importantly we were able to execute on this initiative, while keeping our capital spending at roughly half of our operating cash flow. This allows us to continue strengthening our investment grade balance sheet, while also generating substantial returns for our shareholders. We've built an incredible business at Delta, in our opinion, the best among the global airline industry and as this quarter showed, the Delta people can step up to any challenge and deliver solid results for our customers, our owners and our communities. Now, I'm going to turn the call over to Glen and Paul to go through more details on the quarter. Glen Hauenstein : Thank you, Ed. Passenger demand remains strong and our commercial initiatives are delivering results, which drove a 6% increase in our revenues for the quarter. Great teamwork across our commercial and operations groups limited the revenue impact from the storms, as roughly 20% of our domestic revenue touches Florida and 45% touches the Southeastern United States. I'd like to join Ed in thanking the entire Delta team for their efforts in recovering from those storms. Leisure demand and yields continue to show the positive momentum that we've seen all year along and our opportunity continues to be in improving the business revenue environment. While July business yields were slightly softer than expected, we saw continuous improvement throughout August, September and now into October. That favorable yield trend combined with strong domestic demand drove business revenue up 6% in the quarter. At the same time, we continue to diversify our revenue streams and have seen growth from ancillary resources exceed the growth in base fares. Branded fare initiatives delivered an incremental $160 million in the quarter, the new post purchase option alone added 50 million, contributing to a 30% increase in Comfort+ and first class revenues. Our partnership with American Express produced an additional $90 million of value in the quarter. This growth highlights the value of combining a high quality credit card partner and a premier loyalty program. We're very proud of our SkyMall team, SkyMall is on pace for another record enrolment year and placed first among the US global airlines in the US News & World Rankings of airline loyalty programs. Finally, I'd like to highlight our cargo business, which contributed a second consecutive quarter of double digit growth. This quarter, sales were up 12%. Turning to unit revenues, our $330 million improvement on the passenger line equated to system PRASM growth of 1.9% with positive results in each month of the quarter. Adjusting for one point of impact from the storms, PRASM came in at 3% with our original guidance range given in early July. In our domestic business, we saw unit revenues improve 1.5% this quarter, including over a point of impact from the storms. We continued to gain traction with our business fare initiatives. Of the top 100 domestic business markets, 50% were in positive yield territory at the end of September, a ten point improvement within the quarter. We expect those numbers will continue to improve in the fourth quarter. Coupled with the growth we are seeing in both leisure and business demand, we believe the domestic environment, which accounts for two-thirds of our revenue base, is healthy and moving in the right direction. On the international side, there is good momentum with unit revenues outperforming the domestic entity in the quarter. Trans-Atlantic had its first positive result in three years with PRASM increasing 2.4%. Strong leisure demands on improving yields combined with strengthening business demand and yields throughout the quarter drove this result. We expect unit revenue will continue to accelerate further as we head into the historically high strong business season in the fourth quarter. In Latin, PRASM improved 6% despite hurricanes, the earthquakes in Mexico City and a tougher comp, including the Olympics in Brazil. And in the Pacific, unit revenues declined 3% with a one point headwind from currency and an 8% increase in stage length. Our network restructuring is gaining traction. We are leveraging our partnerships with Korean to move more efficiently, connecting traffic through Seoul instead of Narita, which contributed to positive unit revenues in Tokyo. In addition, our Haneda service continues to mature and generated a positive margin for the quarter. In summary, we now have three of our four entities delivering positive unit revenues, representing roughly 90% of our total capacity. Our focus is on maintaining forward PRASM momentum and we expect fourth quarter system unit revenues to be up 2% to 4%, despite facing our toughest comps of the year. While we benefit from the Jewish holiday shift and lapping last year's election, more importantly there are underlying improvements in the revenue environment. Based on advance bookings, leisure yield, and demand strength continues and we are seeing further improvements in business fares. Indeed our last survey of corporate travel managers showed more than 85% project their spend will be maintained or increased in the fourth quarter and into 2018. This is a 9 point improvement from last year's numbers and the best fourth quarter result since our survey debuted in 2011. It is also consistent with the trend we've seen in our corporate contracted revenues where fares and volumes have recently been in positive territory concurrently for the first time in three years. Internationally, currency will turn into a modest benefit after three years of headwinds, which should also help to maintain our momentum in the transatlantic. In Latin, we have reduced our capacity as leisure demand will be affected until the infrastructure of the region has time to recover. Despite these challenges we expect Latin will continue to realize unit revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Finally, in the Pacific, the A350 will begin flying later this month facilitating the last 747 retirements. This will kick-off a fleet transition that will allow us to meaningfully enhance our profitability in the region over the next several years. Though as we sit here today, we should exit 2017 with all regions in positive RASM territory and more revenue momentum then we have had in the past several years. Then as we look ahead we have three main platforms points we will leverage to continue to grow revenues, earnings and margins. These include delivering network efficiency, driving customer innovation, and improving customer choice. First, we look to drive greater efficiency across our global network. In domestic, we\u2019ll continue up-gauging with new large narrow bodies, leveraging our scale and hub structure to provide more options for customers in a margin accretive way. Internationally, we\u2019ll further build out our joint ventures finding the best ways to route our customers across our combined networks, while making overhead functions like scheduling and distribution more efficient. Second, we'll continue our journey to deliver a more innovative customer experience. We lead the industry on customer solutions like our expanding partnerships with Clear offering video chat with reservations agents and redesigning gate and boarding processes. We are constantly striving to raise the bar on the Delta experience for our customers. And we are seeing results in our net promoter scores which have hit all-time highs. Driving a higher NPS is key to sustaining our revenue premiums to the industry. And finally we are expanding segmentation to give customers more choices. Our branded fare initiatives is about offering customers more products and more markets and making them easier to buy. Basic economy was fully rolled out in the domestic entity at the end of the first quarter and now has been expanded to include more than half of our Latin portfolio. We continue to expect the products to be available worldwide by the end of next year. Our fifth product Premium Select will begin flying in the Pacific this October on the A350 and will be introduced in the transatlantic next spring. Initial sales on this product have been very encouraging and we're looking forward to having it rolled out more broadly next year. Our goal is to have the best in class product offering whether you're a price conscious customer choosing basic economy or a more discerning traveler looking for the luxury of Delta One. Regardless of which product you choose they all come with a great service provided every day by the amazing people of Delta. We're excited about the commercial opportunities we have ahead to give our customers the experiences they value and we look forward to sharing more details with you at Investors Day. And now I'm happy to turn the call over to Paul. Paul Jacobson : Thanks Glenn and let me add my thanks to the Delta family for all of their hard work and the outstanding service they provided for our customers through all of the challenges we faced this quarter. For the September quarter, total operating expenses increased $660 million as fuel prices moved higher and we maintained our measured investments in our people, our product, and our service. Of the increase, about a third of that was driven by fuel. We continue to be focused on doing everything we can commercially and through our ownership of the refinery to drive sustainable competitive advantage in the way we buy fuel. This is even more critical in times like this as fuel prices start to rise. In late July, we saw market jet prices increase significantly which continued through the quarter as the US refinery complex dealt with the impacts of the hurricanes. As Ed mentioned, we now expect our fuel expense to be $400 million higher for the back half of the year than we did just three months ago. We've been able to offset some of that pressure by leveraging the expertise of our fuel team and with the refinery. We estimate that the timing of fuel purchases and the Trainer profitability saved us roughly $60 million in the quarter or about a $0.06 per gallon benefit to our all-in fuel price of a $1.68. Roughly half of that came directly from the refinery and we expect a benefit in the fourth quarter as well, which will drive a full year contribution of over $100 million. For the December quarter, we expect our fuel expense to increase by approximately $250 million with an all-in fuel price of $1.82 to $1.87 per gallon. This includes a $70 million hedge loss and happy to say this will be the last quarter impacted by our legacy hedge book. The remaining operating expense increase came on the non-fuel side and resulted in a non-fuel unit cost increase of 2.6%. Excluding the one-time impact of last year's outage, our 3Q costs were consistent with our first half performance and reflect our continued investments in our people, our product and our fleet. We also saw a modest headwind from hurricane related cancellations and capacity reductions. For the fourth quarter, we expect a similar cost trajectory with non-fuel CASM up 4% to 5% on a normalized basis. This will put us on a trajectory for roughly 4% non-fuel cost growth for the year. There are three main factors that are pushing CASM above our 2% to 3% guidance for 2017 given earlier this year. First, the decision to harmonize the profit sharing plan that Ed discussed earlier. Second, the CASM pressure associated with the storms and hurricanes. And finally, accelerated depreciation from incremental fleet decisions, including moving up narrowbody retirements and the parking and subsequent write-off of two 767s. Combined, these items created over a point of incremental pressure for 2017. While there are reasons for our cost inflation in this transition year, we know we must do better. As Ed stated earlier, 4% CASM growth is not sustainable and we must return to our targeted 2% growth rate. Capacity will play a part. We made a decision to cap capacity at 1% this year to improve revenue performance, but this also put pressure on costs. Returning to a more normalized growth rate next year will further benefit our CASM. We'll have more details on them at Investor Day, but benefits from our fleet transformation, maintenance initiatives and technology investments are solid pipeline to drive the productivity needed to deliver on our cost goals in 2018 and beyond. To give an example, as part of our domestic up-gauging, we've taken 26 new narrow bodies, increasing our average domestic gauge by 2% this year. This is a key part of Glen\u2019s first commercial platform about network efficiency. That higher gauge has produced 2.4% more domestic ASMs on 1% fewer departures year to date. In 2018, we will nearly double the pace at which we're replacing older aircraft with more efficient fleet types and we'll continue to see productivity benefits ramp up. In addition to the network efficiency from higher gauge, the newer technology aircraft will also drive efficiency in fuel and maintenance cost benefits. This productivity and the solid cost foundation that it produces is what will allow us to consistently deliver strong margins and earnings growth into the future. For the third quarter, we delivered a 16.1% operating margin, which was lower than our initial outlook because of higher fuel prices and hurricane Irma. As Ed mentioned, our revenue needs some time to catch up to this latest move in fuel prices and as a result, we're expecting our December quarter margins to be 11% to 13% compared to last year's 14.8% normalized result. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, this is an area where Delta has also differentiated itself from the industry. For the quarter, we generated $1.6 billion of operating cash flow and $470 million of free cash flow after investing 1.1 billion in capital expenditures. This includes $500 million on new aircraft and modifications, nearly $100 million on facility upgrades and $175 million dollars to complete the purchase of our 49% stake in Aerom\u00e9xico. For the December quarter, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion, which includes 450 million for our 10% stake in Air France-KLM that closed last week. Delta\u2019s balanced approach to capital spending continues to benefit our shareholders and we returned approximately $770 million to our owners this quarter. We funded this with a combination of the free cash flow we generated and cash on hand. We have now completed our 2015 $5 billion share repurchase authorization. The third authorization we've completed before its expiration date. For that program we repurchased 110 million shares at an average price of approximately $45. Our repurchases beginning this quarter will be under our new authorization, which is [indiscernible] through 2020. The September dividend payment of $220 million was also the first at $0.305 per share which is another 50% increase from the prior level and represents a 2.5% dividend yield. Since announcing our strategy to consistently return cash to shareholders, we reduced our fully diluted share count by 16%. And a shareholder over that period has received a 422% total return. With our approach to our dividend and our systematic repurchase of our stock, we are creating a tangible cash flow stream that our investors can rely on over the long term. And finally, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, our adjusted net debt was $8.8 billion and our unfunded pension liability was down to $6.8 billion, together a reduction of $1 billion from year end. Our pension has benefited from a $3.5 billion contribution that we made earlier this year in addition to strong asset performance throughout the year. We are pleased that S&P upgraded Delta Two investment grade last month and are proud to join Southwest Airlines as the only other airline to have an investment grade rating at all three agencies. We have made great strides in our efforts to build a strong durable balance sheet and business and are glad that that is being recognized. We're even more excited about the opportunities we have ahead to leverage our foundation for continued success. As Glen highlighted we're in the early innings with our commercial initiatives that should allow us to sustain our revenue trajectory. At the same time the pace at which we are driving cost efficiencies through scale, re-fleeting and technology will be accelerating a combination that is setting us up well for 2018. We look forward to seeing many of you and giving more details on our future plans at Investor Day in December. And with that I'll turn the call back over to Jill to begin the Q&A. Jill Greer : Thanks. Aaron before we go to the Q&A everybody please take a moment. Mark your calendars for our 11th Annual Investor Day which will be December 13 and 14 this year. And as a change of tradition I guess we're taking Investor Day figuratively on the road because literally we are staying home here in Atlanta this year. So we will have more details being send out soon, but do mark your calendars. So Aaron if you could give everybody the instructions on how to get into the queue. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Susan Donofrio with Macquarie Capital. Susan Donofrio : Hello? Jill Greer : Hi, Susan. Susan Donofrio : Just a question on basic economy, you did speak a little bit on the last call just kind of about your expanded ability, you're working on proposed purchase transactions. I'm just wondering how we should think about this as you roll out to international as well now. And I'm also wondering if you\u2019re seeing any changes to how you're approaching it now that your competitors have rolled it out as well. Glen Hauenstein : Susan, hi it\u2019s Glen, how are you today? Susan Donofrio : I'm good, how are you doing? Glen Hauenstein : Doing just good, thank you. We were very happy to innovate in this space and we think it's a place that - as we've spoken before it's more of a defensive product than it is an offensive product because we need to have a product for people who are just price conscious and we want to have the best in class, we believe we do have the best in class basic economy product. And when you combine that with the Delta hospitality, you get really an industry leading product even in that space. Our sell-up continues to remain high and I think that's the key part to that is that people don\u2019t really want the decontented products when they see what exactly it is and essentially it doesn't come with seat assignments and you have to wait till check-in to pick your seats. And a lot of people don't want to do that. Internationally, we have a lot of different carriers who are doing different seat buyback initiatives and we'd like to consolidate that into the branded fare initiative so we can continue to have those kinds of sell-ups not only domestically, but internationally. And really the success of that product isn\u2019t how many people buy it in our mind, but how many people don't buy it and choose another product and that's really where we're focused. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Jamie Baker with J.P. Morgan. Jamie Baker : Glen, sort of a follow-up to Susan's question, on basic economy, does it make sense to potentially place it further up along the fare ladder as time goes on or is that simply a non-starter? I'm not asking about future pricing. I'm just wondering whether it's sensible over time that basic economy potentially creeps further up the fare ladder or is it just destined to remain at the lowest two or three rungs? Glen Hauenstein : I do think that talks to future pricing initiatives, so I'd like to stay away from answering it. Jamie Baker : Fair enough. I\u2019ll redirect to Paul, same question, no, I'm kidding. What's the Plan B if the C Series economics don't work out and what assurance can you give us that your existing contract does afford you an early out in the event that you're forced to pay an egregious tariff? Ed Bastian : Jamie, this is Ed. I\u2019ll take that. The C Series debate or the decision from commerce is not just disappointing, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. We think it's early in the discussions and we also know that is triggering a lot of discussions at political levels, not just within the aerospace field. We will not pay those tariffs and that is very clear. We intend to take the aircraft. I can\u2019t tell you how it\u2019s going to eventually work out. There may be a delay, us taking the aircraft as we work through the issues with Bombardier who is being a great partner in this. We think that the aircraft needs to come to market. We believe it will come to market and we believe Delta will get it at the agreed contractual price. We're not going to be forced to pay tariffs or do any anything of the ilk. So there should not be any concerns on our investors' minds in that regard. Jamie Baker : Can I just redirect to Glen since the first question was a nonstarter. When you think about transatlantic industry capacity over the winter, does your internal model assume any changes in competitor behavior? Obviously, I'm thinking about that negative operating margin that Norwegian posted in the second quarter. I think that that calls into the question that sustainability of that model, do things like that influence how you are modeling competitor capacity or do you just assume status quo with the basis of the -- particularly the transatlantic commentary that you made earlier in the call? Glen Hauenstein : I think the transatlantic has been on the strength of business demand and really that plays to our strong suit, given our concentration in the business centers in Europe. Leisure has been a different story. It's been more about incremental traffic and lower yields and I think that will continue through the fall and winter. And so -- but we do see continued acceleration in business travel. As you know, Europe is coming out of a multi-year recession. US economy is strong and people are traveling for business, which plays to the strength of carrier that\u2019s embracing the business model as opposed to the leisure model. So on the flip side, on competitor capacity, we always talk about who's coming in. We also need to talk about who's exiting and as you well know, we had a carrier in Germany that has now announced it will cease operations on the 28th of October and that was not an insignificant amount of capacity in the transatlantic that\u2019s coming out. So, I think as you point out, some of the models have been more challenged and we'll see where that all winds up in the long run. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Brandon Oglenski with Barclays Capital. Brandon Oglenski : Ed, can you give us a little bit of behind the scenes thought process on improving the profit share plan for all of your employees. I mean I think we understand the intangibles of paying everyone an equal payout here and that could obviously drive some positive influence in the culture, but what are some of the tangible benefits that you hope to get out of this, especially in the context of talking about how 4% increase in unit costs is even sustainable going forward. Glen Hauenstein : We never intended to have two profit sharing plans. We always expected over time that it would be a single plan. For those of you that followed our story in fact we had agreement with the pilots a couple of years ago, the MEC, NATA that wound up not being approved by the pilots that caused the profit sharing to revert back to the original planned rates. So for us profit sharing is a tool that aligns our rewards and recognition making certain our employees are the very best paid, provided we deliver and they deliver the very best performance, which is what they're doing. It's interesting, the question I get as I'm traveling around the system and in the hubs more than anything is what's our profit sharing payout going to be and how can we make it grow. And the answer always is we make it grow by doing better for our customers and growing the bottom line. So it's really a perfect alignment. It gives us not just tangible benefits in terms of seeing that profit grows when or that costs grow only when profits are growing. But that also variablizes more of our cost structure going forward. And it's always been a challenge in this business with a high fixed cost base to try to turn as much of your rate growth into a variable factor and we've done that through profit sharing. So we've got the best margins by far of any of our main network competitors. And I think profit sharing is one of the reasons. Brandon Oglenski : I appreciate that. And Paul can you talk about CapEx heading into 2018, it appears that your aircraft purchase, you're obviously going to ramp up quite a bit. Does that mean you're going to cross your threshold of 50% spending cash from ops? And how do we think about the capital priorities of share buybacks and dividends given the fact - given that it looks like your CapEx is heading higher. Paul Jacobson : We don't anticipate having to make any changes to the core capital allocation strategies and criteria that we used to manage the business which is about half of the cash from operations being reinvested in the business and about 70% of our free cash flow being returned to shareholders. Next year we expect to see higher cash from operations as well from lower pension contributions et cetera, which was part of our strategy that we had articulated earlier this year, Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Glen, on the 4Q guide, can you speak to what regions you expect to see sequential improvement maybe rank strongest to weakest. Glen Hauenstein : Sequential improvement from third quarter I'd say transatlantic we're expecting the strongest followed by domestic followed by Pacific, and then last Latin because of the Caribbean and earthquakes in Mexico and a bit of a tail particularly on the infrastructure in the Caribbean that's going to put some pressure on relatively high yielding markets and on relatively shorter stage lengths too, right so. I think that's how I would rank them. Duane Pfennigwerth : And then just from a regulatory backdrop perspective there's been some chatter that there's a push to reduce burdensome regulations and that the pilot experienced requirements could change, do you guys have a view on how likely that would be to happen. Ed Bastian : Duane, this is Ed, I think that's unlikely. Duane Pfennigwerth : And then maybe just sneak one in, with respect to your JV equity investments. There were some conflicting press reports this quarter about Brazil. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about Brazil going forward and maybe on a longer term basis how investors should think about the annual capital allocated to these international JVs. Thank you. Ed Bastian : Well the Brazil question you're referring to was a misstatement and certainly a misinterpretation at a function Glen was speaking at. We've not announced and nor do we have any plans to make a further investment - equity investment into GOL. Listen, long term Brazil is a very important market, it\u2019s the most important market in Latin America. Would we consider in the future investments, it\u2019s possible, but at this point in time, we have no plans. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : Ed, your stock is not re-rated, relative to other network airlines to start despite the margin premium, the debt pay down and the cash flow. So when you talk about your valuation with the board, is there anything you guys think you can do to drive a Delta specific re-rating of the multiple or do you think it's just a matter of having the entire industry rate before we start to see a turn for your own multiple? Ed Bastian : Thanks, Hunter. Yeah, it's a good question and of course, we do talk a lot about it at the board level. You guys would be probably better judges of that than we and listen, we\u2019re doing very well and we think the margin premium we have versus our main network competitors will be sustainable and we think over time, it will be proven and we will get the re-rating that you're referring to. I think part of the story in the answer on the Delta side is that we need to continue to do a better job of explaining why we're different than our network competitors, the strength of the, the power of the brand and those things that really are driving that premium that will make it sustainable and you'll hear more about them, we\u2019ll talk about that at the Investor Day. But I think we have to distinguish ourselves, not just in the numbers. We can't just look at the math and point everybody to how we comp to the S&P Industrials and say that we deserve it. I think we need to not only prove that, we need to peel the onion back a little more and show why. Hunter Keay : So, if it's an industry saying, would you actually want your competitors to close the margin gap? I mean couldn\u2019t you maybe make the argument that your multiple is kind of capped off until the industry altogether improves? Ed Bastian : We are only focused on our earnings and our margins and we have no influence as to how they perform and I think -- while I enjoy the fact that there is pressure on us to continue improving our results, because the competitors are all targeted at getting to Delta like performance, I have no point of view as to what it means for them to get there or not. Operator : We'll take our next question from Joseph Denardi with Stifel. Joseph Denardi : Just kind of on the back of Hunter\u2019s question. Glen, it seems like one of the main structural advantages that your hubs provide you relative to your peers is the higher percentage of monopoly routes on your regional network. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about how much of a factor that is in your ability to kind of offset some of the lower local fares from the ULCC growth by increasing yields on the connecting traffic? Thank you. Glen Hauenstein : Joseph, we've worked very hard on creating a network that we believe in long term and if you look at our network evolution over the last 10 years, I think you'd see that we've changed probably more than anybody else to get where we wanted to be and where we saw opportunities and those modes that we've created in our network are things that we're going to continue to invest in over the next 5 to 10 years and we don't see ourselves creating new opportunities, but if you think about where we sit in Seattle or where we sit in Boston or where we sit in Raleigh, we think we have a lot more opportunities continuing to over time grow those at a modest pace and we're very excited about the intentional and deliberate places we fly today. Joseph Denardi : Paul, maybe this is a preview of Investor Day, but it seems like next year with the rev-rec changes, you\u2019re going to be shifting a lot of revenue from other into passenger. After that takes place, by far, the biggest component of other will be the profit essentially you recognized from selling miles, is there any thought to renaming that line to tell the market what that revenue stream actually is and you guys -- that revenue line will be about three times cargo and you break out cargo. So why not break out the marketing component? Thank you. Paul Jacobson : We will have more details on revenue recognition at Investor Day, including kind of detailed year-over-year changes and how we're thinking about it. As we've talked about before, we have increased the level of transparency in the 10-Q in terms of how we're breaking those revenues out and we'll have more details at Investor Day. Operator : Next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Rajeev Lalwani : I guess the question for Ed or Glen, just with the underlying cost base moving up a bit from fuel or labor and the margin goal potentially getting a little tougher. How's that playing into your capacity guide for 2018 just relative to the cap figures we saw in \u201817. Ed Bastian : Rajeev, this is Ed. We were very clear in 2017 that we needed to get our RASMs moving in a positive trajectory and we've done that. We said that we would limit our growth to 1% that's what we are doing and the numbers should come out exactly to that for the full year. As we move forward, we need to look at where the opportunities for growth because we can't improve the margins solely on cost, they need to be on the topline as well as cost efficiencies. And that's why we gave you the reference point of 2% to 3% for capacity growth. Domestic will be largely the same on the capacity play, but I think it will continue to generate better marginal returns given the leverage as Paul was talking about on the up gauging and certainly we're going to get a nice benefit on length of fall and where we're going to be flying in terms of fewer departures. But international has been I think a little bit of the surprise story for everyone this year. How international has not just held in, but has rebounded and we're going to take advantage of that working with our partners. So in that context I think the cost pressure that you referred to is a component of why our unit costs are up this year, it's certainly something that we're going to use next year to help reduce, take better advantage of our scale and utilization. But at the same time the capacity itself is market based decisions where we're going to generate the best revenues as compared to just trying to keep our costs in check. Rajeev Lalwani : And then Glen a quick one for you. As far as the demand outlook into the fourth quarter, you talked a little bit about the Caribbean but are you seeing any lingering impacts from events from we saw in Las Vegas and Florida and some other places like Mexico for example. Glen Hauenstein : So each one is probably a different story, I think the most surprising is Vegas because you can see an impact from Vegas throughout this past week and the horrible events that happened out there. And so that was a surprise. And I hope it's not a sad commentary on the human state that we're getting used to this. But from the indications of what we see in terms of demand in Vegas it would indicate that there is not a material decline in traffic to and from Vegas. The Caribbean is a very different story. The infrastructure in a lot of places was damaged or destroyed and that's going to take a little bit longer time. We've taken a lot of capacity out. That's actually why we believe next year we will be flat in terms of Latin capacity with some of the non-affected areas growing marginally and the affected areas shrinking dramatically. And then Mexico City is a bit different. There was an initial drop in US point of origin business demand that tends that seems to be rebounding relatively quickly here. So hope those trends continue as we put more distance and time between the event and the purchase of airline seats. Rajeev Lalwani : And Florida really quick. Glen Hauenstein : Florida, we adjusted capacity to demand, what we anticipated, as you know one of the reasons we were so impacted is we are very large on the west coast of Florida, the largest player in a lot of those markets that got heavily impacted. But that is rebounding with the exception of Key West relatively - very, very quickly. Key West is a bit of a different story again with a lot more infrastructure damage. But not as - it's a significant station for us, it's not a giant station. Operator : We'll take our next question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Katie O'Brien: It's actually Katie O'Brien on from Mike. So one for Glen, could you give us a feel for the tailwind you're expecting from FX in your December quarter PRASM outlook. And then just second on that kind of same point. I know you told Hunter earlier that sequentially domestic would be number two in terms of strength, but overall you\u2019re expecting international PRASM to continue to outpace domestic in the fourth quarter. Glen Hauenstein : I think that will depend on how Latin shakes out. We're in a little bit of a flux situation on what the actual demands are in a lot of the places we serve in Latin America and that will probably be the issue we face. Probably too early to call that, but I think they'd be similar with again Europe leading and the tailwinds are primarily in the euro. As you know, the yen is actually still a headwind and that should shift if current trends continue sometime in December, but primarily the euro. Katie O'Brien: And do you have a number you can put on that or? Paul Jacobson : Yeah. I don't have the exact number, but I think it's about a point, a point of positive unit revenues. Katie O'Brien: And then just one more on impact for the numerous headlines you've been having to face lately, can you speak to the impact if any the recent headlines on Korea have had? Ed Bastian : Korea, it's a little bit of an interesting story and I'll just say because we are now working with the Korean partners so closely or just by the 50% increase in capacity to Korea, our unit revenues are flat to up slightly, which I think is a great outcome. When you peel that onion back a little bit, you do see a small decline in US point of origin business to Korea itself, but being offset by a lot of incremental flow that we're taking today. So really not as big as you might expect. Operator : We\u2019ll take our final analyst question form Helane Becker. Conor Cunningham : Hey, guys. It's actually Conor in for Helane. So Delta has been a little bit less vocal about air traffic control reform than some of the other carriers and the government continues to debate what that might actually look like. From what we know about the current bill, have you guys quantified what that might mean to your cost structure longer term and maybe if you haven't, maybe well, you could just talk about what you expect from the bill on Delta long term? Thanks. Ed Bastian : Conor, this is Ed. No. I don't quite know how I\u2019d quantify the state of the FAA discussions in Washington in terms of the cost structure. We have come out as proponents of air traffic modernization. We have come out proponents of Chairman Shuster\u2019s efforts to do that through a privatized non-profit entity and we're very engaged with all the stakeholders in the discussion and we hope the discussion, while it did not happen in the current session, we think they are going to continue to improve over time that we're going to get the type of regulatory reform needed to make the modernization of our air traffic control systems a reality. Jill Greer : So that\u2019s going to conclude the analyst portion of the call. I am now happy to turn it over to Ned Walker, our Chief Communications Officer. Ned Walker : Hey, thanks very much, Jill. Aaron, we\u2019re ready for the media Q&A now. If you\u2019d please review the process for the media on how to queue up to ask a question that would be appreciated. And for the media, if you could limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up, that should allow us to accommodate almost everyone who wants to ask a question. Aaron, please go ahead. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Doug Cameron with Wall Street Journal. Doug Cameron : Ed, quick question. You were pretty adamant that you don't expect, can you hear me by the way? Ed Bastian : I can, Doug. Good to talk to you. Doug Cameron : Excellent. Okay. Yeah. You're pretty adamant you don't expect to pay any tariffs on the C Series, is that because you believe that we\u2019re finding a form and hence tariffs won\u2019t play a part or that you're prepared to go down in some of the appeals process, I'm just trying to, I don't want to interpret your words, but rather you expand it. Ed Bastian : I think my words are very clear, no, we will not pay the tariffs that are being discussed or debated. First of all, those tariffs are preliminary as I mentioned. In our opinion, it is very difficult for Boeing or any US manufacturer to claim arm with a product that we purchased that they did not offer and they don't produce. In fact, they ended the production of the 717, which would be the closest akin 10 years ago. When we went through the RFP to select and selected the C Series, Boeing competed very hard for the order, except they were competing with not their own product, but it was a Brazilian product, an Embraer product. That wasn\u2019t even new, it was used, E190s ironically from all places over at Canada. So as you looked through this and tried to see how exactly a harm case is going to be developed, particularly to justify the type of terrorists that are being contemplated. To us it's unrealistic, a bit nonsensical. But we're working closely with our partners at Bombardier\u2026 Doug Cameron : Sorry to interrupt, Ed, but what happens if they do impose [indiscernible] I mean it\u2019s out of your hands, you can make your case, but what happens if they do find harm and impose the tariffs. Ed Bastian : Well, there's various other plans that we're also contemplating and looking at alternatives which I will not get into with you. But I continue to believe there's not a case to be made specific to the Delta order that there was any harm brought to the Boeing company. Doug Cameron : But whatever happens you will take the planes? Ed Bastian : I didn't say that. I said we will not pay any tariffs. Doug Cameron : You said earlier in response to the analysts question that you'll take the plane. Ed Bastian : And yes, we will take the planes. I said there may be a delay in taking them as this debate gets - brought to a head over the course of the next 12 months. But no, we do not expect to take - pay any tariffs and we do expect to take the planes. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Michael Sasso with Bloomberg News. Michael Sasso : Just kind of following up on the Bombardier issue again, I think one of the analysts asked something about if - what the contract with Bombardier says about ability to get out of the contract, I don't recall hearing a response. Ed, can you just talk, is there - what is the contract say about ability to get out of the contract if all things go wrong? Ed Bastian : Michael, we would never tell you what's in our contract because it's a private contract and we're not going to disclose the elements of the contract. But I hopefully was very, very clear that we are not going to pay a tariff and we do expect to still take the aeroplane. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Aaron Karp with Air Transport World. Aaron Karp : You talked about CASM being unsustainable, what can you do to change that and is labor you think the main reason that it grew so much this year. Ed Bastian : Yes Aaron, this is Ed. I'd say of the 4% overall non-fuel cost growth that we've seen this year about half of it is due to labor. The snap-ups, the increased wages to get all of our employees at the right levels on the industry pay scale. And I'd say the other half, some of that\u2019s due to the fact that our utilization of the airline was down as we were limiting our growth to 1% which caused a hit on our fixed cost structure, which at next year as we look to grow modestly above that we will be able to recapture. And there's also some - there were some depreciation from some charges some aircraft that we are early retiring as we\u2019re continuing to accelerate our fleet transformation. Unlike some of our peers, we don't special out cost charges. We stopped that years ago. Others would probably take those cost and was special and they not include them, we count everything at Delta. And that was a little bit of the cost pressure that we're seeing as well. Aaron Karp : And are you confident that say two years from now there won't be another labor cost increase, do you think this was a one adjustment or are more - is labor going to continually get increases as Delta continues to do so well. Ed Bastian : It's hard for me to predict what the future is going to be. But if airline earnings continue to grow and margins expand, there's no question labor will get higher earnings, which is perfectly normal and natural. But I think you're asking a speculative question, it would be pretty hard to answer right now. Ed Bastian : Okay Aaron, we have time for one more question. Operator : All right. We will take our final question from Kelly Yamanouchi with Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Kelly Yamanouchi : I\u2019m wondering if you have any breakdown within the Hurricane Irma revenue impact on the impact of fare caps, is that significant in anyway? Ed Bastian : The impact of the fare cap? Kelly Yamanouchi : Yes. Ed Bastian : That wasn\u2019t really a big part of the cost, Kelly. The major part of the costs were the prices that got canceled. Kelly Yamanouchi : And I was also wondering, as a follow-up, what you think about Durbin\u2019s comments on [Technical Difficulty] further adjust air fares in the wake of hurricanes to allow more people to relocate? Ed Bastian : Kelly, I couldn\u2019t quite -- you broke up during your question. Can you repeat that? Kelly Yamanouchi : Oh, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m wondering what you think if you have a perspective on Durbin\u2019s comments on when the airlines to further adjust air fares in the wake of hurricanes to provide more weekends for example to relocate to the mainland. Ed Bastian : Okay. So again maybe it\u2019s about your Senator Durbin's comments about restricting air fares. Listen, we didn\u2019t make that decision based on any input at all from Washington, it was the right thing to do for our customers. We added about 12,000 seats in the last few days at very, very low fare levels to bring 10,000, 12,000 people out of South Florida and San Juan in the islands at the -- with equipment that ordinarily doesn\u2019t imply to Florida, whatever we could get our hands on to get people out of there. I think we did an amazing job with respect to the overall recovery efforts; very, very proud of our team. We also have contributed over $2 million to the Red Cross and our care fund and other channels to participate in the recovery effort and across the board, the response from all of the communities in whether San Juan, the Iowans, Florida have been resoundingly positive towards the leadership Delta took in the efforts. We\u2019re the very last airline flying into just about every station of South Florida, giving people the opportunities to get out. All at capped fare levels and we were the very first back giving people the opportunity to get back in. So it was a shining moment for Delta, it really was. Peter Carter : And Kelly, I would say that, this is Peter Carter, members of Congress from the states impacted have reached out and thanked Delta for everything it did in Ida hurricane. Ned Walker : Okay. Hey, thank you, Ed, Glen, Paul and Peter. That concludes the September quarter 2017 earnings call. We'll talk again when we announce year-end results in January. Good bye everybody and thanks so much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Good morning, everyone. And welcome to the Delta Air Lines December Quarter and Full Year Financial Results Conference. My name is Ebony, and I will be your coordinator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Jill Greer : Thanks, Ebony. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our December quarter and full year earnings call. Joining us from Atlanta today are CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Paul Jacobson. Our entire leadership team is here in the room for the Q&A session. Ed will open the call and give an overview of Delta\u2019s financial performance, Glen will then address the revenue environment and Paul will conclude with a review of our cost performance and cash flow. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up. Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta\u2019s SEC filings. We\u2019ll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items, unless noted otherwise. We\u2019re also providing cost comparisons on a normalized basis as this better matches the retroactive expense we incurred in the fourth quarter 2016 from our pilot contract to the appropriate quarters of 2016. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the IR page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ed. Ed Bastian : Well, thanks, Jill. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining the call this morning. Earlier today Delta reported December quarter and full year results, including a December quarter pre-tax profit of $1 billion and an EPS of $0.96 ahead of consensus, which sat at $0.88. These rounds out the year with a $5.5 billion pre-tax profit and a 14.4% operating margin. Operationally, the month of December presented us with several unique challenges, a significant southeastern snowstorm and the Atlanta Airport power outage. Together these events drove a $60 million impact and roughly 2,900 cancellations. And thus far in January, our teams have persevered through the storm that hit the east coast earlier in the month and water main break at JFK this past weekend. I want to thank the Delta people for their incredible work in taking care of our customers, while recovering from these difficult events. Once again, they demonstrated that our people and our culture are Delta\u2019s strongest competitive advantage. But it also reflects the importance of the significant airport infrastructure investments that we are a making to enhance the tools available to our employees to improve our customers\u2019 experience. For their outstanding work, we are pleased to recognize the Delta team with over $1 billion in profit sharing this year, which will be the fourth consecutive year of paying the $1 billion. With our culture at the foundation, we are focused on the ways to improve our operational performance. We are running the best operation in the industry and ended 2017 with 242 days of no mainline cancellations, including a 50-day streak, 5-0, without a single mainline cancellation, while keeping domestic mainline on time arrivals at 85.4%. We also had 90 days in 2017 with no system cancellations on the entire Delta platform or brand perfect days as we call them over 10% more than last year. The extraordinary work by our entire operations team resulted in Delta being named 2017\u2019s Most On-Time Global Airline by FlightGlobal. The first time a U.S. airline has earned this distinction. And in today\u2019s paper, we are pleased to see Delta named as the top airline of 2017 as determined by a thorough analysis conducted by the Wall Street Journal. Running a great operation not only drives customer satisfaction but also cost efficiency. Our operating performance combined with the investments we\u2019ve made in our people, our fleet, products and facilities have driven a 2-point improvement in our net promoter score this year, including reaching an all-time high of 46.9% for the month of November. So while 2017 certainly had its challenges, it was a very successful year. Customer and employee satisfaction remains strong, and we produced solid financial results, enabling significant investment in Delta\u2019s future. And as we laid out at Investor Day last month, we are entering 2018 with solid momentum. However, we are mindful of rising jet fuel prices. Our fuel expense rose by nearly $350 million in the December quarter and current market jet fuel prices are 30% higher than last year. While higher fuel prices helped create greater stability for the industry over the long run, in the short-term it does take time for our business to recalibrate and recover those costs through our revenues. But, with a solid demand environment and economic backdrop combined with the flexibility that we\u2019ve built into our business, we feel well-positioned to address this higher fuel environment. Glen and Paul will take you through the details, but I\u2019d like to spend a couple minutes on our path to strengthen our company and grow earnings in 2018. First, we have to keep our topline growing. We\u2019re targeting a 4% to 6% revenue increase, while maintaining prudent 2% to 3% system capacity growth. We are currently seeing the best revenue momentum we had in five years and the December quarter was the first time all entities were positive since early 2013. We are gaining ground with our commercial initiatives and demand remains very strong. In fact, we set a new number one system and domestic revenue record on the Sunday after Thanksgiving. Second, we\u2019ll leverage our international opportunities by our own growth, as well as through our partner relationships. After several years of shrinking our international capacity in response to economic weakness and the strong dollar, we\u2019re in good position to benefit from the improved global outlook. Our portfolio of investments is essentially complete and we have built a $2 billion asset that includes some of the leading airline brands around the globe. We\u2019ll drive enhanced value over the coming years through deeper integration of the Air France-KLM and Virgin Atlantic joint ventures, and we will be building out our JVs with Aeromexico, Korean, and WestJet. Third, we must change the trajectory on unit costs and deliver on our zero to 2% non-fuel CASM growth guide for the year. It is the top priority for our finance team. Our decisions to invest in the business and restrain capacity in 2017 were the right ones, but they also contributed to unit cost growing over 4% for the year. This is not sustainable. With 60 new aircraft to be delivered this year, our up-gauging strategy is set to produce some of the greatest efficiency gains in Delta\u2019s history and will play a key role in returning our cost to a better level. And finally, we are focused on making technology an improving source of competitive advantage. We are in the midst of a significant digital transformation, which will enhance our customer interactions and deliver more personalized service, further strengthening our brand and revenue premium. With a pipeline of initiatives that we laid out at Investor Day supporting these themes, we have a path to grow earnings this year and now expect to produce $6.35 per share to $6.70 per share in 2018, an improvement from our earlier guidance based on the additional benefits from tax reform. And as we think about the business long-term, we will continue to build upon and leverage our key economic moats, those competitive differentiators that will ensure our future success, our culture, our industry leading operational reliability, our unrivaled domestic network, our customer loyalty and brand, and our investment grade balance sheet. Put together, these are Delta\u2019s unique advantages that provide the foundation to not only sustain our performance, but also improve upon our results. It\u2019s a powerful combination. It\u2019s why I have confidence and optimism for the year ahead. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Glen. Glen Hauenstein : Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. With the momentum we\u2019ve built throughout 2017, we are starting 2018 with a better revenue backdrop than we\u2019ve seen in many years. Revenues in the quarter increased 8% driven by modest capacity growth, broad-based revenue improvement and strong ancillary contribution. These results included a $45 million impact from Winter Storm Benji and the Atlanta power outage. My thanks go out to the entire team for everything they have done this year to take incredible care of our customers, especially during the operational challenges it\u2019s truly our people who make the difference. For the quarter, passenger revenues increased $527 million or 7% driven by strong demand and improving business yields. Our investments aimed at corporate travelers continued to gain traction as Delta was named Best Airline in the Business Travel News survey for an unprecedented seventh consecutive year. Our fourth quarter corporate revenue growth was our highest since 2014, with both passenger volume and average fare improvements. Going forward, we expect corporate momentum to continue. Our last survey of corporate travel managers showed more than 88% project their spend will be maintained or increased in 2018. This is a 3-point improvement from last year\u2019s numbers and is the most positive outlook we\u2019ve seen in three years. We also have continued strength in cargo and other revenues with cargo contributing a third consecutive quarter of double-digit improvement, up 14% in the December quarter. This caps off our first year of increases in the cargo revenue in six years. Our partnership with American Express produced an incremental $19 million of value in the quarter. In 2017 we enrolled over 1 million new SkyMiles credit card accounts, a record for annual enrollment. Co-brand spend was up 12% versus the prior year, outpacing the industry growth as reported through the third quarter. We expect another solid year of growth with an incremental 300 million from our American Express agreement in 2018. Turning to unit revenues, 4Q system PRASM was up 4.2% with all entities closing the year in positive territory as we saw underlying improvements throughout the quarter. These results include about a 0.5 point from a one-time revenue adjustment. The domestic entity delivered its third consecutive quarter of positive year-over-year PRASM with solid demand for both business and leisure, and for the quarter all hubs produced positive unit revenue results. We continued to see improvements in business markets with now 81 of the top 100 business markets in positive yield territory up from 50% at the end of 3Q. Our domestic revenue premium stands at 117% of industry average and we expect to maintain this performance, while absorbing the industry\u2019s highest increase in stage length and gauge. Internationally we saw improving trends with unit revenues again outperforming the domestic entity for the quarter. Foreign exchange was a 0.2-point tailwind to the system PRASM after three years of currency weighing on our international revenue performance we are positioned to benefit from a tailwind from foreign exchange in 2018. In the transatlantic, unit revenues increased 7.4% on strong business class booking and foreign exchange tailwind. Our branded fare products led the industry providing customers a tailored travel experience with basic economy now selling in over 50% of European routes. We look forward to introducing our premium of select product in the transatlantic market in March. Our Latin entity unit revenues grew 4%, the sixth consecutive quarter of positive unit revenue. In spite of lingering impact from a particularly disruptive hurricane season, we saw strong demand trends across the portfolio and we are already making progress on our alliance integration with Aeromexico as we enter the first full year of the joint venture and we are excited about the upside opportunities. The Pacific entity returned to positive PRASM for the first time in four and a half years. This is especially encouraging as these results included a 7% year-over-year increase in our trans-Pacific stage length. We achieved several important milestones in the multiyear transformation of the region including approval by the U.S. DOT for joint venture with the Korean Airlines and the final retirement of the 747s with deliveries of six A350s within the quarter. The launch of the A350 has been very successful with strong demand and yields for both the award winning Delta One suite and Delta Premium select products. In the first quarter of 2018, the A350 will also be introduced on additional routes, including Detroit-Beijing and Atlanta-Seoul. Our four core hubs have the best connecting structure to drive volume, I am sorry, looking forward, the global economic remains encouraging. Demand remains strong and we expect all four geographic entities to continue momentum in the first quarter. With market fuel prices up 30% year-over-year, we must ensure that we recapture fuel through higher revenues. Based on the industry\u2019s historical recapture trends, we are confident that we will be able to cover this increase in the medium to long-term and our focus is to accelerate this process. March quarter TRASM is expected to increase 2.5% to 4.5% by a 3% capacity growth, which includes 1 point increase in stage length and 2 point increase in gauge. We expect a solid demand environment combined with benefits from our initiatives will produce quarterly TRASM at roughly this level through the year, despite increasingly tougher comps. As we shared at Investor Day, the outlook for 2018 is really exciting as we think about three platforms that will drive Delta\u2019s revenue and earnings growth. The first one is continuing to build more efficient and global airlines. Our four domestic core hubs have the best connecting structure to drive volume, lower cost for employment, and enable continued up-gauging. This is the foundation of our domestic margin expansion for the future. The pipeline of opportunity continues into the next decade as the A321neos that begin delivery in 2020 are 40% more fuel efficient than the current MD88s. Our -- we will have over 45% of our domestic seat departures in the most efficient large gauge, narrow body aircraft type by 2023. The globalization efforts that we have been working on are coming into focus and fruition. In 2018, we are positioned to further leverage the partnerships we have in place, driving an expected $100 million in value with even greater upside to come. Second, we will strengthen our brand and improve the customer experience. Over the next decade, we have more than $12 billion in an airport facility projects planned in Atlanta, LaGuardia, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City and Seattle. We are anticipating future travel trends and technologies to build the airport of the future as we strive to continue improving the Delta experience. And finally, we will continue to enable customer choice as our fleet evolution continues to support our segmentation initiatives. Branded fare has generated an incremental $200 million in the quarter. First Class upsell and Comfort+ revenues grew 25% to 30% for the quarter and post-purchase capability drove $80 million of revenue in 2017 following its mid-year launch. In 2018, we expect $350 million in incremental branded fare contribution, up to $2.2 billion annually, driven by a 5% growth in premium seats from new aircraft deliveries and expanding basic economy. With the favorable macroeconomic environment, international tailwinds and benefits from our commercial initiatives, combined with a great service of the Delta people, we have laid a path for solid topline growth in 2018 and beyond. And with that, I am -- I\u2019d like to turn the call over to my good friend, Paul Jacobson. Paul Jacobson : Thanks, Glen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I\u2019d like to start by echoing Ed and Glen in thanking the Delta team for all they\u2019ve done to take care of our customers and each other through some pretty unprecedented challenges in the last year. For the December quarter, total operating expenses increased $1 billion, driven by a higher fuel and continued investments in our business. Non-fuel unit costs were up 5.6% for the December quarter and up 4.3% for the full year. This includes $85 million of accelerated depreciation, which hit in the back half of the year and pressured our full year CASM by about three-tenths of a point. The investments we made in our product, operation, fleet and our people were important, and are already driving benefits. But as we mentioned before, we cannot sustain unit cost growth at this elevated level over time. We expect the March quarter to be our peak cost growth of the year, with unit costs up 2% to 4%. The majority of our non-fuel expense growth should happen in the front half of the year and we are on a path to achieve zero to 2% non-fuel CASM growth for the full year. In order to get there, first, we will lap costs we began incurring last year with a 6% April employee pay increase. Second, depreciation expense will trail off markedly in the back half of the year, as we annualize the accelerated depreciation on our fleet and facilities. To give some perspective on this, depreciation for 2018 is expected to be up $250 million with $200 million of that increase in the first half of the year alone. Finally, our maintenance expense has been weighted towards the front half of the year as we gear up for summer flying and some aircraft extensions that have been required as a result of the delays and deliveries of the C Series. To meet our remaining cost targets we\u2019ll look primarily to our up-gauging and efficiency initiatives. As Ed said, the delivery of 60 aircraft in 2018 will drive some of the greatest efficiency gains in Delta\u2019s history with over $100 million in expected non-fuel savings this year alone. Then, as I detailed at Investor Day, we have launched an enterprise level project to drive efficiencies across the organization and leverage our scale. We will be looking at things differently and changing the rules on how we manage the business. On a cost base of $27 billion, we believe $200 million of savings this year is definitely achievable. For example, we\u2019re optimizing how we manage fleet complexity in our network. In January, markets with four or more equipment types have been reduced by 60% year-over-year. We will also have all MD88s based in Atlanta by this summer driving approximately $25 million in staffing and maintenance efficiencies alone. Additionally, we have identified other opportunities in network scheduling, hotel spend and transportation. These are just some examples of the opportunities we have ahead of us and we feel good about where we are at this stage in the process. Turning to fuel, our total fuel expense increased $349 million in the quarter, as market prices were 10% higher than the third quarter and 23% higher than prior year. Some of that pressure was offset by the refinery, which contributed $24 million in the quarter and $110 million for the full year. Importantly, the fourth quarter marks the last quarter of the legacy hedge losses, so we are really going to be able to see the benefit that\u2019s being generated by our fuel team. Furthermore, our new aircraft deliveries will drive 2% in fuel efficiency gains in 2018. For the March quarter, we expect our all-in fuel price to be $2.05 to $2.10, which includes the recent run up in fuel prices. Now turning to EPS for 2018, our improved non-fuel cost trajectory along with the topline growth highlighted by Glen will allow us to deliver solid earnings growth this year, with further improvement from the benefits of a significantly lower corporate tax rate, as we discussed at Investor Day. This takes our full year forecasted EPS to $6.35 to $6.70, up 20% to 30% versus 2017. However, the March quarter will see both the peak of our non-fuel CASM growth and the recent run up in fuel prices, which will impact our ability to grow earnings during the quarter. We therefore expect EPS in the range of $0.60 per share to $0.80 per share. This equates to a pre-tax margin of 6% to 8%. And finally, our strong cash generation and investment grade balance sheet allow Delta to execute on our investment opportunities. We generated $1.7 billion of operating cash flow for the quarter, which allowed for reinvestment in the business through $1 billion in CapEx related to aircraft, technology and ground. We also invested $450 million to purchase a 10% stake in Air France-KLM. Looking at the full year, we expect capital spending in 2018 of roughly $4 billion and continue to target CapEx at 50% of our operating cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $435 million of free cash flow used towards the repurchase of $325 million of our own shares and to pay $216 million in dividends. We remain strongly committed to shareholder capital returns and returned a total of $2.4 billion in 2017, the third consecutive year we returned at least 70% of our free cash flow to our owners and we continue to target that level going forward. We also ended the year with $8.8 billion in adjusted net debt and our unfunded pension liability was $7 billion, down $3.6 billion year-over-year. With our pension funded status at 68%, that\u2019s our highest level since 2001, we are well on the path to achieving our pension funding target as we continue to strengthen our balance sheet and remain committed to maintaining our investment grade rating that we worked so hard to achieve. Looking back on 2017, we had a tremendous year for our people, for our customers, for our shareholders and the communities that we serve. We\u2019re poised to build on that success in 2018. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Jill, so we can begin the Q&A. Jill Greer : Ebony, we\u2019re now ready for questions from the analysts, if you could give them instructions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Didora : Hi. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the questions. I guess, first, Glen, you have previously talked about how your -- I think, it\u2019s your corporate contracted business had fares, I think, roughly 20% below where they were in 2014. I guess, can you give us an update on where they stand now and how much of a benefit is in your 1Q PRASM guide for a return of business -- really a return of business travel demand stemming from the tax cuts? Glen Hauenstein : Well, we are very excited about the potential for business -- increased business demand with the tax cuts. We haven\u2019t seen that materialize yet but we expect that to materialize in the first quarter and our guide does not have that, because we can\u2019t see it yet. So the fare levels have stabilized and started to improve. But fare levels are only a few percentage points higher than they were in the trough. So, I think, there\u2019s a lot of opportunity moving forward as demand continues to improve. Andrew Didora : Great. And then, second question is just for Paul, two on the cost side. I guess, one, what is your Brent assumption in your new EPS guidance and did that change from Investor Day? And then, secondly, just the timing of maintenance costs, why is 1Q different from other first quarters in terms of maintenance spend ahead of a busy summer period, are you just expecting to run the network harder or is there something else I am missing there? Thanks. Paul Jacobson : Sure. Good morning, Andrew. Thanks for those questions. On the maintenance question, I would say, it\u2019s a little bit higher than traditional first quarters. As you know, the -- with the mitigation of the C Series delays that we\u2019ve seen, we\u2019ve got a little bit more work to do on the existing fleet versus expecting that the new aircraft we\u2019re going to deliver for the summer schedule. So I would say it\u2019s a little bit disproportionately weighted from that perspective and if you wouldn\u2019t mind, repeat your first question, sorry? Andrew Didora : No. I just -- curious what your assumption for Brent was in your full year guide and did it change since your Investor Day? Thanks. Paul Jacobson : Yeah. Yeah. Sorry about that. We haven\u2019t changed the full year guide. It\u2019s obviously very early in the year. I would say we\u2019re slightly ahead of what our expectations were for 2018 in terms of the rapid pace of the price appreciation. But we have a long way to go and we know that, that is volatile, but we did assume the forward curve as we always do. But we feel okay about where it is right now, but we\u2019re obviously watching it closely. Andrew Didora : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Michael Linenberg : Yeah. Hey. Just a question to Glen, you talked about FX showing up in the international unit revenue having a positive impact. What about the return of fuel surcharges? It looks like that they\u2019re now coming back into the Pacific, are you seeing that, have they increased recently, can you just give us some update on that? Glen Hauenstein : Yes. Clearly, internationally, we\u2019ve seen fuel surcharge increases due to the higher level of fuel and we expect that to continue if fuel stabilizes at this or higher level. Michael Linenberg : Just a question to Paul, can you -- as I recall from the Republic bankruptcy, I believe you own a piece of that, what is the percent and is that being accounted for under the equity method? Paul Jacobson : No. That all - all the changes in value there flow through equity, so it doesn\u2019t -- the ownership itself doesn\u2019t have an impact on the P&L. Michael Linenberg : Okay. But you own -- what is it -- you own what 25% of that, I believe? Paul Jacobson : Yes. Yeah. It\u2019s in the 20%-ish range. Michael Linenberg : Okay. Okay. That\u2019s just being run through the non-op. Okay. Great. Thanks, Paul. Operator : And we will take our next\u2026 Paul Jacobson : No. Hey, Mike. Just to clarify -- yeah, I am sorry, operator. Mike, just to clarify that, no, it runs through the balance sheet, it does not run through non-op because it\u2019s not publicly traded. Michael Linenberg : Okay. Okay. No. Thanks. I appreciate that. That\u2019s helpful. Operator : Our next question will come from Jamie Baker with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Jamie Baker : Hey. Good morning, everybody. First, Paul, I know your trailing view on hedging, but as you\u2019re obviously aware, the market has returned to backwardization now for the first time in, I don\u2019t know, two and a half years, if memory serves. Just wondering if this might influence your thinking on this topic, the hedging topic? Paul Jacobson : No. Jamie, thanks for the question. There\u2019s no change. I think the -- as I\u2019ve said, I am relieved to be able to say the legacy losses are behind us and we feel good about where we are competitively\u2026 Jamie Baker : Okay. Paul Jacobson : \u2026especially the work that we\u2019ve put into the supply side of it, both harvesting the benefits of the refinery, but also looking across self-supply at multiple stations and feel good about where our position is and I think the industry is at a parity level on fuel input costs that it hasn\u2019t seen in quite some time. Jamie Baker : Okay. And second for Glen, I thought Mike\u2019s question on fuel surcharges was a good one, they\u2019re not permitted domestically. I think it was the legion that took a stab a couple of years back unsuccessfully at that to potentially revise that. It does make me wonder and thanks, Mike, I only began to wonder this in about the last 90 seconds, given the current political and regulatory climate, perhaps, you would have a more receptive year in Washington on the topic of domestic fuel surcharges, is that anything we should be thinking about? Ed Bastian : I think I am going to toss that to Peter Carter, our General Counsel because\u2026 Jamie Baker : Okay. Yeah. Perfect. Peter Carter : And Jamie, hi. Good morning. I would say we haven\u2019t given that particular issue much thought, but there is no question that the Trump administration has been very open to the airline industry in general and I think, frankly, business. So interesting question and I appreciate it. Jamie Baker : Okay. Fair enough. Thanks, gentlemen. Take care. Operator : We will take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Glen, can you expand a little bit on your comment about keeping unit revenue growth rates at the level of your March guidance despite a tougher comp, how do you see that playing out? And I wonder -- and sorry if I missed it, would you be willing to rank the geographies in terms of unit revenue growth rates you expect in the March quarter? Glen Hauenstein : Sure. Let me start with the second one first because I think it\u2019s the easiest. I think we would expect the transatlantic to be number one, Latin to be number two, domestic to be number three and Pacific to be number four. So that\u2019s a pretty easy question and the second question was, what again, I am sorry? Duane Pfennigwerth : I think you made a comment in the prepared\u2026 Glen Hauenstein : So our business plan is predicated on 6.5%, 7% total revenue growth or passenger unit -- passenger growth and that equates to a 2% to 3% capacity increase and around a 3.8%, right around 4% unit revenue. So we\u2019re kind of treading at the rate that we need to get to generate that revenue throughout the year. And so we feel pretty good about where we sit today versus what we need to achieve to get to the business plan, which is very different than where we were last year when we started the plan, because if you remember, we were in negative territory last year when we had the same call, the fourth quarter call and we had to move that to positive momentum, but that was a much heavier lift than really just playing out what we had and as you go through the year then just keeping that baseline moving. So I think we feel a little bit better, not that it\u2019s not challenging, not that there won\u2019t be a lot of things we don\u2019t expect between now and December of next year and we know that. But we feel a little bit better about the line of sight to getting from where we are to where we need to be versus last year and turning from a negative unit revenue growth to positive. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thanks, Glen. And if I could sneak one more in on Paul, your operating cash flow was up materially year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Looks like you had about a $700 million working capital benefit, can you talk about what drove that? Thanks for taking the questions. Paul Jacobson : Well, it was a number of things, but I think it also bears mentioning that as a result of our investment grade balance sheet. We have done an initiative with the supply chain to go out and work proactively with our vendors to extend some of our payment terms and do other things to drive working capital in the business. So we were focusing on that very consciously. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Hunter Keay : Sorry. Can you guys hear me? Paul Jacobson : We can now. Glen Hauenstein : We hear you Hunter. Hunter Keay : Sorry. I apologize for that. Are you expecting a headwind from the change in frequent flyer revenue recognition around the airline for the prevailing market rate or whatever it\u2019s called, I think, I had heard about $100 million, is that factored in to the EPS guide or is that a static number, can it change, how are you thinking about that? Paul Jacobson : Hey, Hunter. This is Paul. So, yeah, as we talked about at Investor Day, we don\u2019t expect materially year-over-year changes from revenue recognition on the full year basis. Hunter Keay : Okay. Thank you. And then\u2026 Paul Jacobson : Yeah. Hunter Keay : \u2026 on the 2018 guide, pardon, sorry, Paul, what? Paul Jacobson : No\u2026 Hunter Keay : Sorry. On the 2018\u2026 Paul Jacobson : I was just supplementing that. Go ahead, Hunter, appreciate\u2026 Hunter Keay : Okay. I don\u2019t know if my phone -- I don\u2019t know if my phone is breaking up or I can\u2019t hear you. So, on the 2018 earnings guide, if you find yourself drifting out of the low end of the range for whatever reason, where do you think you have the most incremental opportunity to get back in it? Is it non-fuel costs, is it revenue or is it something else? Ed Bastian : Hunter, this is Ed. I\u2019ll take that. I mean, it\u2019s really premature to be speculating how 2018 is going to be rolling out. We feel optimistic given the guide and our commitment to getting our non-fuel costs back to flat with zero to 2%, but you\u2019ve heard me say before, my expectation is closer to zero than 2%. And the demand environment is the healthiest we have seen in years. And so, I think fuel is a little bit of a wild card there. We\u2019ll see how that plays out. It seems like the market has gotten overheated over the last few months. We\u2019ll see where that settles out. But we feel pretty confident that the -- it\u2019s roughly a 20% to 30% bump year-over-year on EPS is our best look and I wouldn\u2019t get into how do you manage some of the levers, it\u2019s way too early. Hunter Keay : Okay. Thanks Operator : Our next question will come from Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Please go ahead. Darryl Genovesi : Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. At your Investor Day, you had suggested that perhaps if passed -- if Tax Reform were to be passed that there would be some incremental pension contributions. Is that something that you\u2019re looking at for 2018 or would that basically be on hold until 2019 when the cash tax savings kind of starts to appear? Paul Jacobson : That\u2019s right, Darryl. We obviously are not going to see any cash savings in 2018 from Tax Reform since we weren\u2019t anticipating paying any taxes and we still don\u2019t anticipate paying taxes in \u201818. But as we become a taxpayer between \u201819 and \u201820, the reduced level of taxes that we ordinarily would pay, one of the sources for those proceeds would be to continue to fund and hopefully get as close to a fully-funded status in pension over the next several years as possible. So that to me would be high on the priority list. Darryl Genovesi : Okay. Thanks for that. And then, I guess, just on -- I wanted to ask you a little bit about aerospace manufacturer and supplier consolidation. It would appear that the proposed Airbus deal with Bombardier would benefit you in some way, but now you\u2019ve got media speculation that Boeing and Embraer are talking, and you\u2019ve already seen some suppliers get consolidated away over the last couple of years like glitch and the airspace and others. Is this, I mean, would you anticipate this being a problem for you in terms of how you\u2019ll manage your fleet costs over the next few years? Glen Hauenstein : We don\u2019t anticipate that being a significant issue. As you mentioned, the Airbus-Bombardier deal we\u2019re supportive of and we think that will enhance the ability for the C Series to come to market. With respect to further supplier consolidation within the OEMs, we have conversations with all those OEMs and we are certain that we set expectations around performance for them, and ensure that Delta is not harmed from any of that, and we\u2019ve received their commitments that this is actually only going to enhance their service levels to Delta, not put us in a competitive disadvantage. Darryl Genovesi : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question will come from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead. Brandon Oglenski : Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. So, Ed, I wanted to come back to one of your prepared remarks talking about how fuel can drive greater stability in the long run for the industry, I think you were saying higher fuel prices. But then, Glen, also talked about accelerating revenue recapture that the industry historically has done. So, I guess, it\u2019s not the same as Hunter\u2019s question, but we do know fuel costs are higher here, so what are some of the things that Delta can do specifically to help drive that revenue recapture and really push down fuel volatility for your investors? Ed Bastian : Well, our ability to push down fuel volatility is, I think, that\u2019s a little outside our control. We do our best to manage the fuel environment that\u2019s in front of us. I think the biggest thing we have going in our favor in 2018 is a strong economy with a lot of optimism. We\u2019ve got a significant list of commercial initiatives that are coming to fruition. We have a strong international environment, which we haven\u2019t seen in a number of years. So that\u2019s the main focus in terms of being able to recover and recapture fuel. Historically, the industry has always managed spikes in fuel by offsetting reductions in capacity. I think it\u2019s premature and early yet to start to adjust our 2018 capacity plans. But we will look as the next few months unfold, as fuel prices continue on this tear, it certainly will have an impact and we\u2019ll be prepared to deal with that going forward, we know how to do that well. But I think the economy is the biggest benefit and I think that\u2019s the lever we\u2019ll be using to manage the fuel environment. Brandon Oglenski : Okay. I appreciate that. And, Glen, it might just be my phone is not too good here either, but you were talking about three platforms for revenue expansion. I think what I heard was up-gauging and airport investments, but maybe I am simplifying that. So can you come back to some of those longer term revenue initiatives and really focus us in on what are the keys there? Ed Bastian : Sure. I think the key for us domestically is the continued up-gauge strategy and one of the benefits that that provides is a higher level of the premium products and services that have been so successful in the marketplace. If you think about where we started many years ago with selling First Class and then introducing the enhanced Economy products domestically, we\u2019ve come a long way since then and every year we think those products -- how do we continue to mature, well, in some ways they\u2019re very established now. They\u2019re still very young products. They\u2019re only in the marketplace three, four, five years. And some of the things we have on the horizon which we think are really exciting are different ways to be able to buy those products and services. So, for example, if your company\u2019s plan -- travel plan doesn\u2019t allow you to sit in Premium, Economy or in First, this year we allowed you to buy that and a post purchase and we sold almost $100 million of that in the first six months of that being available to sale. By this summer, we\u2019re anticipating being able to now also offer that post purchase in miles and if you think about how that opens the aperture to control your travel experience for people who want to buy those premium products and services, we think that\u2019s going to be key to our ability to drive revenues moving forward. And the fleet itself just in 2018 alone provides for 5% greater seat availability by the end of this year in those premium products and services. So not only do we have the base but we now have the premium products and services and different ways to buy them at different points in the purchase path. And as we continue to work on our digital evolution, we could see expanding that so that we can actually market to you. And those are things that we have coming in the pipeline in the next months and years that we\u2019re really excited about is not driving to the bottom end in the commodity once a year flyer, but to really the people who are discerning and who want to buy premiums in products and services. And we\u2019ve been at the forefront of that for years. We have a very good view of how that\u2019s going to play out over the next couple years and that\u2019s really the cornerstone of our ability to continue to drive premium revenues at Delta. Is that too long? Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Joseph Denardi with Stifel. Please go ahead. Joseph Denardi : Yeah. Thank you very much. Glen, you talked about the strength of the AMEX partnership and record card acquisitions. I think you guys gave the $2 billion -- the $4 billion by 2021 target, I don\u2019t know, a couple years ago, is there upside to that at this point just based on how strong the trends have been recently? Ed Bastian : Joe, this is Ed. I\u2019ll take that. I -- yeah, I think, there\u2019s potential upside too. I\u2019d say again, we got close to $1 billion to go to get there yet and we\u2019re having good success, and we\u2019ve got a great partner at AMEX who is fully committed to that trajectory as well. So we\u2019ll see over the next several years. But it\u2019s safe to say from when we did the deal a couple of years ago we\u2019re running ahead of expectations. Joseph Denardi : Got it. Okay. And then, Paul, just on the guidance for the year, is there anything explicitly in the EPS guidance related to mark-to-market adjustments for your equity investments? Paul Jacobson : No. That\u2019s all timing and out of period, so we wouldn\u2019t be putting that in. Joseph Denardi : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Please go ahead. Jack Atkins : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Ed, if I could ask you sort of a conceptual question about Tax Reform. I guess, the question I\u2019ve been getting a good bit from investors is around potential for this to get competed away over time. And so when you think about the P&L savings from the lower book tax rate related to the Corporate Tax Reform, how do you think about the airline industry potentially competing that away over the next several years and I would have thought given that most U.S. airlines are not cash taxpayers that perhaps it would take some more time to do that, but we\u2019re already seeing some of the airlines not Delta but others who are not cash taxpayers giving cash bonuses. So I am just curious to get your thoughts on the potential for this book tax savings get competed away over the next couple of years. Ed Bastian : Well, Jack, we have no intent to compete away the tax savings. We will certainly use the tax savings to reinvest in the business to strengthen the balance sheet. I mentioned pension is one of the things that we\u2019re focused on. But the core of your question is right. There\u2019s very little cash tax being paid by the U.S. airline industry at this moment. So it\u2019s hard to compete away something you don\u2019t have. I won\u2019t comment on the other airlines giving away cash bonuses to their employees. That\u2019s great for the employees and I am glad to see that. We have a sustainable profit sharing plan over the long-term that has been far superior to any cash bonuses that any of the others have given out and that\u2019s how we pay our employees. So I understand the question. I understand the concern. But it\u2019s pretty hard to compete what you don\u2019t have. Jack Atkins : Yeah. No. That\u2019s definitely fair. One other high level question, would a U.S. withdrawal from NAFTA impact your partnerships with WestJet or Aeromexico? Ed Bastian : I am not going to get into speculation. I don\u2019t know. Jack Atkins : Okay. Okay. Thank you for the time. Operator : We will take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Savi Syth : Hey. Good morning. Just on the entities, I was kind of curious if you could share, one, the capacity growth expectations by entity for the year, and then, two, with the JVs that have kind of recently been strengthened, when should we see that kind of start to flow through and drive more of the revenue upside? Paul Jacobson : So, Savi, good morning. We don\u2019t give into the capacity by region on that detailed level. But on the JV benefits, we\u2019re seeing some of that building in now, you see it coming through both on the revenue lines with the sharing, but also inherent in the Delta P&L with the synergies that we get from the network. There\u2019s a ramp-up period, obviously, as we work through those issues. But I think the international team has done a terrific job and we\u2019ll start seeing those -- some of those benefits in 2018. Savi Syth : Got it. And Paul, if I might just a quick question on the refinery, what\u2019s your expectations there for 2018? Paul Jacobson : So, on the refinery, so 2018 is a turnaround year. We\u2019re currently expecting to have a similar year, but obviously, it\u2019s still very early in the year. But we\u2019ll have some down period especially towards the back end of 2018, but we expect a small contribution from it this quarter based on where cracks are and continue to provide that kind of $0.02 to $0.03 benefit quarter-by-quarter when it\u2019s running. Savi Syth : Got it. All right. Thank you. Operator : We will move next to Helane Becker with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Helane Becker : Thanks, Operator. Hi, team. Thanks very much for taking the time. I have just two questions. One is when you talk about up-gauging, are you talking, is that 100% mainline aircraft that you\u2019re talking about or is there a percentage that\u2019s mainline and a percentage that\u2019s regional? Paul Jacobson : It\u2019s mostly mainline at this point, Helane. Helane Becker : Okay. Ed Bastian : And not just that Helane, as you know, we\u2019ve been shrinking the fleet at the regionals, which has also contributed to that. If you think about the mix of where our fleet evolution, we had I believe almost 800 regional jets at one point in time and we\u2019re down less than half of that now. So it\u2019s not only growing the gauge at the mainline, but reducing the reliance of the regional fleet. Glen Hauenstein : The big up-gauge that we\u2019ve got here in the next couple years is the retirement of the MD80s. We still have over 100 of those that we\u2019re flying and we\u2019ll be retiring them over the next -- by 2020 and bringing those all up to the 321s and 739s, as well as some MD90s as well. So that\u2019s where the bulk of the up-gauge is. Helane Becker : Okay. Perfect. Yeah. I think at one point you guys were the largest operator of RJs in the world. And then my second question is with respect to air traffic control delays in the Northeast and maybe, Ed, this is a question for you, as you plan for the summer months, because I feel like that was the biggest problem last year here in our New York markets, are you thinking about adjusting capacity in this New York, maybe Boston corridor to allow for those delays that we get, what are they, ground stops on a daily basis? Ed Bastian : We do, Helane, as you know we take our operational integrity incredibly important, it\u2019s at the core of what we deliver to our customers, as well as to our employees and to the extent the Northeast corridor continues to be problematic with respect to delays. We take that into account. It\u2019s hard to predict at some level when the storms occur. But we work very closely with air traffic control and with all of our partners out there to ensure that we\u2019re getting the very best intel, transparency and through-put as we can. But it\u2019s a challenging environment. It will stay challenging for everybody up there for a period of time. Helane Becker : Okay. Thank you very much for your help. I appreciate it. Ed Bastian : Sorry. I can\u2019t be more optimistic. Operator : Our next question will come from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Rajeev Lalwani : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the time. Glen, a couple of questions for you on the international side, what gives you confidence that we\u2019re not at some sort of peak, I mean, I think, we\u2019re going to put in about plus 5 on PRASM. And then just relating to that, where do you have more confidence, is it more on the demand side or the supply side? Glen Hauenstein : Well, I think when you read all the headlines about the synchronized global economic expansion, that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re seeing manifesting itself. So we\u2019ve seen not only an uptick in the average realized fare of business travel in the international entities but we\u2019ve also seen an increase in core demand there as well. And so I think that when you think about how the U.S. is probably still growing and still accelerating growth, and when you think about Europe, when you think about the economies in the Pacific, it gives you a lot of confidence that as we move through the year, this is going to continue to improve and our advances would substantiate that. So we have a little bit more visibility on international, because it books earlier than domestic generally and so those two combinations give us a pretty good confidence level that it\u2019s accelerating rather than decelerating. Rajeev Lalwani : And to the extent that tax reform benefits start to come through from a demand perspective, is it fair to say that the domestic side should do a bit better or do you think international would be able to keep up as well? Glen Hauenstein : Well, I am bullish about international for this year, not the least of which, which I didn\u2019t mention in the earlier question -- answer is that foreign exchange becomes a tailwind this year. And we\u2019ve been fighting two or three years of arriving dollar and so now having that also running in our favor is also another great tailwind for international. Ed Bastian : I think it\u2019s also fair to say, Rajeev, that the domestic business should certainly receive a benefit as consumers start to see lower paycheck deductions in terms of lower tax rates as corporations start to invest further to take advantage of the benefits U.S. corporations that the Tax Reform facilitates. I think it\u2019s fair to say that domestic should receive at least as much a benefit as international. Rajeev Lalwani : Very helpful. Thank you. Jill Greer : Ebony, we\u2019ve got time for one more question from the analysts. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Dan McKenzie : Hey. Good morning. Thanks guys for squeezing me in here. Glen, just a couple questions and these are kind of tied to some of the earlier questions, but I would have expected Delta to trim its full year outlook, and of course, that wasn\u2019t the case. So if I can probe just a little bit more on what if anything, has changed versus the Investor Day, and I guess, I am wondering is fuel surcharges and that also going back to your observation about global synchronous growth driving international demand, has there been an improvement in the outlook of your JV partners since the Investor Day? Glen Hauenstein : I am going to turn that over to Paul because he is more in tune with the complete level of the guidance, so Paul? Paul Jacobson : Yeah. Well, I think, we expect some good year-over-year performance from our partners going forward, not just from the synergies, but from their own appreciation. We\u2019ve spoken a lot about the improvement in the economic environment in Latin America in particular as it relates to GOL and to Aeromexico. So they\u2019re a contributing piece to it. But, I think, overall as we look at the year going forward, as Ed mentioned, it\u2019s too early to hit the panic button on fuel prices. The revenue environment has a lot of momentum headed in the right direction. We feel good about where we can hit from the cost side. So it\u2019s a driver, but I think at the end of the day it really comes down to our ability to execute on the plan and continue to watch those external variables. Ed Bastian : Dan, this is Ed. If I could weigh in for a moment, we as an industry have demonstrated our ability to cover higher fuel prices. Don\u2019t forget we were profitable with fuel well over $100 a barrel. And I think over the medium-term, if the new level is at $70, the industry will adjust reasonably quickly to that level. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s three months or six months or nine months. But over time we don\u2019t adjust our capacity or start making short-term decisions based on where the fuel numbers hit on a week-over-week basis. So we\u2019re optimistic, we\u2019re confident, we\u2019ve got all the levers within our control, the most important of which are the best employees and the best customer service in the business that\u2019s going to really cover fuel forever or us. Dan McKenzie : That\u2019s great. Thanks for that, Ed. And then, I guess, just my second question here, just ties to the basic economy part of the business here. We seem to start the quarter out pretty clunky on this and since November was pretty bad, of course, that all changed pretty dramatically in December. And so as we look at the uptick in demand that occurred during the quarter, is it really as simple as increased consumer confidence around the tax cut or did the industry perhaps get a little smarter about how to market basic economy throughout the quarter? Ed Bastian : We don\u2019t think basic economy, as we\u2019ve stated in the past, is a huge driver of the ancillary products and as a matter of fact, the three that we track, it is the smallest contributor to the incremental revenue base. But we do see, as we continue to roll it out internationally, that there are significant benefits and as we move into selling and from selling into flying in the transatlantic, our lowest fares will now have baggage fees attached to them and that\u2019s really a first for U.S. carrier in the transatlantic market. And so we\u2019re looking for that to drive some incremental revenues and really to be very competitive similar to how we are competitive with the ULCCs domestically, a great tool for us to be more competitive in terms of the fare itself with the ULCCs and the transatlantic. And we\u2019re very optimistic about how that will play out in the Consumer segment that we need to be and although, that\u2019s not where we\u2019re making our big investments. Dan McKenzie : That\u2019s terrific. Thanks, guys. Jill Greer : Okay. That\u2019s going to wrap up the analyst portion of the call. I am now going to turn it over to Ned Walker, our Chief Communications Officer. Ned Walker : Hey. Thanks, Jill. Ebony, we\u2019re ready for the media Q&A. Would you please review the process for the media to go ahead as a question. Also for the media, we\u2019d request that you limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. That way we should be able to accommodate most of your questions. Go ahead, Ebony, please. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from David Koenig with AP. Please go ahead. David Koenig : Yeah. Hi. To clarify something that Glen said on the analyst portion about the tax law. So even though you think it\u2019s going to increase business travel that is not in your revised full year EPS guide and can you say anything more about how the law is going to help you since you don\u2019t pay cash taxes? Ed Bastian : David, this is Ed. What Glen was talking about is we don\u2019t -- we haven\u2019t yet seen the evidence that there\u2019s going to be stimulated travel demand given that it\u2019s so early with the law just coming out over the last couple of weeks. But we at the same time are optimistic that the law will help us deliver on our revenue guide, and we do anticipate and we do have factored in our revenue expectations for the year seeing improvements from Tax Reform. The second part of your question that was around competing away the tax benefits, I believe or not seeing the cash. David Koenig : Well, it is\u2026 Ed Bastian : What? David Koenig : No. It was more just if there\u2019s anything else in the law that is going to help you, are you talking about the faster expensing or maybe something else in the other provisions in the law? Ed Bastian : Yeah. I mean, the law in addition to providing a stronger economic outlook for our consumers, it\u2019s going to provide a much stronger economic outlook for Delta. We expect the benefit will probably be about $800 million a year at our current earnings level. We are not a cash tax payer today, but we will be a cash tax payer in the next couple of years and so you\u2019ll see that value ramp as we work off the last remaining NOLs that we have. So it will be a significant benefit for Delta and our owners. David Koenig : Okay Thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Sasso with Bloomberg News. Please go ahead. Michael Sasso : Yeah. Good morning. Yeah. Maybe this is for Ed. Can you tell me, I know there\u2019s some wiggle room in when you expect to take the C Series, but can you for your own -- what are some assumptions you\u2019re making for your own operations --can you tell me what the latest thinking is when you\u2019ll actually take the C Series? And the second part is, what are all the impacts that you\u2019re doing, ways that you\u2019re trying to cope with not having that, are you having to delay or roll back certain routes that you had anticipated? I think Paul mentioned that it\u2019s boosting maintenance costs, just what are some of the impacts that it\u2019s having by having those delay? Ed Bastian : Well, we\u2019re waiting to hear the results of the International Trades Council that is scheduled to rule before the end of January. So I\u2019d say, it\u2019s -- I can\u2019t really respond fully to your question, Michael, until we hear the results in which Boeing was expected to be able to prove harm. So I don\u2019t know what the actual tariff will be, if there is any at all and once we know what that is, then we will set our plans accordingly. With respect to incremental impacts that we are already experiencing, yes, we do know that we will not be taking the C Series according to the current schedule, which we\u2019d be taking delivery this spring. And to that end we have had to invest in maintaining some aircraft, particularly MD88s to keep them around a little bit longer than we were otherwise anticipating. Michael Sasso : And just follow, have you had to delay certain routes and is it just changing how you\u2019re flying that you had anticipated in the next year or two? Ed Bastian : We will make those decisions once we know what the rules are. Operator : Our next question will come from Susan Carey with Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead. Susan Carey : Good morning, everybody. Two little questions, is it still true that your F -- your full year \u201818 EPS includes $1 for the tax cuts? And second question, there was some speculation that Delta was going to go after Georgia Power or the airport/City of Atlanta for the power outage, is there any kind of new thinking on that? Paul Jacobson : Your first question, Susan, yes, $1 is the current ballpark estimate on the value -- the benefit of the Tax Reform that we have rolled into the EPS. With respect to your second question, we are having very productive conversations with Georgia Power, as well as with the airport authority here in Atlanta and the City of Atlanta about, number one, making certain that we learn from the experience. We all persevered in December and ensure that never happens again and putting in the right design and structure, both in the short and long-term to protect our power source with respect to any compensation. It cost us around $40 million and we\u2019ll have the conversations at the appropriate time with those parties. Susan Carey : Thank you. Ned Walker : Ebony, we\u2019ll have time for two more questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Alana Wise with Reuters. Please go ahead. Alana Wise : Hi. Good morning, everybody. Thanks so much for taking my question. So quickly I just wanted to revisit the question of the C Series. At this point it doesn\u2019t seem unlikely that the ITC won\u2019t recommend duties of some sort. So I was wondering would Delta, I know you\u2019ve said in the past that you\u2019re not willing to put the bill, but with Tax Reform having passed, I am curious would Delta be willing to use some of this tax savings to put some off the bill? And secondly, previously Delta said that tax savings would not be used for share buybacks and I was just curious if that was still the case? Thanks so much. Glen Hauenstein : The answer to your first question is, no. We are not using Tax Reform to pay tariffs and subsidies. We have no intent to pay any tariffs on the C Series. And the second question is again, given that we are not seeing a cash benefit in the next couple of years from Tax Reform given that we have NOLs, there\u2019s no cash to go buy incremental shares with. Alana Wise : Thanks so much. Ned Walker : Final question, please, Ebony. Operator : Yes, sir. Our final question will come from Edward Russell with FlightGlobal. Please go ahead. Edward Russell : Hi. I was wondering if you could update us on the status of the Korean Air joint venture? Have you sought regulatory approvals in Korea yet and are you still on track for implementation this year perhaps? Glen Hauenstein : Yeah. We received the approval from DOT to move forward and we\u2019re currently working\u2026 Edward Russell : Yeah. Glen Hauenstein : \u2026 with the Korean authorities together with Korean Air. We anticipate receiving authority sometime hopefully in the first half of this year, is what our Korean counsel tells us. Edward Russell : Okay. And then implementation before the end of the year or in 2019? Glen Hauenstein : As soon as we get approval we\u2019ll move to implementation rapidly. Edward Russell : Great. Thank you. Ned Walker : And actually, Ebony, we\u2019re going to take a question from one more and that\u2019s from our local hometown newspaper, Kelly Yamanouchi. Operator : Perfect. Kelly Yamanouchi with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Please go ahead. Kelly Yamanouchi : Thank you so much for squeezing me in. I just wanted to check, on the impact from the airport outage and winter storm Benji, of the $60 million, so $45 million of that was revenue impact and $15 -- would it be $15 million in cost impact? Ed Bastian : Kelly, this is Ed. $40 million was the rough impact of the outage and $20 million was the rough impact from the winter storm. Kelly Yamanouchi : Oh! I see. Okay. And was most of the winter storm impact on the Atlanta hub? Ed Bastian : On the -- no, it was in the Southeast, as you recall. But the Atlanta hub, obviously, took the biggest impact. We -- if we had 1,200 cancellations, most of which were in Atlanta that day. Kelly Yamanouchi : Okay. Great. Thank you so much. Ned Walker : Hey. Thanks, Ed, Glen, Paul and Peter. That concludes the December Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. We\u2019ll talk again in April. Thanks, everyone. We appreciate it. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Eboni and I will be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the call over to Jill Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Jill Greer : Thanks, Eboni. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our March quarter earnings call. Joining us today from Atlanta are CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Paul Jacobson. Our entire leadership team is here in the room for the Q&A session. Ed will open the call and give an overview of Delta's financial performance. Glen will then address the revenue environment, and Paul will conclude with a review of our cost performance and cash flow. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow up.  Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings.  We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. On January 1, Delta adopted several new accounting standards. All prior-year periods have been recast to reflect the adoption of those new standards. You can find more detail on this and a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ed. Ed Bastian : Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today Delta reported a $676 million margin quarter pretax profit and earnings per share of $0.74, beating consensus by a penny. Our $9.8 billion in revenues were a record for the March quarter and we came in at the high end of our initial profit guidance as that strong revenue performance offset a $0.05 per share impact from severe weather.  We just passed the one-year anniversary of last year's Atlanta storm, an event that we leveraged to improve our response and recovery to irregular operations. Though despite more impactful winter weather in the Northeast this year, we had 52 days in the quarter of zero mainline cancellations. We also had 19 days in the quarter without a single cancellation across the entire Delta system, which is better performance than the first quarter of a year ago. More customers than ever are choosing Delta because of the great service our people provide and the reliability of the product that we deliver. Not only are we seeing record numbers of passengers, we're also seeing solid improvements in our customer satisfaction scores. We reached all-time high Net Promoter Scores in each geographic region in 2017 and recorded a strong 44% rating domestically for the most recent month of February. All these results are a credit to the dedication and determination of the Delta people. Every day, they make a difference to our customers and they are truly our greatest competitive asset. And I want to thank them and say congratulations for starting the year with $183 million already made towards next year's profit sharing payment.  With our people and our culture as the foundation, we outlined a path to grow earnings in 2018 at our Investor Day in December. And we remain confident that we're on track to deliver the key elements of earnings improvement that we laid out at the start of this year. Revenue driven earnings growth, changing our cost trajectory and leveraging our international partnerships. Growing our top line is a priority and we have good momentum. In the first quarter, we delivered 8% top line growth and expect a similar result in the June quarter. Not only are we sustaining a strong revenue premium to the industry, we\u2019re also diversifying our revenue base and driving double-digit gains from other sources like cargo, loyalty revenue and Branded Fares. Now I was also very pleased to see our international revenues grow at a strong pace led by 15% top line growth in the transatlantic. Of equal priority is changing our cost trajectory. Our nonfuel cost growth has been trending at an unacceptably high rate. We need to get that back to 0% to 2% this year. This quarter we saw cost growth step down a couple of points from the December quarter and June will mark our third consecutive quarter of sequentially improving performance. With nearly 50 aircraft still to be delivered this year, we look to our upgauging to drive a lot of efficiency not only this year but well into the future. Our One Delta project is another initiative that uses the learnings from last year\u2019s Atlanta storm for how we can collaborate better across the business. With better efficiency there will be cost savings and this is one way we\u2019ll continue to deliver a best-in-class place to work for our people, a leading product for our customers and top tier investment for our shareholders. So while we still have work to do, we\u2019re moving in the right direction and setting a solid foundation to consistently deliver on our cost targets. Finally, leveraging our international partnerships. While the core of our strength today is the domestic business, we realize our long-term marketplace is the world. No one better connects the world than Delta and today we offer more options than ever before, whether on our aircraft or via our international partners. This quarter we received final approval for our newest joint venture with Korean Air which is expected to launch May 1 and will offer customers world class travel benefits across one of the most comprehensive route networks in the Trans-Pacific market. We\u2019re also working closely with Air France KLM and Virgin Atlantic to finalize a single transatlantic JV. By taking our most established relationships to a new level and creating our first multilateral joint venture, which will be the industry\u2019s largest and most profitable, we can create even more value from these partnerships. It was 10 years ago this week that we announced the Delta Northwest merger and the transformation of our company has been unprecedented. We are financially stronger, enabling us to consistently deliver and invest in a high-quality experience for our customers while still sharing success with our people. We have started the year with solid momentum and we remain focused on revenue-driven earnings growth and the prudent deployment of our cash flows. And we will continue to leverage the strength of our culture, our industry-leading reliability, our unrivaled domestic network, our customer loyalty and brand, and our investment grade balance sheet to create long-term value for Delta\u2019s employees, our owners and the customers and communities that we serve. We\u2019re off to a good start in 2018 and we look forward to maintaining that momentum over the balance of the year. And with that, I\u2019m happy to turn the call over to Glen. Glen Hauenstein : Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone. We are seeing our strongest revenue momentum since 2014 driven by improvements in all geographic regions, strong carpet results and double-digit increases in loyalty revenue. I\u2019d like to thank the entire Delta team for the great service they provide to our customers each and every day, which is what truly drives these strong results. Our March quarter revenue was the highest in our history with 8% top line growth driven by strong demand across all entities and improving business and leisure yields. Corporate revenues also showed an acceleration across all regions, up 7% in the quarter. With domestic fares up 2.8% year-over-year, we have now recovered a quarter of the decline in domestic average corporate fares versus the peak in 2014. We are confident these trends will continue. Our most recent travel survey, which concluded on March 16, noted that 86% of travel managers expected their spend to be maintained or increased in 2Q and beyond. Our revenue momentum is evident across all parts of Delta. Cargo sales were up 23%, our best first quarter performance since 2015, and other revenues grew 13% ex-refinery, driven by a strong 14% improvement in our loyalty. Turning to unit revenues. TRASM was up 5% with all entities again posting positive year-over-year PRASM growth. Close in bookings for February and March showed strong momentum. As a result, we saw accelerating unit revenue performance each month throughout the quarter. Domestic passenger revenue was up a strong 7% on a 4% capacity growth. The domestic entity delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement, with PRASM up 2.5%. All domestic hubs demonstrated unit revenue improvements, with the exception of Seattle, where RASM was flat on a 20% capacity increase during the weakest quarter of the year. Business yields improved by 6 points in the quarter, inflecting to positive in mid-February. We are maintaining a record domestic revenue premium to the industry, despite absorbing the industry\u2019s highest increase in stage length and gauge. Internationally, we saw improving trends with unit revenues up 7.6%, outpacing the domestic entity for the third consecutive quarter. Transatlantic unit revenues increased 12% on strong business class bookings and a 5-point currency tailwind. Strong business cabin performance, a robust summer demand outlook and currency tailwinds are expected to continue to drive positive trends for the entity into the next quarter. In addition, we expect to see continued strength for our Comfort+ product, which we saw an increase of more than 40% in the first quarter versus 2017. Our payload in Comfort+ now exceeds 50%. In close coordination with our JV partners, we are launching several new markets this summer that connect the strengths of our networks, and we are seeing encouraging forward bookings. In our Latin region, unit revenues grew 6%, the seventh consecutive quarter of positive unit revenues for the entity, driven by strong demand trends across much of the portfolio and continued alliance integration. Caribbean performance is encouraging as the region recovers from last year\u2019s hurricanes. However, we are seeing challenges in Mexico as Open Skies drove increased capacity in business markets and travel advisories pressured demand to beach destinations. In the Pacific, unit revenues were up 4% for the quarter on an 8% increase in stage length, the second quarter of unit revenue growth for the entity. We are especially encouraged by the rate of improvement in this region. We are currently seeing all Pacific markets with positive unit revenue momentum. The pricing environment has improved year-over-year as industry capacity growth has moderated. We are seeing strong demand and revenue performance for the Delta One suite and Premium Select as we continued to expand our A350 service across the region. Based on current trends, we believe our momentum will continue to build through the year and allow us to produce positive unit revenues each quarter on increasingly tougher comps. We expect June quarter TRASM to be up 3% to 5% on 3% to 4% higher capacity, which includes 1 point of stage length and 2 points of gauge increases. I\u2019d also remind you that for comparison purposes, last year\u2019s April storms reduced 2017 unit revenues and capacity by approximately 1 point each. Longer term, we\u2019re focused on driving revenues and earnings growth to our network, our brand and customer experience and segmentation initiatives. First, leveraging our domestic network. The U.S. market drives much of Delta\u2019s earnings and margin strength today. Through our upgauging, we can efficiently add capacity, notably in constrained airports and premium time channels, allowing us to further improve our domestic performance. This year, over 70% of our domestic seat capacity growth is coming from upgauging. Second is strengthening our brand and improving the customer experience. We believe that strong customer satisfaction is directly tied to our sustained revenue premium. One of our major initiatives is to further improve the customer experience through our digital transformation. By taking a customer-centric approach to this major technology investment, we can give our employees the data they need to deliver a more personalized level of service. We\u2019re also leveraging our strong brand to drive solid gains through our loyalty program. Last year, the Delta-American Express co-brand portfolio had record acquisitions, and we just had another record quarter. Co-brand spend was up 14% which helped drive $85 million of incremental value from our American Express agreement this quarter, and we\u2019re on track to deliver $3.3 billion in total contribution for the full year. And finally, we continued to expand our segmentation initiatives, offering customers more choices. We have implemented technologies to make the purchase of various fare bundles and products easier for customers and we worked with our JV partners to align branded fare offerings across our partnerships. This quarter, Virgin Atlantic launched a full range of segmented products, and we now offer an aligned basic economy product with both Virgin and Air France-KLM in the transatlantic. We\u2019ve completed a similar effort with Aeromexico as they introduced a product akin to Delta\u2019s long-established Comfort+ in addition to introducing Basic Economy. With our fleet upgauging contributing to an 11% increase in premium seats, we grew first class upsell and Comfort+ revenues over 20% in the March quarter. The Branded Fare momentum combined with future functionality such as post-purchase pay with models, put us on pace to achieve our goal of $350 million of incremental revenue in 2018 and a targeted $2.7 billion of total revenue by 2019. With our employees\u2019 outstanding service, giving customers every reason to keep flying Delta, our commercial initiatives in place and strong revenue momentum building in all geographic entities, we feel we are well poised to deliver solid topline growth throughout 2018. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to my good friend, Paul. Paul Jacobson : Thank you, Glen, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. As we have mentioned repeatedly, one of our top priorities this year is addressing our cost trajectory. For the March quarter, total operating expenses increased $817 million, with half of that resulting from higher fuel prices and higher capacity and revenue related costs. Our nonfuel costs were up 3.9% for the March quarter on 2.7% higher capacity. Over 2 points of this increase were driven by investments we made in our employees and higher depreciation expense due to accelerated aircraft retirements. This cost inflation is a step down from what we saw in the December quarter, but it came in at the high end of our initial guidance due to about a point of pressure from weather and foreign exchange during the quarter. As we move through the year, we\u2019ll continue to see increasing relief on cost as we annualize prior year investments and gain benefits from our upgauging and One Delta initiatives. For the June quarter, we expect our nonfuel CASM to increase 1% to 3%. With depreciation \u2013 while depreciation pressure continues at a similar pace, we have now annualized last year\u2019s employee wage increases and also lapped the Atlanta storm which combined provide a 1.5 point tailwind to CASM for the quarter. Then, as we move into the back half of the year, most of our incremental depreciation trails off after the third quarter providing another half point of CASM relief. From this path alone, we get a cost result in the back half of the year that we expect will be significantly better than our first half performance. But that\u2019s not the whole story. In addition to this, our fleet upgauging and One Delta initiatives can then really help bend the cost curve as we move throughout the year. The delivery of over 60 aircraft this year including the first deliveries of the C Series will drive some of the greatest efficiency gains in Delta\u2019s history with $100 million in expected nonfuel savings this year alone. And our One Delta project with its focus on cross divisional efficiency is expected to generate about $200 million in 2018, and $1 billion a year over the long term. Through this effort, we\u2019re taking a more holistic view of the company. One of the first projects we\u2019ve undertaken looks at the way we build our network and coordinate our scheduling functions. This project is focused on simplifying the process, enabling better communication between all divisions, and ultimately allowing more efficient utilization of our aircraft and facilities. This initiative is expected to generate $100 million of savings this year and $300 million at a full run rate. It will also give us a platform to take our operational performance to the next level, while also driving a better outcome for our customers. Another example of the type of efficiency we\u2019re targeting this year is the creation of a best-in-class transportation group within Delta cargo to serve as the single source for all of Delta\u2019s logistics needs. We\u2019ve also identified opportunities to drive crew hotel scheduling and spend efficiencies. These cargo and hotel initiatives are set to deliver about $30 million this year alone. So we\u2019re making progress on our costs. And we have line of sight to get within our 0% to 2% range for the year but there\u2019s definitely work ahead to get to the lower end, as we\u2019ve said. Looking at fuel, market prices have been volatile in the quarter with Brent trading anywhere between $62 and $70 and most recently hitting $72 per barrel. Our total fuel expense increased $317 million in the quarter as market prices were 8% higher than December and 25% higher than prior year. That pressure was partially offset by a $40 million contribution from our Monroe refinery. It is also important to note that this is the first quarter that Delta wasn\u2019t impacted by our legacy fuel hedges and that will continue for this year. For the June quarter, we expect our all-in fuel price to be $2.07 to $2.12. Nonoperating expenses for the quarter were roughly flat to prior year. Pension expense benefits, which now appear in the nonoperating section, were offset by the seasonality of our 49% partner earnings. For the full year, we expect nonoperating expense to be $200 million to $250 million lower than 2017, due primarily to pension expense savings benefits from our additional contributions and investment performance that we achieved last year. For the June quarter, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $1.80 to $2 per share, which equates to a pretax margin of 14% to 16%. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $1.3 billion of operating cash flow for the quarter which allowed for reinvestment in the business through $1.2 billion in CapEx with $1 billion of that related to aircraft and aircraft modifications. We continue to expect roughly $4 billion in capital spending for 2018 and will continue to target CapEx at 50% of our operating cash flow. In the quarter, we generated $173 million of free cash flow and returned $542 million to shareholders through $325 million in share repurchases and $217 million in dividends. In January, we completed our 2018 pension funding with a $500 million voluntary contribution. Assuming current discount rates, our unfunded pension liability is improved by roughly $1 billion since the end of 2017 showing further benefit from last year\u2019s accelerated contribution. This is just one example of the opportunities we have unlocked with our investment-grade balance sheet. And going forward, we expect to have more opportunity to continue transforming our balance sheet by refinancing from secured to unsecured debt which will further increase our pool of unencumbered assets while also reducing our interest costs. We will also finance a portion of our LaGuardia redevelopment project using tax-exempt bonds as we harness the value of our investment-grade rating and maintain control of the project from a construction and cost-management perspective, which will yield long-term benefits for us in New York. In closing, we delivered solid earnings for the first quarter with expected strong revenues across our businesses and improving cost trajectory and continued benefits from tax reform. The outlook remains very positive, and we are on track to drive significant earnings growth in 2018. I also want to pass along my thanks to the entire Delta team for their hard work in these efforts.  And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Jill to begin the Q&A. Jill Greer : Thanks, everyone, and, Eboni, we are now ready for questions from the analysts if you could give instructions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Joseph Denardi with Stifel. Please go ahead. Joseph Denardi : Yeah, thanks very much. Ed, Marriott trades at 22 times earnings because they have a business where they put their logo in front of a property and collect a cut of the revenue with no operating risk. Delta has arguably an even better business where you put your logo on a credit card and take a cut at the spend. Your stock trades at seven times earnings. My question is do you think you can apply what you learned in forming these partnerships with foreign carriers in a way that better incentivizes both parties. Can you apply that to solve the challenge airlines have faced in trying to separate the marketing company from the airline business so the market can more appropriately value the two? Ed Bastian : Hi, Joe. We have had this discussion now for a year or two. One of the things I think\u2019s real important is that we\u2019ve aimed to provide better transparency and disclosure around the basis and the foundation of some of your comments, looking into the loyalty arrangement and the profitability that it drives. And hopefully the marketplace is seeing that, that we\u2019ve got a more sustainable and durable base revenue stream that\u2019s a bit \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say disconnected, but it\u2019s not fully dependent upon the airlines in and of itself. Over time, if we are unable to get our valuation to where we think it needs to be, we\u2019re open to options and ideas. But I\u2019d say it\u2019s premature to come to that conclusion at this point. Joseph Denardi : Very helpful. I\u2019ll leave it at one. Thank you. Ed Bastian : Great. Operator : Our next question will come from Jamie Baker with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Jamie Baker : Hey. Good morning, everybody. Glen, a question on the domestic and without asking for market specificity, what are your lowest-performing routes have in common? Is it low-cost carrier overlap? Is there a common trade in terms of gauge? Or is it simply where capacity is up the most that your domestic RASM is weakest? You mentioned Seattle in your prepared remarks. Obviously, the system as a whole functioning well, but always curious where underperformance is more acute. Any more color? Glen Hauenstein : Underperformance in terms of revenue or P&L? Jamie Baker : Preferably P&L. Glen Hauenstein : So I think we\u2019ve talked about this before, is that generally when we can get to gauge \u2013 and this is why our gauge story is so important to us, when we can get to the right operating gauge, we can compete in almost every sector, whether or not it\u2019s against a ULCC, whether or not it\u2019s up against legacy carriers. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re really focused on getting the right gauge aircraft into the airline. Generally, where we tend to lose money is where we can\u2019t get to scale. So the smaller equipment type in almost every class is the least profitable. So I think that\u2019s why we\u2019re so excited about the plan to bring in higher gauge to Delta and drive almost all of our growth through that higher gauge, because we think it\u2019s a much more robust and sustainable model. Jamie Baker : Okay. Perfect. And a question for Ed, you had a narrative at one point that Delta should be valued more in line with its high-quality industrial transport peers. And you seem to have de-emphasized or, I don\u2019t know, backed away from that messaging as of late. Is that because you no longer believe it? Because it wasn\u2019t working? Or some other reason? Ed Bastian : No. We still believe that. I think that we need to prove it. And rather than \u2013 I think we\u2019ve made the point and I think the comparisons are clear to any of our owners. There\u2019s obviously something within the durability of our business framework that we need to continue to prove over time and we\u2019re seeking to do that. So I think the point was made and there\u2019s no reason to continue to beat that same drum. Jamie Baker : Okay. That\u2019s fair. Appreciate it. Take care, everybody. Operator : Our next question will come from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Hunter Keay : Hey. Thank you. Good morning. So it looks like your passenger ticket revenue is 77% of your total revenues, which is down a little bit year-on-year. How low can you get that number in the long term? Do you think you can get that down to like two-thirds, because I would presume the lower you can get that mix, the higher your earnings multiple would go. Would you agree with that? Ed Bastian : That\u2019s an interesting question, Hunter. We don\u2019t necessarily look at it in that light. We certainly are looking, as I said in my earlier comment to Joe, about diversifying our revenue streams. But there\u2019s no question, our non-ticket-based revenues. And it\u2019s been for some time now, it\u2019s been growing at a much faster clip than the ticket revenues. And as we bring segmentation and more customized marketing to bear, you\u2019ll see those trends continue. We\u2019ve never set a target as to where that should be, though. Hunter Keay : Okay. And then, Ed, just to clarify, are you still on track with the 2018 EPS guidance range? Ed Bastian : Yes, we are. Yes, we are. I know a number of people have been asking and talking about that over the course of the last few weeks. We continue to still expect to be in the range, and I think it\u2019s premature to conclude otherwise. Our Q1 was on plan. We expect the same largely in Q2 as well. Revenues are strong and we\u2019re running ahead of plan. Our nonfuel costs are up a little bit, but we still expect full year to be in the target range and the wild card is obviously fuel. It\u2019s currently probably $5 or $6 a barrel ahead of plan at this point, but it\u2019s been bouncing all around over the course of the year-to-date. It really depends on our ability to price it and the time lag required. But it\u2019s only been at this $70 level here for a couple of weeks, so I\u2019d say it\u2019s premature to conclude on a full-year basis as to whether that\u2019s going to continue in place. Hunter Keay : All right. Thank you. Ed Bastian : Welcome. Operator : We will take our next question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Mike Linenberg : Yeah, actually, two questions here. Ed, just on the running higher-than-planned that you had mentioned I think oil in the same sentence, if we go back to December when you were guiding to 4% to 6% revenue growth for the year and you did reiterate that in this release, were you \u2013 was your forecast at that time, was it at 8% topline growth in the March as well as June quarters? Or is topline also running higher than planned than what you were thinking back in December? Ed Bastian : Yeah, topline is running higher than plan in December. I forget the exact plan number for Q1, but we\u2019re running a good healthy clip ahead of plan. Mike Linenberg : Okay. Great. And then just my second question to Paul. In the non-op area where you\u2019re getting that $200 million to $250 million reduction due to lower pension expense, does some piece of that find its way into the interest expense line as well? Paul Jacobson : Hey. Good morning, Mike. No, it all sits in the other income line and non-op. Mike Linenberg : Okay. Great. Okay. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to Helane Becker with Cowen. Please go ahead. Helane Becker : Thanks, operator. Hi, everybody. Thank you so much for the time. I\u2019m not sure who should answer this question, but when you think about your Net Promoter Score and the improvement you\u2019ve seen over the bunch of years since the merger and so on, is it possible to get to a level of 100? Paul Jacobson : Helane, I\u2019ll take that. No, it\u2019s not possible to get to a level of 100. You would want to see the cost profile that it would take to get to 100. Helane Becker : Okay. So that\u2019s not necessarily a goal. Do you have like a goal in mind for that? Or are you happy where it is right now? Paul Jacobson : Our domestic Net Promoter Score is in the mid-40s range. Internally, we would like to get that to 50 and then evaluate the cost benefits of continuing to increase it. Helane Becker : Okay. That\u2019s great. Actually, all my other questions have been \u2013 most of my questions have been asked and answered. I\u2019ll just leave it at the one. Thanks, team. Paul Jacobson : Great. Thanks, Helane. Operator : Our next question will come from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead. Brandon Oglenski : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Ed, not to beat a dead horse here, but I want to come back to Hunter\u2019s question on the guidance because if we do hold the fuel constant here, $72 or $71, that would represent about 2 to 3 points of incremental cost relative to where you were guiding, and you\u2019re still talking about topline of 4% to 6%.  So I guess the bigger long-term question here is earnings are going to be roughly flat or maybe slightly up this year but in a cyclically very strong environment, and we\u2019re still down from a couple years ago on an operating basis. What can you tell shareholders that you can change in the formula that can offset these fuel headwinds over time? Ed Bastian : Well, I don\u2019t view fuel in the $70 range as a big headwind. In fact, it creates a lot more discipline about the business, and we\u2019ve certainly proven the ability to make some very solid returns at this fuel price in the past. If you were to assume the $70 price range were to hold for the balance of the year, I think that would require about 1 point of additional RASM, plus or minus, to cover it. And we\u2019ll see. I think it\u2019s premature as I said to say $70 is the new normal. The curve, as you know, is still backward dated, so if you were to take a market, market price is actually lower than that today. And I do think there\u2019s a tremendous amount of revenue momentum that we\u2019re seeing, and I think the industry as a whole is needing to price for this. This is not a unique Delta challenge. This is the industry, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve had good success. Brandon Oglenski : But I guess that\u2019s what investors are asking here. What will drive that pricing upside? And should we just assume it\u2019s going to appear? Ed Bastian : Pricing? You\u2019re saying what would enable us to cover that cost of pricing? Well, it\u2019s going to be several things. First of all, it\u2019s going to be the strength of the economy. You have to look into what\u2019s driving the underlying reason why fuel is up. It\u2019s going to be the strength of our branding, our product strategies. Glen can add a little bit more on this, more color, but we believe through our Branded Fares, our international partnerships are really paying off. We\u2019ve been investing for a number of years. As you know, that\u2019s been the most challenged part of the business over the last two years, and it\u2019s rebounding at a very strong clip. Our transatlantic RASM was up 12% in the quarter. So there\u2019s a lot of underlying strength on the top line, and we\u2019ll continue to see it over time. Glen? Glen Hauenstein : Yeah, if I could just add, there\u2019s a huge correlation between airline revenues and fuel price, but it does take a little bit of time both directions, up and down, before it\u2019s absorbed into the marketplace. And so over the past few weeks, we\u2019ve seen a fairly rapid run up. Under normal circumstances with a growing economy, we would see that roll into fares probably in the 90- to 120-day range, but it has to stay there, and I think as it\u2019s fluctuating around, it\u2019s premature for us to start speculating as to how much of that would be captured in forward revenues. Brandon Oglenski : Okay. I appreciate the response. Glen Hauenstein : Sure. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey. Thanks. Paul, just wondered if you have any new thinking regarding hedging longer term? I know at one point you were studying the use of out-of-the-money call options. Just wondered, given this backwardation into 2019, if you\u2019re studying that anymore? Paul Jacobson : Good morning, Duane. Hey, look, we\u2019re always taking a look at trying to make sure we\u2019re managing risk in the business. We have no plans to add any hedges at this time, and we\u2019ll continue to look at it. But again, I think we\u2019re pretty happy with where we sit right now. We\u2019re driving a lot of efficiencies in the business in which we buy fuel and that\u2019s creating a nice sustainable advantage competitively, and we feel good about where we sit in the fuel line. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thanks. And then just for my second, broadly how you\u2019re thinking about the buyback? Maybe you could just remind us on where you are with the existing authorization, and with this very generous free cash flow, how you\u2019re thinking about growing the buyback this year. Thank you. Paul Jacobson : Sure, Duane. So we, as we\u2019ve talked about throughout the quarter, we\u2019re on track with the new $5 billion authorization which was launched last year. We\u2019ve completed about $1 billion of that and expect to complete that by the middle part of 2020, in line with the plans that we talked about last year. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Please go ahead. Jack Atkins : Hey. Good morning. A couple revenue questions for me. First, on business fares domestically, with business confidence at cycle highs, what really needs to happen either from a macro perspective or from a company-specific perspective to really get that remaining 75% of the loss, corporate fares, back into the revenue line? Glen Hauenstein : We\u2019re working on that every day, and the dynamics competitively domestically have changed a lot over the last couple of years. But we don\u2019t see any real impediment to be able to get back there over time. And so every day we\u2019re working to get those up, and it\u2019s at a market level, it\u2019s at a understanding our customers better level. And I think we\u2019ve shown in the first quarter, anyway, what I would consider to be some industry-leading results in terms of our ability to capture that. And we see that momentum continuing into the second quarter. Jack Atkins : Okay. Great. Thank you. And then, Glen, just following up on your comments earlier on the cargo side of the business, clearly global air freight, the global air freight market is quite strong and continues to be strong driven by global trade and e-commerce demand. Your cargo revenues jumped nicely in the quarter, up 24%. How much more opportunity is there for you on the cargo side? Because it just seems to me like belly space could be seeing increasing load factors globally, just given that main deck freighter capacity is essentially sold out globally at this point. Glen Hauenstein : We\u2019re still a couple hundred million dollars below what our peak in cargo was just a few years ago, so I think there is continued momentum if we can, again, get back to those historic levels. Paul Jacobson : If I can just add to that, Glen, I think the cargo team is doing a fantastic job, and where we have upside is to align the reliability and the quality of the airline into the cargo operation. They\u2019ve done a great job of getting that, improving customer service, and driving the premiums that we should expect with the type of reliability the operation can drive. Glen Hauenstein : Great point. Jack Atkins : Okay. Great. Thank you for the time. Operator : Our next question will come from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Savi Syth : Hey. Good morning, everyone. I think, Glen, last time, last quarter on the call, based on current \u2013 the trends at the time, you\u2019d expected Atlantic and Latin to be the best and then maybe domestic and Pacific last. So just kind of curious given the strength, kind of the way that it came out this quarter, is that a function of domestic being weaker than you had thought at that point? Or maybe Pacific performing better? And also just to follow-on, what were kind of the biggest drivers of the Pacific improvement? Glen Hauenstein : Pacific has been a great surprise as we moved through the year, and my hat\u2019s off to our Pacific team who is really doing a great job managing a very robust business demand. I think when you think back to Brexit and whether or not you thought Brexit would cause more or less business demand to the UK, I think most of us would have prognosticated that Brexit would present a challenge for business traffic to the UK.  In reality, business traffic to the UK has never been stronger. And so as we think about a lot of what\u2019s going on in the press, we are apprehensive and monitoring very closely how business travel is going back and forth to China, but all we\u2019ve seen is continued improvements and continued strength in that. So China, Japan, South Korea, all showing incredible strength. Savi Syth : Just to follow on that, is kind of the partnership with Korean, so we should kind of expect some kind of increased momentum as that kind of gets solidified and into the network? Is that fair? Glen Hauenstein : Yes. We have had, as we\u2019ve mentioned in earlier calls, a multiyear restructuring of our international Pacific capacity away from our hub in Tokyo and towards nonstop flying into the major points in China. Now we\u2019ll continue to refocus using Korea as our main distribution platform for secondary and third-tier cities in Asia, and we\u2019re off to a great start with our existing services, and we\u2019ll be building on that over the next years. Savi Syth : Helpful. Thank you. Operator : We will move next to Darryl Genovesi with UBS Financial. Please go ahead. Darryl Genovesi : Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. It looks like your [indiscernible] for the second quarter combined with what you did in the first is trending towards the top end of the range for the year, even a little bit above. Should we expect a deceleration in the second half? Paul Jacobson : So we said three for the year. We\u2019re at a little bit over that for this quarter with 1 point of that attributed to the year-over-year storm impact. Darryl Genovesi : Okay. And then when we \u2013 I think the last couple of times that you guys have spoken, you have alluded to CASM being towards the \u2013 or that you hoped that CASM will be closer to the lower end of the range. Paul, your commentary today sounded like it had slightly different tone. Do you still think you can get into the lower half of that range this year? Paul Jacobson : Hey. Good morning, Darryl. Yeah, I think that that is still our target, our goal, and our expectation. I think what we were trying to do on the call today is give the market a progress update on the initiatives that we\u2019ve talked about through the year, but we still feel good about hitting those full-year targets. Darryl Genovesi : Okay. And then just one quick bookkeeping one. On the non-op, the $200 million to a $250 million decline, that is a change or was that fully contemplated in the original guidance and you\u2019re just disclosing it for the first time? Paul Jacobson :  It was fully contemplated in our original plan. Darryl Genovesi : All right. Thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Next we will move to Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Rajeev Lalwani : Good morning. Glen Hauenstein : Good morning. Rajeev Lalwani : Glen, a question for you. Can you just talk about your expectations around Domestic and International as the year progresses in terms of the spread between the two. I guess I\u2019m just trying to figure out whether Domestic has the opportunity to catch up to International or if International is going to be coming in. Glen Hauenstein : I think that Domestic represents such a huge revenue pool for us. To imagine that Domestic would move like the Transatlantic and be up 12 is a little bit of a stretch, but we see solid progression through the year, and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on is to continue that momentum. As you know, last year was our first year, our first quarter of year-over-year positive revenue momentum. So keeping that trajectory going over an ever-increasing base is our goal, and we think it\u2019s very achievable. Rajeev Lalwani : [indiscernible] just a quick one for you. Obviously, very committed to hitting the earnings numbers for the year. You seem on track. Would capacity at all be a lever for you to maybe get there assuming that the pricing environment is in good shape? Glen Hauenstein : You zoned out there. Is your question will capacity changes help keep us in our full-year guidance range? Rajeev Lalwani : Yeah, that\u2019s right. Or is it something you would consider assuming that the pricing environment is holding obviously? Glen Hauenstein : We\u2019re comfortable with our capacity for the year. We\u2019re generally within the range that we gave at the start of the year with respect to guidance. There are changing over the course of year. Some of the international strength certainly cause you to think there\u2019s a little more you could do there. But, fundamentally, no. Our capacity is what it is and those types of changes need to be seasoned over a much longer period of time. We can\u2019t adjust them on the dime. Operator : Caller, did that answer your question? Glen Hauenstein : I think it did. We can go to the next one. Rajeev Lalwani :  It did. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Dan McKenzie : Oh. Hey. Good morning. Thanks, guys. Glen, with respect to the plan for overall full-year growth of 2% to 3%, what\u2019s the growth in Premium seats for the year, and if you have it for the back half of the year? My thought is just given the upgauging this year. The Premium seats are probably up more than 2% to 3%. And I guess I\u2019m just trying to peel back the onion on how the Premium seats sort of tie into RASM and how the average fare premium for these seats \u2013 what kind of average fare premium these seats might garner versus an average fare across the system. Glen Hauenstein : That\u2019s really one of the backbone, if you will, of our commercial strategy is to continue to increase the number of Premium seats we have in the marketplace using the upgauging strategy as the main vehicle for that. So we will have double-digit increases throughout the year in terms of Premium seats in the marketplace. And the premiums that we get on that depending on the product range from 10% to 2 times the average coach fare. So that\u2019s really a key driver for us, and I think one of the reasons we were able to post what I would consider to be superior revenue numbers for the first quarter. Dan McKenzie : There we go. Thank you. And then, Paul, with respect to the 50 aircraft that are yet to be delivered this year, what\u2019s the philosophy on aircraft financing at this point, and where would that leave net adjusted debt at year-end? And I guess where I\u2019m going with that is as you think about your pool of capital returned to shareholders, obviously, I heard you loud and clear on the $5 billion buyback, just trying to get a sense of how financing may help either expand or with respect to your leverage metrics. Glen Hauenstein : I think we lost the caller. Dan McKenzie : Hello? Glen Hauenstein : Dan, are you there? Dan McKenzie : Yeah, sorry. I\u2019m not sure. Paul, can you hear me? Paul Jacobson : We can hear you now. Dan McKenzie : Oh. Okay. Great. Sorry about that. My second question was for Paul. And it\u2019s just with respect to the 50 aircraft yet to be delivered this year, I was just wondering what the philosophy is on aircraft financing and where that might leave net adjusted debt at the end of the year. Paul Jacobson : Sure, Dan. Sorry about the technical difficulties. We continue to lease some of our deliveries, but we\u2019re predominantly paying aircraft with cash, improving our unencumbered asset base and continuing to provide cushion and flexibility for the future. The leased aircraft portfolio, as we\u2019ve discussed, is getting back into our targeted range of 20% to 25% of the fleet. It had gotten as low as 7% or 8% during the peak of our de-levering. We want that for long-term future flexibility, residual-value management, et cetera. And on the debt point, we\u2019re very comfortable where our debt sits today. We are comfortably in all the investment grade metrics that we target and we\u2019ll continue to monitor that as we go forward. So no material change to our plans or significant desire to increase or decrease debt materially. Dan McKenzie : Okay. Thanks for the time, you guys. Operator : Our next question will come from David Vernon with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks for taking my questions. This is Leo Vasquez [ph] on behalf of David. So we\u2019ve had Alitalia and EasyJet holding talks, could you comment on the potential impact for the SkyTeam and codeshare plans. Paul Jacobson : Unfortunately, we cannot. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you. Jill Greer : And, Eboni, this is going to be our last question from the analysts. Operator : Thank you. Our final question from the analysts will come from Susan Donofrio with Macquarie bank. Please go ahead. Susan Donofrio : Yes. Good morning. My question is on your new Branded Fares across the Atlantic. I\u2019m just wondering how we should be thinking about it as far as whether you think it\u2019s going to further drive top line growth that would have happened anyway from strong demand? Or should we view it as more of a defensive strategy across the Atlantic against new competition? Paul Jacobson : I think that people like to categorize our products and service as defensive or offensive or \u2013 but really what we\u2019re trying to do is we\u2019re trying to give customers what they want to buy from us. And if you think about the evolution of airlines, because of the way we distributed tickets historically, we weren\u2019t able to provide more customized products and services to individual purchasers. They were based on two or three classes of service and distribution through monolithic GDSs which a ticket was a ticket was a ticket. So this is really just a natural evolution of us trying to provide best-in-class services no matter what your travel needs are.  So if you\u2019re able to pack a suitcase in an overhead bag, why would we charge you for handling baggage? So I think it allows us to provide a variety of products and services starting from a very basic customer who is willing to forego some of more historic attributes of a coach ticket in order to get a lower fare all the way up to our very premium services where we have the finest champagnes and the flatbed seats with direct aisle access and the Delta One suites. So we\u2019re really excited about this, this change in Delta\u2019s ability to sell to our customers, and we think that it\u2019s been well accepted by the marketplace and that customers are finding value in it. Susan Donofrio : Great. And then just as a follow up, I notice that your transatlantic partners are calling their Branded Fares different names. Would we expect, as you further integrate your transatlantic JV, that you\u2019ll start having a little bit more standardization of some of the fare products? Paul Jacobson : I think that the first thing which was so great to do is to get the alignment on what those products are, and I think over the next five years we would like to see more convergence with our partners on the products and services, absolutely. Does that involve them being bioidentical, if you will? Probably not. They\u2019ll all have nuances in it. But I think what we launched with Air France-KLM and what we\u2019ve launched with Virgin and what we\u2019ve launched with Aeromexico is a great step forward. Although the nomenclature and the languages sometimes are different, the value proposition in the tickets are identical, and that\u2019s a really big step forward for us. Susan Donofrio : Okay. Great. Thank you. Jill Greer : Thanks, Susan. Thanks, everyone. That is going to wrap up the analyst portion of the call. And now I will turn it over to Ned. John Walker : Okay. Hey. Thanks very much, Jill. Eboni, we\u2019re ready to begin the media call. If you don\u2019t mind, would you please review the process for asking a question. Also, I\u2019d like to ask the media to limit themselves to one question with a quick follow up. That way, we should be able to address most questions. Eboni? Operator : Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question with Alana Wise from Reuters. Please go ahead. Alana Wise : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the call and taking my question. So there was some mention earlier about business traffic to the UK, and it just made me a little bit curious about whether or not Delta is preparing for the possibility of a slowdown as the effects of Brexit begins to take effect later. And are there concerns that changes to the current U.S./UK open-skies agreement could have a negative effect oven Delta\u2019s Transatlantic business? Glen Hauenstein : Sure. We monitor this on almost a daily basis and of course we react to changes in demand profiles as quickly as we can. And we\u2019re looking at as far as we can see right now and we see no trail-off in business demand for the UK at all. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s very robust right now. But if indeed it does change we will react to it, of course. As far as the open-skies agreements, we think that there will be no real significant change in the way we operate to the UK or to Europe from any of the changes in Brexit. Alana Wise : Fantastic. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Sasso with Bloomberg News. Please go ahead. Michael Sasso : Good morning. You may have seen news out this morning that the owner of British Airways, IAG, has taken a stake in Norwegian and may bid for the entire thing. I wonder if you\u2019d just comment, one, about how you see that affecting capacity or just the market across the Atlantic. And the bigger question is do you see anyone else, potentially Delta or anyone else, buying a share or potentially all of Norwegian? Ed Bastian : Michael, this is Ed. I don\u2019t know what British Airways\u2019 plans are. I think you\u2019re probably better off asking them. And no, we don\u2019t have any plans to invest in Norwegian. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to Doug Cameron [ph] with Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Quick couple from me. That was a long hour, everybody, a long hour. I\u2019ll never get it back. Just on Norwegian, Ed, do you still oppose their \u2013 the granting of the licenses by DOT? You\u2019re obviously vocal in your opposition and there\u2019s still been lingering calls from some of the unions. Do you think those Transatlantic licenses for the UK and Irish units should be revoked? Glen Hauenstein : Doug [ph], we haven\u2019t engaged on that topic in some time, so I wouldn\u2019t be in a position to respond to that at this moment. Unidentified Analyst : But you did engage in it for three years. Glen Hauenstein : Yes, we did, and I think we\u2019ve moved on. Unidentified Analyst : You\u2019ve moved on. Very good. Okay. Just a quick one. You talked about the AmEx site and the card revenue, et cetera. If you were to pick two or three of the shall we say nonoperating, nonflying revenues, where would you expect or would you hope to see most growth going forward in the medium term? Glen Hauenstein : I think the AmEx relationship, which has been growing at a double-digit clip, will continue to grow at a double-digit clip, which is significantly outside the run rate of the core airline business. So I think that\u2019s a significant improvement. Our cargo and MRO businesses are also doing very well especially with the introduction of the geared turbofan into our fleet and I think those are easily double-digit growth businesses for us, certainly over the next number of years. And then the Branded Fares initiatives as we continue to segment and merchandise the product better will grow as a faster clip than ticketed revenues, which mentioned on the call. I don\u2019t know how much more is out there, but I think there\u2019s a considerable improvement potential and I think those are a more durable base of revenues, all of those that I mentioned going forward, which adds to our overall foundation in terms of the strength and sustainability of the business model we\u2019ve created. Unidentified Analyst : That\u2019s really useful. Thanks very much. Look forward to seeing those C Series. Glen Hauenstein : Yeah, me too. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to Ted Reed with Forbes. Please go ahead. Ted Reed : Thank you. I guess my question is for Glen. There\u2019s some reporting that I know international growth [indiscernible] particularly transatlantic is great but there\u2019s some reporting that leisure traffic from Europe and elsewhere is weak. Can you comment on that? Glen Hauenstein : We don\u2019t see that. We see record travel between the U.S. and Europe in both directions for peak summer of 2018. So I\u2019d say we are selecting traffic from the U.S. over traffic from Europe because the fares are higher out of the U.S. than they are out of Europe. They have been historically higher for the last 20 years, and that trend continues. So to the extent that we can favor U.S. origin traffic in peak, we do. But the total traffic to Europe we think will be record-breaking this year. Ted Reed : All right. Thank you. Glen Hauenstein : Okay. Eboni, we have time for one more question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our final question will come from Edward Russell with FlightGlobal. Please go ahead. Edward Russell : Thank you for taking my question. I was wondering if you could provide any more detail on the number of C Series, and when the first aircraft will arrive this year? Ed Bastian : Our plan is to take the first C Series by the end of the year and probably induct it into the service at the start of 2019. Edward Russell : And do you know how many you plan to take this year? Ed Bastian : In calendar 2018? Edward Russell : Yes. Ed Bastian : It\u2019s just a handful in the fourth \u2013 it\u2019s just a handful in the fourth quarter. Edward Russell : Thank you. John Walker : Okay. We appreciate everyone\u2019s time, and Ed, Glen, Paul, thank you very much. This will conclude the 2018 March Quarter Earnings Call, and we\u2019ll be back in July. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Again, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Alan. I will be your coordinator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. Now I would like to turn the conference over to Jill Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Jill Greer : Thanks Alan. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for our June quarter earnings call. Joining us today from Atlanta are CEO, Ed Bastian, our President, Glen Hauenstein and our CFO, Paul Jacobson. Our entire leadership team is also here in the room for the Q&A session. Ed will open the call and give an overview of Delta's financial performance. Glen will then address the revenue environment and Paul will conclude with a review of our cost performance and cash flow. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted and you can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. With that, here's Ed. Ed Bastian : Thanks Jill. Good morning everyone. I appreciate you joining us today. Earlier, Delta reported a $1.6 billion June quarter pretax profit and earnings per share of $1.77, beating consensus of $1.72. Our EPS was up 11% over last year driven by tax reform benefits and the lower share count. Our revenues grew 10% to $11.8 billion, a record level for the June quarter. We have seen early success in addressing the fuel cost increase and we did offset two-thirds of the $600 million impact from higher fuel in the June quarter. While this is good progress, there is still more to be done. Strong demand, a recovering fare environment and momentum across our business will all be critical as we work to fully recapture higher fuel costs. I would like to thank the Delta people for all their doing, especially during our busiest time of the year. With a record 50 million passengers this quarter, more customers than ever are choosing Delta because of the great service our people provide and the reliabilities of the product that we deliver. We are running the world's best operation and our people continue to raise the bar. For the first half of the year, we have had 58 days without a single cancellation across the entire Delta system, an improvement of 23 days versus the same period last year. This is continuing in July. I would like to congratulate our Delta connection team as they are currently on a 12-day streak this month without a single cancellation. Our customer satisfaction scores demonstrate that we are increasingly a carrier of choice. Year-to-date, we are seeing a domestic net promoter score of 44%, up three points versus the prior year. This is all a testament to our employees and it's an honor to recognize them with $400 million accrued in profit sharing this quarter and $23 million in shared rewards. Our people are the best in the business and it's our employees and our culture that are Delta's strongest competitive advantage. Since our last call, we have seen a significant increase in fuel prices and now expect our fuel expense to increase by about $2 billion for the year. Our new EPS guide of $5.35 to $5.70 per share reflects both higher fuel and a stronger revenue outlook. While the rapid increase in fuel prices puts downward pressure on our earnings in the near-term, we have the right plan in place to address the challenge that we expect to return to margin expansion by year-end. We have solid revenue momentum and improving cost trajectory and we will take 50 to 100 basis points of underperforming capacity out of our full schedules. We are continuing to look for opportunities to reduce marginal flying in a higher fuel environment. With a strong financial foundation in place, we expect to deliver a fourth consecutive year of pretax earnings above $5 billion, a result largely in line with last year despite the significant fuel headwind. This shows that the plan we laid out at Investor Day is working and positions us well to succeed in today's fuel and revenue environment. First, we are seeing outstanding results in growing our topline. Our record June quarter shows solid revenue performance across the business. We also have the most diverse revenue stream in the industry with contributions from our MRO, cargo, loyalty program and our joint ventures. During the June quarter, we saw four new top 10 revenue days and that momentum is continuing in the September quarter with a new top five day last Sunday. We are raising our full year revenue guide to 7% to 8%, reflecting strong demand, pricing momentum and record unit revenue premiums. Next, we are changing our cost trajectory. For the June quarter, unit cost growth rates are down sequentially for the third consecutive quarter. This trend is expected to continue in the second half of the year getting us back into our target range of less than 2% annual growth for 2018 and beyond. Since the merger, we have grown non-fuel unit cost at a rate below inflation while investing significantly in our people, customer experience, operation, fleet and products. And finally, we are continuing to invest in our international franchise. Through our growth and joint ventures, we are building a best-in-class global network for our customers. In 2018, we expect to drive $100 million in incremental value from all these relationships with even greater upside to come. Delta has the right combination of strategic advantages to be successful in any environment. Our culture, leading operational reliability and unrivaled network, loyalty programs, including our relationship with American Express and an investment grade balance sheet, this powerful combination sets the stage for continued success and consistent earnings growth. Our strong foundation underpins the Board's decision to increase our dividend for the fifth year in a row. Beginning in the September quarter, our dividend will increase by 15% to $0.35 per share. This increase demonstrates our conviction in the durability and sustainability of the Delta business model. At yesterday's closing price, this represents a nearly 3% yield. In closing, while higher fuel prices are pressuring near-term results, we remain on track to deliver a solid year. Offsetting the $2 billion cost increase to deliver a pretax results this year that's largely in line with 2015. And as we look forward to 2019, we are confident in our ability to drive long-term value for our owners through topline growth, margin expansion and prudent deployment of capital. Before turning the call over to Glen, I would like to take a minute to congratulate Gary Chase on his new role as Chief Strategy Officer. Gary has been a key part of our team since joining Delta in 2012, including leading our One Delta initiative. We are excited that he will now shift his focus to the formation and execution of our strategy, helping position Delta to keep climbing. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Glen and Paul to go through the details of the quarter. Glen Hauenstein : Thanks Ed and good morning everyone. First I would like to thank the entire Delta team for the great service they provide customers each and every day, enable us to generate record revenues of $11.6 billion in the June quarter. These results were driven by a continuation of strong demand coupled with yield momentum that built throughout the quarter. We also experienced significant gains in cargo, loyalty and branded fares all contributing to nearly $1 billion of topline revenue growth. This produced a 4.6% improvement in total unit revenues year-over-year at the high-end of our initial guidance for the quarter. Corporate revenues grew 10% and were our highest quarterly corporate revenues ever. There were increases across all entities and across all industry sectors. Our corporate demand outlook remains strong. In our most recent survey, 84% of corporate travel managers expected to maintain or increase their travel spend in the third quarter. Improving corporate yields remains a significant opportunity and focus. While we are pleased with the June second quarter revenue results, as of June we have only recovered 20% of the decline in domestic corporate fares since our peak in 2014. While we saw sequential improvement in corporate yields within each of the three months in the second quarter, we still see great opportunity and momentum as we continue to work every day to recapture the cost of higher fuel through further yield improvements. In the June quarter, cargo and loyalty revenues both grew by double digits. Our close relationship with American Express is a true source of competitive advantage. In the quarter, we drove an incremental $120 million in value and we are on pace to deliver $3.4 billion in total for 2018, up from our initial prediction of $3.3 billion. Direct digital channels experienced their best quarter on record with direct sales up 13% year-on-year. We recently launched the newest version of delta.com and the Delta mobile app. These new products are producing record revenues as well as record satisfaction numbers as we continue to bring industry-leading products and services to market through our digital applications. Focusing on fuel, there has been a substantial run-up in market prices since this time last year. There have been two sharp legs-up, one in late last year and one more recent in late spring. Given the industry's historical fuel recapture lag, we have fully recaptured the first leg in fuel run-up and are working hard to realize the second leg as quickly as possible. Strong core demand, recent industry momentum as well as programmatic international industry fuel surcharges, which kick in over the next quarter give us confidence that we will successfully recapture the most recent leg of the fuel run-up during the second half of 2018. While we have reduced our fall capacity plans by 50 to 100 basis points, work is ongoing and we will continue to adjust capacity in markets which we are not able to pass along higher fuel costs. We expect to see new unit revenue premium records in the June quarter. This is again a testament to the strength of the Delta brand as both our increases in stage length and gauge significantly outpaced the industry in the quarter. Turning to our entity performance. Domestic revenues grew 8% on a 2.5% increase in yield and a load factor of 87%. Delta's top position give us a unique opportunity to continue to benefit from upgauging while maintaining the best revenue premium in the industry. 70% of our domestic growth this year is from higher gauge as we continue to retire our MD-88 and replace them with larger, more efficient 737-900s and A321. Over the next several years, our domestic fleet will receive further step function improvement as we delivered the new A220 aircraft and A320neo, which both replace older less efficient aircraft and provide best-in-class economics. Internationally, we experienced improving trends with unit revenues up 9% versus last year. This was led by strong demand in both leisure and business segments, coupled with growing revenues from the suite of products and services we have begun to sell internationally. This is the fourth consecutive quarter that international unit revenue growth has outpaced domestic. Transatlantic unit revenues increased 11% driven by very strong business cabin performance and robust leisure demand combined with a three point currency tailwind. We now offer a complete set of branded fares across the Atlantic and are working with our partners to provide a more seamless experience when flying Delta and our partners by aligning those products and services as closely as possible. Our Alliance team is building the largest and most profitable joint venture with our European partners Air France-KLM, Virgin Atlantic and Alitalia. We continue to rely more heavily on our partner's EU hubs and now deployed 60% of our transatlantic capacity into their hubs. We have successfully added routes like Los Angeles to Paris, Indianapolis to Paris, Orlando to Amsterdam, Los Angeles to Amsterdam into our portfolio of successful transatlantic markets. Unit revenues increased by 1% in Latin as this region faced the most headwinds during the quarter. Weak demand to Mexican beaches and currency devaluations were offset by strength in Central America and the Caribbean. We are reducing capacity to match demand in the impacted markets. Forward bookings into the Caribbean remain a bright spot as demand has rebounded more quickly than expected from last year's hurricanes. And with the most recent election now over and stabilizing of the peso, Mexico business markets are showing improvements in the back half of 2018. Our JV partnership with Aeromexico, which just celebrated a one-year anniversary, gives us a great platform for providing the best product for business and leisure travelers to and from Mexico. In the Pacific, our multiyear restructuring is delivering solid improvements in margins and we now provide the most efficient and comprehensive route network in the Pacific. An 8% increase in year-over-year stage length makes our 10% unit revenue growth even more impressive. We officially launched our joint venture with Korean Air in May marking a very significant milestone for us in the Pacific. In the June quarter, we experienced double-digit unit revenue growth in Korea on a 24% increase in year-over-year capacity. We are very pleased with a strong start to our joint venture and would like to thank our Pacific team and our partners at Korea for delivering such terrific results. We are committed to continuing to improve our products as well as our network footprint as we add A350s and reconfigure 777s with our four class products, including Delta One Suites, Premium Select and the industry's largest seats and coach our 777 fleet. Across all regions, segmentation initiatives are one of our largest commercial opportunities. During the quarter, domestic first-class and Comfort+ revenues grew almost 20% on an 8% increase in available premium seats. Looking forward, we will continue to grow our ability to offer customers upgraded experience as we add premium seats domestically with our fleet renewal program. We know these products are not yet mature and we are increasing the ways our customers will be able to purchase them. For example, since launching last May, post purchase upsells have generated over $200 million of revenues and now account for over 10% of all premium products. We continue to roll out more options that our customers are asking for, including the ability to paying with miles by the end of 2018. Delta Premium Select expanded into the transatlantic during the quarter and by 2021, all of our international widebodies will be equipped with this cabin, which is generating an average bare premium of over 100% to a standard coach seat. Our success in selling branded products, growth in our premium seats and enhanced future functionality give us confidence that we will deliver the $350 million of incremental revenues in our 2018 plan. And looking forward, we believe there will be significant continued growth and expect an additional $500 million in 2019. With momentum from fuel price recapture and our commercial initiatives, we expect top line growth of 8% for the September quarter with total unit revenue growth of 3.5% to 5.5% on 3% to 4% higher capacity. Importantly, baseline unit passenger revenue trends are showing improvements despite tougher comps and headwinds due to holiday timing. The trends we are seeing combined with the level of service that only Delta people can provide drive us to raise our full year revenue growth to 7% to 8% from our previous guide of about 4% to 6%. This will be Delta's highest topline revenue growth since 2011, a year in which we successfully recaptured a $3 billion increase in fuel. With that, I would like to turn it over to Paul. Paul Jacobson : Thank you Glen and good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. For the June quarter, total operating expenses increased 13%, or $1.1 billion with over half of the increase driven by higher fuel prices. With market fuel prices up 10% over the March quarter and 50% versus prior year, our fuel expense increased nearly $600 million for the quarter. For the September quarter, we expect our all-in fuel price to increase approximately 40% over last year to $2.32 to $2.37. At the current forward curve, year-over-year increases in fuel should moderate to about 20% in the December quarter. In the third quarter, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $1.65 to $1.85 per share which equates to a pretax margin of 12% to 14%, about two to three points behind last year's 15.6% results. With a strong revenue environment and a back drop of moderating fuel increases, improving our non-fuel unit cost trajectory will play a key role as we drive toward a return to margin expansion by the end of the year and in 2019. Non-fuel unit costs were up 2.9% for the June quarter, a one point step down from the March quarter. In the September quarter, we take a bigger step down and expect our non-fuel CASM to be flat year-over-year with the fourth quarter slightly better than that. As we have discussed since Investor Day, the second half of 2018 is an inflection point on CASM as overhead pressures moderate from categories like depreciation from our fleet retirements, investments made in the back half of 2017 related to our products and security enhancements and one-time benefits last year from the Republic bankruptcy emergence and other settlements which occurred in the first half. Unit cost in the back half of the year should be three to four points better than our first half performance. One to two points of that relief is driven by lapping these overhead pressures just mentioned, with the remainder of the improvement driven by a ramp in One Delta productivity and refleeting benefits. This puts us on a trajectory for 1% to 2% non-fuel unit cost growth for 2018. This is a solid result, albeit at the upper end of our original range due to a half point of pressure from weather and currency. Our One Delta project is progressing well and as we roll into the second half of the year, we will begin to see more benefits throughout the P&L, including in fuel. As an example, we recently launched a fuel initiative that focuses on auxiliary power unit usage to optimize how we power aircraft on the ground while also working on improving our load planning. The One Delta team has made good progress and remains focused on process improvements that create a short-term benefit, but more importantly build a foundation for Delta's long-term success. This fall, our network optimization efforts kick into high gear. This is one of our more substantial long-term opportunities where we are designing a new process to create and implement schedules, driving expected annual run rate savings of more than $300 million. Recently, we also identified opportunities in our supply chain in categories like maintenance components and IT hardware. Looking forward, One Delta initiatives combined with our fleet renewal and simplification should drive substantial efficiency gains over a multiyear period. With 30 aircrafts still to be delivered this year, refleeting will also drive significant seat cost improvements in our domestic hubs, which are the most profitable in the industry. Internationally, our new A350s and A330s will improve our Pacific profitability through increased fuel efficiency and better revenue performance from an industry-leading product. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $2.8 billion of operating cash flow for the quarter which allowed for reinvestment in the business through $1.4 billion in CapEx, with 1.2 billion of that related to aircraft and aircraft modifications. In the quarter, we generated $1.4 billion of free cash flow and returned $813 million to shareholders through $600 million in share repurchases and $213 million in dividends. Since announcing our strategy to consistently return cash to shareholders five years ago, we have reduced our fully diluted share count by 19% and have returned more than $11 billion through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining low debt levels and improving the funded status of our pension plans. We continue to buy back shares every day and are on pace to complete our current authorization in 2020. Our repurchase activity and dividend increase demonstrates our conviction on the durability and the sustainability of our business model. Harnessing our investment grade balance sheet, we completed $1.6 billion unsecured debt offering at a blended rate of 3.85% that was used to refinance secured debt and freed $8 billion in previously encumbered assets while lowering our annual interest expense by about $20 million. As part of these transactions, we also increased our undrawn revolver capacity by about $600 million to a total of $3.1 billion. We also, during the quarter, launched and closed a $1.4 billion tax-exempt bond offering to finance our LaGuardia project. By self financing this project we can maintain control of the construction and drive more certainty in our long-term cost structure and product. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet and our combined adjusted net debt and pension liability declined $600 million since the end of last quarter. In closing, we delivered solid earnings for the June quarter despite higher fuel costs. I want to add my thanks to the entire Delta team for their hard work and dedication in helping to produce these results. As we look forward, we are excited about our continued revenue momentum and improving cost trajectory. Irrespective of fuel, returning to margin expansion is a critical focus for this team. With that, I will turn the call back over to Jill to begin the Q&A. Jill Greer : Alan, we are ready for the analyst Q&A section, if you could give the instructions for how to get into the queue. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Jamie Baker : Good morning everybody. Paul, the $3 billion in AmEx contribution last year, can you tell us how you are tracking in 2018, but also how we should reconcile that on the income statement? How much is accounted for in revenue? How much is accounted for in reduced expenses? Just trying to understand how you define the term contribution? Paul Jacobson : Sure. As Glen mentioned in his comments, we are expecting $3.4 billion from our AmEx relationship this year, which is higher than our original expectation going into the year. The overwhelming majority of that appears in the other revenue line through both other revenue and then once the miles are redeemed for flying. There is some element of cost and we can walk you through separately on the detailed modeling exercise of that. Jamie Baker : That helps. Second question for Ed. This whole leap of faith and I know that's not your term, but you know we have said it different this time. It's not your grandfather's airline industry. You have spoken to the industry's structural changes. I think you and I are in agreement on this topic, but the economy is roaring, your stock's down 10% year-to-date, you are trading at a multiple that's no better than when the industry was basically a joke, you are essentially getting zero credit for what you have accomplished. I mean I think the sell side has done a pretty good job at pointing out what's better, the rating agencies get it, marks investors, the credit market gets it, look at your debt costs. So my question is, what is still broken here? And please don't tell me that we have to pass the recessionary test in order for multiples to rise because that just means there is no reason to own the stock today. So I promise there is a question here. What is still broken? What does Delta or the industry in general still need to tackle in order to get its message through to the equity market? Ed Bastian : Well, Jamie, you expressed a frustration I think many of us in this room and throughout the industry feel. Fundamentally, we believe in the thesis we need to continue to perform. I agree that I don't think we need to go through hard times to demonstrate that this model works. All you have to go back is through the hard times in 2009 at the bottom of the recession, ex a bad fuel hedge decision, Delta would have been profitable in 2009. And if you model us today, in any reasonable economic downturn, we are, I think, talking significantly profitable going forward. So we are going to continue to produce. We are going to continue to point investors to where the opportunities are. Certainly fuel prices have been weighing on the stock. One of the things, I think, is most important that we get back to margin expansion. When you think about the margins in this industry, they have declined now three years in a row. We need to stop that. We need to grow the margin and I am hoping, certainly by year-end, that we are starting to grow margins again and hopefully, with a little luck, maybe even in Q4. Jamie Baker : All right. I appreciate the comments. I will turn the microphone back to others for all the RASM and CASM questions. Thanks guys. Operator : All right. Next, we go to Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi Syth : Hi. Good morning. I guess I will ask the RASM question. Just on the international side, I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color on what you think the transatlantic, especially dies FX start to be less of a tailwind? And also, does Air France-KLM strikes have any kind of beneficial impact there in the first half and maybe not as much in the second half? Ed Bastian : We see very robust demand and continued strength into the third quarter and the early results for fall, as you know, transatlantic tends to book sooner than domestic. So we have a little bit more visibility into what we are seeing in the third quarter and beyond. And we feel really comfortable and this is a very, very strong environment for the transatlantic. Savi Syth : So then what's driving that? Is it strong economy? Or any kind of thoughts on that? Ed Bastian : Business traffic, some things that are a little less obviously, I think, is we hear a lot about Brexit and we see all the rhetoric about Brexit, but business traffic to and from the U.K. on Delta and our partners is at record levels. Similarly in Continental Europe, we are seeing record revenues in terms of yields and in terms of traffic into Continental Europe. So it is a relatively robust business environment and very, very strong leisure demand. And I think when you think of how fuel weighs on the ultra low cost carriers in that marketplace, it tends to have more of an impact on them and their raising fares has translated into our ability to get higher fares for not only business but for leisure as well. Savi Syth : Thanks. And if I might ask just a follow-up on the capacity comment? I know you have talked about adjusting capacity in the markets where you can pass through the higher fuel costs. But as you look at your position in the second half and beyond, are there markets where you are actually seeing stronger than expected results and maybe an opportunity to increase capacity in some of the entities? Ed Bastian : I think that's what we do every day here is, try and figure out where we want to position the airline's capacity and try and continue to optimize it. And we are working very hard. And I think the result in the second quarter saw again a step function improvement versus the general industry and our ability to go ahead and do that and that's a testament to the entire commercial team here at Delta who takes the great product that our people produce every day and takes the demand set for that and then tries continuingly to reoptimize it. And I think if you look at long-term trends, this will be yet another record for our system unit revenues versus the industry. Savi Syth : All right. Thank you. Operator : Next, we go to Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : Hi. Thank you. Good morning. How do you calculate that two-thirds of fuel being passed through? I am curious because you mentioned in the context of how you think about capacity planning and I would love to be able to replicate that in my model simplistically if I am able to do it. Paul Jacobson : Sure. Good morning Hunter, it's Paul. What we do is, we basically take all the revenue growth, subtract out the cost and then cover the difference in pretax margin as a function of what the fuel price is. So if you look at that, our pretax was down slightly under $200 million for the quarter on $600 million of fuel pressure. Hunter Keay : Okay. Great. Thank you. And then with the caveat that this is not necessarily a comment on capacity guidance for next year, how are you thinking about net changes to the fleet count or even better on a seat count basis in 2019? Ed Bastian : Hunter, we haven't given the 2019 guidance. We are not going to give it on this call, as you can appreciate. I think our fleet is expected to grow by about 80 aircraft next year. In total the gross new aircraft we are taking, most of those will be replacement aircraft. But we haven't decided what the net growth position of the airline will be. Hunter Keay : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We will go now to Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Andrew Didora : Hi. Good morning everyone. I guess Glen, just wanted to touch upon your total revenue growth number share. Coming to the years, you said that you didn't really expect much deviation in quarterly RASM. Now with your 3Q guide, first half results, this has really been true. I think total revenue growth has been around 9.5%, but fuel has obviously moved here. So I would have thought things should be getting better but that's not really what your 4Q revenue guide would imply. Given your total revenue growth number for the year, it now goes down to 7% to 8%. And I know there are tough comps out there, but can you maybe walk us through any headwinds that you see as we get later into the year? Or is your total revenue growth outlook really more a function of having shut down the refinery for most of 4Q? Thanks. Glen Hauenstein : I will turn that over to Paul here. Paul Jacobson : Yes. So Andrew, thanks for that. As we have talked about going back through Investor Day, we do expect that the refinery will be shut down in 4Q for its systematic turnaround effort. So that's a bigger drain on 4Q that is a disproportionate step down from what we have seen for the rest of the year. Andrew Didora : Got it. Okay. So just in terms of everything else in the business, it seems like pretty, when I back that out, it seems like pretty steady growth is still anticipated? Glen Hauenstein : Yes. We are seeing very good momentum on the passenger revenue line item. And I think we are anticipating that to continue in the third and fourth quarters. Andrew Didora : Okay. That clarity is helpful. Thank you. Operator : Next, we go to Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Michael Linenberg : Yes. Two quick ones here. Just on the refinery in the quarter, Paul. I don't know if it was in the press release. Do you have what the P&L was on that? Paul Jacobson : Yes. It was about a $40 million benefit for the quarter. Michael Linenberg : Okay. Great. And then just to Glen. Glen, you talked about third quarter RASM outlook. I mean it sequentially looks better than June. And then you talked about the fact that there are some headwinds. I think you said holiday shift, maybe difficult comps. Is the holiday shift, is that Labor Day or July 4? And what about the storm impact? Was that a benefit? Or how do we think about those? Glen Hauenstein : So there are a of ins and outs in the quarter as they are always are. The holiday we are referring to is the shift of the Jewish holidays from a weekend day in October timeframe to a weekday in September. Michael Linenberg : Okay. Glen Hauenstein : And that's actually a pretty big number, when you think about the quarter shifting and actually going from a weekend to a weekday ruins a whole week of business travel for a sector of our business travelers. So that is impacted, also the storms as we said last year, were one point favorable impact and then we have a difference in the PRASM to TRASM which has been negative in the third quarter, which was a positive in the second quarter. Michael Linenberg : Okay. Great. All right. Thank you. Glen Hauenstein : I want to just reiterate that the passenger revenue momentum that we saw accelerating into the second quarter is continuing into the third quarter. Michael Linenberg : Okay. Great. Thanks Glen. Operator : Next, we go to Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Brandon Oglenski : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I guess Ed or Glen, I mean, back to Jamie's first question here, should investors just expect that we are going to have a lot of earnings volatility in any up economy, because when we go back historically, usually oil prices move with economy. So how do you think about is going forward? What are some proactive measures you can make to maybe temper out some of that fuel driven earnings volatility? Ed Bastian : Well, Brandon, I can't speak to the industry at large. I can only speak to Delta. What we are trying to do is deliver a premium product that customers prefer. It's driving our net promoter scores. It's driving an outperformance within the industry. It's top line, not just growth for growth sake, but growth for premium sake as well. And get back to margin stabilization and expansion. The fuel price volatility has certainly been somewhat dysfunctional within the industry over the last several years. We have all talked about that and fuel prices where they are today at roughly $75 brent does not scare. I think that's actually a good stable place that we can platform from to continue the growth to get back to growing more margins. So I think that's what the industry needs to do. Brandon Oglenski : Okay. I appreciate that. And Paul, can you remind us on the One Delta initiatives what your long-term CASM guidance is? I think you did provide that through 2020? And I think you said $1 billion of non-fuel costs that you are looking to save by that time period. Does that also include the fleet renewals that we are looking at? Paul Jacobson : No. So Brandon, thanks for that question. The One Delta initiative stand on its own and it's all about improving processes and really an enterprisewide project for just performing better and more efficiently. That is over and above the fleet efficiency. So what we have said is, $1 billion from that program building over the next few years will keep us below 2% unit cost inflation and help us to drive towards the continued goals for the long-term. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Operator : Next, we will go to Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hi. Thanks. As you watch how the rest of the industry has implemented basic economy so far, have you detected any positive share gain versus some of the more punitive implementations of it, no carry-on, et cetera? Any sense the customers really don't like it? Glen Hauenstein : Those are not a very, very difficult things to isolate and I think you know what we look at is our relative revenue performance in aggregate and are we supplying the right products and services that people want to buy from us and I think as the quarter unfolds over the next couple weeks here, as everybody announces the details of their earnings, you will see that we, I think, took another step function improvement in aggregate and produced the highest level of revenue premiums we have in our history. So it's very hard to isolate which individual piece contributed to the whole brand impact, but I think that's certainly a contributing factor. Ed Bastian : Part of that, Duane, also is the net promoter scores that we see and mentioned our domestic net promoter scores were up three points year-over-year, which is huge when you measure net promoter scores to drive an improvement at an already good base of further improvement. So clearly, customers of all classes are preferring Delta in increasing numbers. Duane Pfennigwerth : That's helpful. And then Glen, I always appreciate the reminder on how much you recovered in corporate fares and how much potential is out there. I wonder if you could offer a view on short headroom by geographic region, which geographic entity do you think has the most upside potential? Thanks for taking the questions. Glen Hauenstein : Well, I think we are most focused on domestic, right. The domestic is where we really need to get those fares moving. They have moved internationally. And we are continuing to focus on that everyday. We see great opportunity and that's what gives us really good confidence as we move through the rest of the year that we will be able to hit the margin expansion by year-end. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thank you. Operator : And next, we will go to Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Rajeev Lalwani : Hi. Good morning gentlemen. Ed Bastian : Good morning. Rajeev Lalwani : Ed, in terms of the capacity outlook, can you just reconcile the full year guide going to the to the top end of the range, but then also highlighting 50 to 100 bips or so of trimming in the fall schedule? Ed Bastian : Well, I will let the Paul and Jill provide some of the details, reconciliation of the numbers. Part of the increase is the higher completion factor that we are running above plan. That's a meaningful part of it. But the other thing to think about when you are looking at our overall 3% capacity, that's entirely gauge and stage related. Departures actually are down for the full year. Our expectations are departures count will be down and when you are thinking within the industry, I think we are the only major, maybe the only airline out there that's got departures down. But I think we are being very prudent as to how we are thinking about capacity. We are certainly outperforming the industry on revenue production and revenue productivity and we also know that we have got big non-fuel CASM reduction plan that we are working heavily on and fleet is a big part of that too. Rajeev Lalwani : Got it. Thanks. And Glen, a network question for you. Can just talk about how you go about evaluating whether or not to take away a flight or even add a flight? Is it looking at margins? Or is it just simply, hey, if a route is profitable, there is no reason to cut it? Glen Hauenstein : Well, I have a dart board in my office. We have teams that comb through the day-in and day-out and we have really the best teams in the industry. I am really so proud of them and they are every day working to optimize our capacity and press the envelope in terms of trying to raise the yield. So this is a great process that we have in place and one, I think, that's proven Delta as at the top of the industry, year after year in producing these returns. And I would love to say it's me, but it's not. It's a team of hundreds of professionals every day that are working to make this happen for us and they do a great job at it. Rajeev Lalwani : Right. So maybe the other way to ask the question is, if you have got, say, a flight out there and it's barely profitable, do you say, hey look, that's additive to EPS. We should keep it there? Or is it sort of, hey it's not really reaching a return threshold, it's time to go kind of a thing? Glen Hauenstein : I think that highly oversimplifies the process that you look at a flight plate. It's clearly in terms of the competitive dynamics of that and what your expectations are for that individual flight. And of course, when you look at the flight level details, what time of day is it, what's the opportunity cost for that flight. So it's a very complicated transaction. I think we are oversimplifying it by trying to put it in boxes like that. It's a much more complicated and rigorous and happy to spend a day down here sometime, if you want to come down and look how we do it, because I think it's a really interesting feature. Rajeev Lalwani : Very helpful, as always, guys. Thank you. Operator : Next, we will go to Helane Becker with Cowen and Company. Helane Becker : Thanks very much operator. Hi guys. Thank you very much for taking the question. So I think you mentioned that, for an example, you were adding Indianapolis to Europe service. Is that a connection? Is it really about connecting Indianapolis traffic with other points in Europe as opposed to point-to-point and instead of over hubs in New York and Detroit? And B, should we think about opportunity for you in that small or medium size city to Amsterdam and Paris and to some extent London going forward? Glen Hauenstein : Helane, a great question and I think that really is the point is that when we fly from Indianapolis to Paris, we are not just flying from Indy to Paris, we are flying from Indianapolis to Paris connecting to all of Europe and then really connecting Asia and Africa through Paris. So we would never contemplate flying from Indianapolis to Paris if it were two endpoints on our network, but really given the strength of the frequent flyer base and the loyalty we have in Indianapolis and the amount of traffic that's continuing on to those destinations beyond Paris, that's where we have really added over the past years, using our partner hubs. Really exciting for the results too. Indianapolis to Paris is doing quite well in its first year of operation. We also added Orlando to Amsterdam. That's also doing quite well. And Los Angeles to both Paris and Amsterdam. Interesting factoid is, of the three major U.S. carriers in Los Angeles, we were the only one that did not have nonstop European service on our own metal. So we added that this year and that's doing really well as well. Helane Becker : Is that designed to prepare the airline and your partners in case there is no EU-U.K. or U.K.-U.S. agreement after March 29? Glen Hauenstein : We haven't really done that with that in mind, but I think we don't connect a lot of traffic in Heathrow, because we have a great partner that has the number two position in the U.K. But it's really not a hub connecting complex. They have a few connections, but it's not the size and scale and scope of Paris or Amsterdam, which are two of the largest connecting complex is in all of Europe. Helane Becker : Got you. Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate the answers. Operator : Next, we will go to Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Dan McKenzie : Hi. Good morning. Thanks guys. Glen, the stat in the script that stood out to me is an 8% increase in premium seats that drove a 20% increase in upsell revenue. Please correct my math here, but it sounds like premium products in total are driving roughly $2 billion annually. And I am just wondering if we should interpret this segment of the business as growing double digits? Or maybe if you could just clarify and help us understand how to think about the sustainability of the premium suite of products that you are selling today? Glen Hauenstein : Dan, this is really something we continue to remain excited about and excited about our future. As we continue to drive brand loyalty and to drive better customer segmentation, we have seen continued strength here. And when you add 8% in capacity and you far outpace that in terms of revenue growth, we think that's just another factoid in, hey people really want to buy that from us. So our fleet sets up nicely in the next few years to continue to expand those number of seats and then we are taking some changes to the fleet. For example, adding the Premium Select into all of our international widebody fleet, which is a really a new announcement that we made in this call that will all be complete by 2021 because people want to buy these products and services from us. And quite honestly, we haven't made it that easy for them. And over the next months and years, we are going to make it easier and easier with more and more ways to buy these products and services and we see that as a real growth opportunity. Dan McKenzie : Very good. And then just a second question here. We got a better revenue outlook this morning, despite greater macro volatility and so the revenue outlook is a little better than I would have anticipated. And the industry has cited, escalating trade war as a risk to revenue. And I am just wondering how you guys are thinking about it? What you are seeing today? How that's factored into your revenue outlook, if at all, as we look out through the end of the year here? Ed Bastian : Dan, this is Ed. We are not seeing any signs that the rumors escalating trade wars are impacting business travel or travel in general. We just posted our highest quarter in history. Our total topline is up 10%. I think the increased outlook, as you say, we gave for revenue is through the help of the international as well as the domestic economies and also the fact that we need to cover the higher price of fuel in our ticket price. So who knows where the saying goes, but we are not seeing any negative impacts from it. Dan McKenzie : Perfect. Thanks Ed. Operator : Next, we will go to Kevin Crissey with Citi. Kevin Crissey : Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Maybe a question for Glen. Your Q2 domestic yield is up 2.5%. That's inclusive of your domestic portion of international itineraries, I assume. Can you talk about what that might look like if we just looked at a domestic origin to a domestic destination? And if you don't have that handy, maybe you could just talk about maybe the situation in ULCC competitive markets? That's what I am getting at there. Thanks. Glen Hauenstein : Well, domestic portion of international journey is not going to have a significant impact on that number. And ULCC traction has been very strong. We have seen a lot of strength in leisure in ULCC competitive markets. When you think about the business model at a more macro level, clearly higher fuel has much more impacted them in terms of trying to drive leisure traffic that might not otherwise fly. So I think we have seen some very good traction in those markets. Kevin Crissey : If I could just follow-up on that. Given the strength of the international franchise and the yields are putting up there and the overall average fares, why wouldn't the allocation of that to the domestic market be impactful? I am not sure I understand that. Glen Hauenstein : Because the number of passengers, while the revenues are 40%, the number of passengers because of the higher ticket volumes, it doesn't drive a whole lot of travel on the domestic portion and the pro rata relatively low to begin with. So that's not going to drive a whole lot. And we can happily walk you through that math. I mean, it could be a few tenths of a point, but it's not going to be significant. Kevin Crissey : Terrific. Thank you. Jill Greer : And Alan, we are going to have time for one more question from the analysts. Operator : Okay. We will take that last question from Susan Donofrio with Macquarie. Susan Donofrio : Yes. Good morning everybody. Just a quick question. So is there, I think following up with Jamie and Brandon's question and trying to think through how to perhaps help mitigate earnings volatility, you guys own your own refinery, as you know and certainly domestically that helps, would you consider, I guess, hedging more internationally? Or is there anything else you could do when you look at some of the drivers that perhaps could help placate investors a little more? Ed Bastian : Susan, what do you mean by hedging internationally? Susan Donofrio : Well, I was thinking more just on the fuel side, if there is more FX currency or just anything you could perhaps put a little more in your numbers? Ed Bastian : We are not thinking of doing anything like that, Susan, no. Susan Donofrio : You are not. Okay. And then just a follow-up domestically. Can you broadly give us maybe more of a sense of pockets of strength and weaknesses? Is it more in the low-fare airline overlap? Just a little more color, I think would be helpful. Ed Bastian : I think what we have seen as we seen really robust business travel in terms of volumes. The yields have been weaker than we would have liked or anticipated given the robust levels of demand. And so that's the piece that we are working on every day to try and improve. And leisure travel, so all of the events, as when you look out are very strong in terms of both yield and traffic. So we have the flush of consumer continues and that consumers want experiences and travel fits well into that experiential model. So we see robust demand there and we see really, really strong demand for business in terms of volumes and now we continue to need to work on improving the yields. Susan Donofrio : Great. I will end with that. Thank you very much. Jill Greer : That's going to wrap up the analyst portion of the call. I will hand it over to our Chief Communications Officer, Ned Walker. Ned Walker.: Hi. Thanks Jill. We will go ahead and begin the media Q&A now. First I would like to ask the media to limit themselves to one question with a quick follow-up. That should allow us to accommodate almost everyone. And Alan, if you could please review the process to queue up to ask a question, that would be helpful. Please go ahead. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We take our first question from Alison Sider with The Wall Street Journal. Alison Sider : Hi. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just sort of curios, looking out, at what point do you start to see higher fares starting to discourage passengers and dampen demand? Ed Bastian : Hi. this is Ed. We are not seeing anything other than strong demand for our products. Pricing is certainly a function of cost and with higher fuel prices, you are going to expect to see ticket prices go up as well our pricing currently is up about 4% on a year-over-year basis. So I think it's at a good level, but best revenue performance in our history this quarter and our outlook is strong. Alison Sider : Thanks. Ned Walker.: Okay. Next question. Operator : Next, we will go to Leslie Josephs with CNBC. Leslie Josephs : Hi. Good morning guys. On the premium economy, are you seeing a lot of corporate travelers take those fares and is that cannibalizing from the more expensive business fares? And then also on the international growth, how much of that is on your own metal? And does that help you or hurt you, how it's broken up with your JVs? Thanks. Ed Bastian : So we have seen robust demand for our Delta One product, especially in the Pacific as we have introduced Premium Select into over 50% of the market now, we have seen no real degradation in terms of the demand for the premium products and services, the most premium. And what we have seen is really consumer discretionary and corporations that have travel policy that only allow for coach really using that extensible. And as we continue to roll out different ways to buy those products, we will see I think another explosion in demand as other customers will use their miles to sit in the cabins they want. And I think bringing that ability of our frequent flyers to choose where they want to sit after they buy the ticket is really going to be something that's going to generate a lot of great products and services for customers as well as revenue for the airline. Leslie Josephs : And on the international growth, how much of that is your own flying versus your JVs or cochairs or another partnerships? Ed Bastian : So generally, we stay balanced with our partner so that all of our joint ventures are based on a 50-50 growth pattern. And so over the long-term on any individual season or month, it might be a little bit weighed to one or the other, but over the long term, it's based on growing at the same rates. So a lot of that's our own metal and a lot of it's partner related. Leslie Josephs : Okay. And is there any number on the upsell between economy and premium economy or economy and Comfort Plus? I think you guys were like 50% last year upsell? Ed Bastian : Sorry. Could you repeat that question? Leslie Josephs : What's the upsell from economy to Comfort Plus domestically or economy to Premium Select? I think it was like 50% or 60% last year.. Has that grown? Ed Bastian : So the average fare differential from main cabin to Comfort Plus is between $25 and $35 domestically on average. So very nominal fees to get a really, I think, a great product value. And then internationally, which is the only place we have Premium Select, it's about 100% fare premium differential in the markets. Right now, it's mostly in the Pacific. So that's several hundred dollars more but we will be rolling it out to the transatlantic where we actually started but it's really only on one flight right now. But it will be ubiquitous in our long-haul network over the next several years. Leslie Josephs : And the upsell from the customers that are looking at regular economy versus buying up to something more expensive? Ed Bastian : Regular economy. Internationally? Leslie Josephs : That or both? Ed Bastian : Well, domestically it's about $35 for Comfort Plus. We won't have Premium Select in domestic. And then internationally, it's about $50 to $100 depending on the market to go from main cabin to Comfort Plus on the long-haul. And it's about several hundred dollars to move into Premium Select. Ned Walker.: Okay. We will take the next question now. Operator : Next, we will go to Edward Russell with Flightglobal. Edward Russell : Hi there. Thank you for taking my question. There has been some recent reports out of Austin about Delta having interest in potentially building a focus city there in the future, especially as the C-Series start to come in, sorry the A220s? Could you comment on this report and Delta's ambitions in Austin? Ed Bastian : Ed, we are not going to comment on any future plans that haven't already been announced. Edward Russell : Okay. Understood. And then a follow-up. Could you comment on how many A220s you expect to take delivery of this year and when those deliveries will begin? Ed Bastian : So you mean the 220s? Edward Russell : Yes, A220s. Ed Bastian : We expect to take delivery of a handful by the end of the year and we will be putting them into service in the first quarter. Edward Russell : Okay. So still no set date or number yet? Ed Bastian : It will be the beginning of the year. Ned Walker.: Okay. Alan, we have time for one more question. Operator : All right. We will take that last question from Dan Reed with Forbes. Ed Bastian : Hi. Dan, we cannot hear you. Dan Reed : I am sorry. Can you hear me now? Okay. Ed, at the risk of -- hello? Ed Bastian : Yes. We are having trouble. Sorry, but ask the question again, Dan. Dan Reed : Okay. At the risk of asking you to practice as a psychoanalyst, let me ask you a question that Jamie Baker asked in a different way. Why do you think investors are hesitant to bid up Delta's stock price principally, but also some of the other industry player's stock prices? Why are they being so hesitant to go where you think they should go? Ed Bastian : You certainly should get that feedback from the investors directly themselves. We are doing our very best. The Delta stock price is roughly adding American and United's market cap combined, that's what the Delta price is. So we do think we get a premium. And from a performance perspective, we can just control what we control which is delivering an outstanding value for our consumers, great product, reliability, with the best service and hospitality from our employees that's driving the higher customer satisfaction that we have ever seen and the highest revenue growth rate. I think one of the things that's been weighing on the stock, as we all know, is the growth in fuel prices in the short term and we have said on the call that we expect to be able to cover most if not all of it this year by the end of the year and set the pace for margin expansion going into 2019. Ned Walker.: Okay. Thank you very much, Ed, Glen, Paul and Joe. That concludes the June quarter 2018 call. Thanks everyone and have a good day. Operator : Again, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation today.",

My name is Lisa, and I will be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jill Greer : Thanks, Lisa. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on our September quarter call. Joining us from Atlanta today are our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Paul Jacobson. The entire leadership team is here in the room for the Q&A session. Ed will open the call and give an overview of Delta's financial performance, Glen will then address the revenue environment, and Paul will conclude with a review of our cost performance and cash flow. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted and you can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ed. Edward Bastian : Well, thanks, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Earlier, we reported a $1.6 billion pretax profit in the September quarter and earnings per share of $1.80, which was at the high-end of our initial guidance. Our EPS was up 16% over last year driven by strong revenue momentum, tax reform benefits, and a 4% lower share count. Demand for the Delta product has never been greater. Our revenues grew 8% to nearly $12 billion, a record level for the Company and now we expect to achieve 8% topline growth for the full-year. We have seen continued success in addressing fuel cost increases and offset roughly 85% of the $655 million impact of fuel cost for the quarter. Our speed in recovering these costs has never been better and gives us confidence that we can fully recapture fuel costs at these levels as we head into 2019 and start to grow our margins once more. I'd like to thank the Delta people for running the best airline operation and continuing to raise the bar. We've now had 100 days without a single cancellation across the entire Delta system, both Delta Mainline and Delta Connection, already exceeding 2017's full-year record of 90 days. I'd also like to thank the team for the incredible job they've done with the difficult and challenging conditions of Hurricane Michael. We've had less than 100 cancellations over the last two days with minimal financial impact. We are the last operator out of the Gulf Coast stations and we\u2019re the first carrier to return to these stations today. Our customers depend on Delta and we put our customers' needs and interests first. That's the Delta difference. This unprecedented level of reliability combined with great service from our team that is driving our customer satisfaction scores to new heights. Our domestic net promoter score has averaged 44% this year, which is up three points over the prior year. This is the reason why our revenue per premium is at record levels and sustainable. In recognition of our employees' outstanding performance, we've added another $395 million toward next February's profit sharing payout. This is in addition to awarding a 3% base increase, which was effective October 1, for ground employees and flight attendants. Later this month, we'll celebrate the 10th anniversary of our merger with Northwest, which was the beginning of the campaign to become the very best airline in the world for our employees, owners, and the customers and communities that we serve. In those 10 years, we've led an unprecedented transformation at Delta and our industry. We are financially stronger and able to withstand industry cycles like never before. We have increased our global reach to 52 countries with an innovative strategy that includes over $2 billion in equity ownership of our airline partners. Through our commercial efforts, we have taken Delta from mid-teens NPS and a revenue deficit to the industry to a carrier with leading customer satisfaction and a sustainable revenue premium. And through it all, we've shared that success with our people and at the same time, achieved an investment-grade rating and returned nearly $12 billion to our owners through dividends and share repurchases. Despite three significant upward moves in fuel this year, driving more than $2 billion of higher fuel expense, we still expect to deliver our fourth consecutive year of pretax profits over $5 billion. This demonstrates the resiliency of our business model and the speed with which we are able to react to changing economic conditions. Even with oil now hovering above $80 per barrel, we are confident that we have the momentum to return to margin expansion in 2019. We are never satisfied. We continue to set ambitious goals to improve the business and expand our profitability. We believe that Delta will sustain solid profits, margins, and cash flows throughout the business cycle. While still in the planning stages for 2019, we expect domestic capacity growth next year will decelerate by at least a point, partially offset by additional long-haul flying as we leverage our Korean joint venture. At a system level, we are building a plan for growth next year in the 3% range, which represents seat growth of about 2%, which is below expected GDP output and a point from greater stage length. While this is our current assumption, we'll be monitoring fuel and our ability to recapture these higher price points to ensure that 2019 is a year of margin growth. That is our top financial priority and is a business imperative. We'll be ready to act if we see sustained higher fuel prices or economic uncertainty impacting our return to margin expansion. In closing, we remain on track to deliver a very strong 2018. A $5 billion profit year, which is very similar to last year's results despite covering a $2 billion fuel cost increase. Our brand has never been healthier and the service from our team never greater. As we look forward to 2019, we are confident in our ability to drive long-term value for our owners through topline growth, margin expansion, and prudent deployment of our capital. I look forward to sharing more details on our strategic outlook and 2019 business plan at our upcoming Investor Day in December as we lay the foundation for another decade of success. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Glen and Paul to go through the fine details of the quarter. Glen Hauenstein : Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking the Delta team for delivering another record revenue quarter. The revenue environment is strong with solid demand in both leisure and business and a healthy yield environment. We had our busiest summer ever as record numbers of customers chose Delta for our industry-leading service and reliability. This generated record revenues of nearly $12 billion in the quarter, up 8% over last year. As a result, unit revenues grew by 4.3% as foreign exchange benefit of approximately one-half point was offset by the impact of Hurricane Florence. Storms are normally RASM accretive because flight cancellations drive ASM reductions. However, our in-house meteorology team and our OCC did a great job predicting the storm's path would avoid Atlanta and we were able to limit flight cancellations for our customers. We are maintaining our revenue momentum delivering a consistent mid-single digit unit revenue growth on a year-over-year and year-over-two-year basis despite much more challenging comps. Importantly, the rate of fuel recapture has sequentially improved each quarter this year and we are sustaining record revenue premium of 110% or higher to the industry. This speaks to the strength of the Delta brand and the quality of our services as our increases in both stage length and gauge significantly outpaced the industry in the quarter. We continue to grow the proportion of more stable and more profitable revenue, which is growing at a pace faster than ticket prices. Cargo, loyalty program, and MRO revenue were up double digits for the third consecutive quarter. This revenue momentum combined with better cost performance positions Delta to be among the first in the industry to expand margins despite the significant fuel price increases. Corporate travel is a major part of this momentum. Our total corporate revenues grew 12% for the quarter on close-in booking strength and business yield improvements. September finished as our strongest month of fare recovery this year and for the quarter; we have now recovered nearly 40% of decline since 2014 with fares now back above the 2016 levels. September was the sixth consecutive month with month-over-month improvements in corporate fare growth, evidence that we are seeing acceleration in the corporate fare environment. And our most recent survey, 90% of travel managers expect to maintain or increase their travel spend into 2019 giving us continued optimism that this positive momentum will continue. Domestic revenues grew 9% on 3% higher unit revenues driven by improved yields. The pace of improvement picked up in August and September driving the best quarter of domestic PRASM growth since the third quarter of 2014. Our core hubs of Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Detroit delivered among the strongest performances. Domestic unit revenue growth improved sequentially by more than one point despite the headwind from travel avoidance in the Southeast as Hurricane Florence approached. Looking forward, we see the continued momentum in close-in yields in the entity. Internationally, we saw improving trends with revenues up more than 6% on a 5% increase in unit revenues led by strong demand and robust revenue growth in our premium products. Our foreign exchange benefit stepped down from the June quarter as the dollar strengthened and we expect it to become a roughly 0.5 point headwind in the fourth quarter. Transatlantic unit revenues increased 8% driven by yield improvement and strong demand environment. Joint venture synergies and strong premium seat performance drove improvements above and beyond a 1.5 point FX benefit. In Latin, after eighth consecutive quarters of positive unit revenue, PRASM was down 3% driven by currency headwinds and political instability. We are making necessary adjustments by de-emphasizing capacities in weak markets to offset headwinds and return to unit revenue growth by early next year. In the Pacific, our unit revenues increased 5%. This is impressive performance given that our network changes drove an 11% increase in stage length. Japan and Korea, both produced double-digit RASM growth and our China routes delivered a 9% RASM improvement on an 18% increase in capacity. Delta's superior serviced and unmatched reliability drives our expectations for topline revenue growth of 8% in the December quarter on 3% to 5% unit revenue growth and 4% increase in capacity. While our full-year seat growth expected to be below GDP at 2.8% on flight departures, completion factor and stage length are expected to result in our full-year ASMs slightly ahead of our 3% guidance. The revenue environment is the best we've seen in years and the Delta brand has never been stronger. We believe we are seeing the strong commercial momentum needed to fully offset fuel prices at current levels. Longer-term we are using our network, our brand and customer experience, and segmentation initiatives to drive revenue growth and margin expansion. First on network, we are leveraging our domestic footprint and expanding our global capabilities. Our fleet evolution is focused on getting the right aircraft on the right routes. This will allow us to improve the customer experience, grow premium products while also benefiting our cost structure. Over the next five years, we expect our share of domestic seat departures in the most efficient narrowbody aircraft category will grow to 45%. No carrier has as much opportunity to benefit from upgauging as Delta over the next 5 years to 10 years. Internationally, the most significant change taking place is in the Pacific. In 2013 we laid out a vision of transforming our Pacific network. Since then, we have rationalized our footprint in Tokyo and Narita, developed U.S. gateways to the Pacific, replaced our 747 fleet with more efficient A350s, and enhanced our Transpacific alliances. With the building blocks now in place, we are seeing the expected improvements in profitability. Premium cabin performance has strengthened as our product has improved. With now 10 A350 aircraft deployed in the Pacific, we are encouraged by the revenue trends in our new Delta One suites and Premium Select cabins. Our joint venture with Korean is progressing well. Connecting traffic to Korea and beyond has more than doubled as we are building the best connecting complex in the Pacific. We will leverage this with our growth in the region next year. Second is strengthening our brand and improving customer experience. The quality of our product, service, and operational reliability combined with the breadth of our network drives higher customer loyalty and strengthens the Delta brand. Our commercial innovation has allowed us to deliver a differentiated high quality customer experience. This has resulted in more than a 20 point improvement in domestic net promoter score since the merger. This increasing customer affinity is reflected in record acquisitions of our co-brand American Express card, which is seeing double-digit; spend increases outpacing the U.S. card industry. Our loyalty program revenue has nearly tripled since the merger as more customers than ever see increasing value from using their SkyMiles American Express card. And finally, we are enabling customer choice through our segmentation initiatives. We are offering our customers more choices in best-in-class products that are increasingly easier to buy across all channels. We want all of our customers to be able to purchase Delta product how they want, when they want, and where they want. Premium product revenues grew 19% on a 3% increase in premium seats as upsell revenue continues to be a source of strength. We are excited to rollout additional functionality to allow post purchase mileage upgrades later this year. Our success in selling branded products, growing our premium seats, and enhancing future functionality gives us confidence that branded fares will deliver sustained contribution to improve revenue generation. In closing, it's been an incredibly eventful 10 years at Delta since the merger. Everyday, we think how we can make Delta better. We are giving our customers a high quality experience that they value and we will pay a premium for, improving that through innovation and service and continue to differentiate and expand on our commercial successes. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Paul. Paul Jacobson : Thank you, Glen, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I am pleased to say that the September quarter marked an important inflection point in our non-fuel cost trajectory. While non-fuel costs in the first half of the year were slightly higher than we expected, non-fuel unit costs were flat for the September quarter. This is a three point improvement from the June quarter and keeps us on track to deliver on our full-year guidance of 1% to 2% non-fuel unit cost growth. As we outlined at our Investor Day last December, getting our unit costs back in check has been a huge focus for the Company this year and I want to thank the entire Delta team for all the work it's taken to get here. In the December quarter, we expect our non-fuel CASM to be slightly better at flat to down 1%. As anticipated, overhead pressures such as depreciation have begun to moderate in the second half of 2018 and we've seen productivity benefits from our fleet changes and our One Delta initiatives. Our fleet transformation is still in the middle innings and will continue into the mid-2020s. As Glen mentioned, no carrier has as much opportunity to benefit from upgauging as Delta over the next five to 10 years. Airbus A320 deliveries start this quarter with entry into service in early 2019, primarily replacing high cost 50-seat regional jets, the aircraft least preferred by our customers. A321 and Boeing 737-900s are replacing the MD-88 fleet through 2020, providing a nearly 15% improvement in seat cost, while also upgauging the fleet with a much better product for our customers. Then beginning in 2020, we start the next phase in our journey as we replace our older narrowbodies with larger new engine technology A321s resulting in even greater efficiencies than the classics. Our One Delta initiative is founded on the idea that better cross-company collaboration drives better cost efficiency. It has been exciting to see the organization embrace this mindset as many of our large initiatives gain steam. One of our more substantial long-term opportunities is our network optimization initiative. This quarter, we opened a cross-divisional Schedule Coordination Center to provide a more holistic approach to our scheduling providing benefits to customers and employees while driving $300 million in annual run rate savings. Our business units are executing well and achieved lower non-fuel CASM versus prior year helping to offset nearly a point of overhead pressure from fleet and facility investments. That cost discipline along with the incremental efficiency gains from re-fleeting and One Delta give us confidence in our ability to keep our non-fuel unit costs below 2% next year and beyond. Remaining disciplined with our unit cost is even more important to margin expansion given the recent volatility in fuel. Our September quarter fuel expense increased by $655 million on 30% higher market fuel prices. We offset a portion of this through improved fuel efficiency from our new fleet and our One Delta initiative that reduced APU usage by 15%. While market fuel prices took a pause through mid-August, there's been a run up since then with prices testing new four-year highs. For the December quarter, we expect our all-in fuel price to increase approximately 30% over last year to $2.47 to $2.52 per gallon. Remember this includes a $0.05 headwind from the refinery due to the scheduled maintenance turnaround, which is progressing well and is on schedule to restart in mid-November. We currently forecast December quarter earnings per share of $1.10 to $1.30 per share, which keeps us on pace to achieve our full-year earnings guidance despite the latest increase in fuel. This equates to a December quarter pretax margin in the range of 9% to 11%, consistent with last year's result of 9.8%. This is despite continued pressure from higher fuel costs on our own earnings as well as the earnings of our airline partners, Aeromexico and Virgin Atlantic, of which we recognize 49% through non-operating expense. While 2018 has been challenged with over $2 billion of higher fuel expense, our belief in our ability to drive a fourth consecutive year of pretax earnings of over $5 billion speaks to the resilience of our business and the consistency of our performance. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we generated $1.5 billion of operating cash flow for the quarter, allowing for reinvestment in the business through $865 million in CapEx with nearly $600 million related to aircraft and aircraft modifications. Our full-year CapEx is expected to be $4.9 billion. This is up from our prior guidance, reflecting our recent decision to purchase and finance $600 million of aircraft that were previously slated for operating leases. While our decision to finance the aircraft differently reduces short-term free cash flow generation, net cash flow will be improved as we will finance the aircraft at a substantially lower cost than the lease rates we've been seeing in the market. We remain committed to returning over $2 billion to our owners in 2018. In the quarter, we generated $655 million of free cash flow and return $325 million in share repurchases and $241 million in dividends to shareholders. With consistent returns to shareholders over the past five years, we've reduced our fully diluted share count by 20% and returned nearly $12 billion through both dividends and share buybacks, with our current dividend yield of approximately 2.8%. Over the same time period, we've also reduced our adjusted net debt by $700 million and our pension liability by an astounding $4.6 million at current market rates, dramatically improving the health of our balance sheet. Achieving this level of cash return and the balance sheet strength in just five years is another sign of how different our business is from the past. Last month S&P reaffirmed Delta's investment grade credit rating, underlining the financial strength of the Company. An investment grade rating gives us better access to capital markets and the flexibility and the agility to better manage our business over time. In closing, we delivered solid earnings for the quarter through revenue momentum and bending of the cost curve. Looking into 2019, I'm excited to continue this momentum as we drive the business back to margin expansion. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jill to begin the Q&A. Jill Greer : Thanks Paul. Before we go to Q&A, I'll just have everybody take a minute and mark your calendars as we will return to New York this year for our Investor Day on December 13. So more details we'll go out closer to that date, but in the meantime, hold that date for us. So Lisa, if you could now give the instructions to the analysts for the Q&A? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey, thanks. So, really appreciate the breakout on passenger revenues that you provided in the release. It looks like your business in premium products drove about 70% of your passenger revenue growth in the third quarter. I wondered if you could just break out what's included in that and maybe not a criticism of Delta, but given that all the action is coming from premium, why does the industry spends so much time talking about basic economy. Thanks. Edward Bastian : Well, Duane, I think we've been pretty articulate about why we put basic economy in the marketplace years ago as the industry was being commoditized at the low-end and we didn't really have a product that competed on a like-for-like basis with Spirit or Frontier. I think that was a necessary thing we needed to put in the marketplace and as many people have written, ours was the most humane of all of those as we didn't try to charge for overhead baggage. But really for the commoditized sector, we had something that was well above what they were competing in the OTAs and in the low-end spectrum. And that's when we also started to think about well, what did people want to buy from us that we weren't supplying and that's where we devised these superior products and services and brought them to market. And I think when \u2013 what we get really excited about is we still believe we're in the early innings on this. They are still not as easy as they need to be to buy; they're still not available in all channels with all forms of currency. And over the next years not only will we be expanding those products and services, but we'll make them be easier to buy for our customers and we think that will continue to fuel growth in those sectors. Jill Greer : And Duane, the breakdown is fairly simple. It follows the cabin flown. Duane Pfennigwerth : Sorry, I didn't understand that, Jill. Sorry. Jill Greer : If you flew \u2013 if the customer travels in Delta One First Class, Delta Premium Select, or Comfort+, then it will be in that business cabin and premium product line. Duane Pfennigwerth : That's great. I mean 19% growth on 3% seats so mid-teens RASM growth. That's great that you broke that out. And then Glen, wonder if you could just \u2013 sorry if I missed it, but do you expect domestic unit revenue growth to accelerate into the 4Q? How do we think about the relative regional growth into the December quarter? Thanks for taking the questions. Glen Hauenstein : Yes. We're pretty excited about the current trends in domestic. December is going to be a bit of a challenge because we have a very long period this year between Thanksgiving and Christmas, but we're certain that will become a business period as we get closer to it. But the core trends on business demand and the yields on business demand are in a very good place as we exit this year and head into 2019. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. James Baker : Hey, good morning everybody. First question for Ed, you talked about the industry's ability to recoup higher fuel as never having been faster. I agree with that, but I'm curious as to what you think the driver is. Is it simply that the industry is largely unhedged? Have there been shifts in the booking curve? Are your systems simply better able to articulate schedule changes close? And the reason I ask is that I wonder if it could ever happen faster than say I don't know five or six months. I mean the reason FedEx trade six turns higher than you is that they recoup fuel practically in real time. So, obviously any further progress you or the industry can make should only further bolster your multiple, any thoughts on that? Edward Bastian : Sure, Jamie. Obviously FedEx has the ability to surcharge for fuel, which we do not. So, that's a fundamental difference and we've talked about that in the past, whether that ever becomes an opportunity, I don't know, but that's a regulatory issue not an industry-specific matter that we can control ourselves. I think it's a little bit of everything you mentioned. I'm not \u2013 I don't know what the other airlines are going to report this quarter in terms of their pace of recapture relative to the improvement at Delta, I can tell you it's a number of things. Certainly the health of the business in terms of the brand and service reliability is strong and it gives us the pricing platform. You can only price where you have demand for your product and we have greater demand than ever at Delta. We had our busiest travel quarter in our history and that certainly has given us an ability to make sure we can cover the cost of fuel. I think part of it is the work we've done on the non-fuel side to be able to have zero non-fuel cost growth in productivity, the benefits of upgauging are meaningful, and that certainly helped us real time in terms of that recapture. Technology certainly is a point, the focus on premium product and business travel. Our corporate volumes are up double digits in terms of revenue year-on-year that that's been helpful. So, I think it's a combination of all of the above. It's an interesting question, are we hedged? Is that having an impact on it or not? I don't know, haven't thought too much about that. But certainly it does create across the board of everybody's got the same incentive to make certain that we all are covering costs real time. So probably on the margin, that's helping as well. James Baker : Okay. That helps. And second question for Glen, follow-up to Duane's question. I'm also trying to understand the revenue breakdown on the income statement a little bit better. On the business and premium category, if I buy a $300 main cabin ticket and then I get an upsell offer of $100 when I check in, do you then classify $400 in the premium category or just the upsell? I really just kind of want to understand the mechanics behind the 19% year-on-year increase. Also once I start using miles on my app to upgrade, does that potentially cause the momentum in that category to slow as I guess that would be captured in the loyalty category? Glen Hauenstein : No. I think at the end of the day what we're trying to do is accelerate the usage of these products and services. And as we indicated previously, we are growing those cabins through the upgauge. And as we exit the MD-80s and as we bring on a 321 to substitute it, we generate 20% more premium seats. So the answer is that clearly it comes through different line items, but the revenue is real whether or not you pay with cash or whether or not you pay with mileage. And that's one of the things that we're really excited about is being able to let you do that on your app on the way to the airport. And it doesn't matter to us how it comes through the P&L because it's real revenue either way and what we need to do is continue to have your affinity grow there. And I think when you think about the ecosystem of the frequent flyer program, we want to give you more ways to burn your miles and control your experience, and that's really the key of where we want to take this in the next couple of years is be able to buy what you want from us and be able to supply it to you. And as these things fill up, there's nothing keeping us from making more seats in those cabins because they are the higher margin pieces of our equation. James Baker : Look, I get all that. It's just my concern that as it starts to shift to loyalty when people start using miles, if there is a deceleration in that 19% rate, my concern is that people are going to look at that and say oh! business cabin premium is beginning to slow, which wouldn't necessarily be accurate. So again, when I'm using dollars for an upsell, does that reclassify everything into premium or just the incremental amount of the upsell? Glen Hauenstein : So let me answer the first question is it's the entire amount, so the whole $400 would go because it's where you sat in the cabin. James Baker : I think that's fair, cool. Glen Hauenstein : Right. And we'll try and classify the loyalty by cabin as well because we will \u2013 Jill is looking at me like I'm crazy. But we can figure out how to do that by the time we bring all that online. James Baker : I'm sure I have caused many eyes to roll, so I will turn it over to the next question. Thank you, everybody. Jill Greer : Aspirational goals. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Michael Linenberg : Hey, good morning, everyone. Hey, nice quarter here. I got two questions here for Paul. Just in the rising rate environment, can you just kind of refresh us on what the change in the discount rate for the pension means; like 50 bps, what that means for the liability, number one? And then number two, just your composition of fixed versus floating rate debt, if you have that maybe as of the June or the September quarter here? Thanks. Paul Jacobson : Sure, Mike. Good morning and thanks for the question. So as we've talked about before, every 50 basis points increase in rates on the pension lowers our liability by about $1.2 billion and that's been a good source of traction for us over the last couple of years especially as we have \u2013 we overfunded the pension plan last year with $3 billion of contributions. And then secondly, that interest rate appreciation is actually a very good thing for us in the aggregate because when you look at our P&L, we are actually less than 10% floating rate exposure on a net basis when you take into account cash and the other floating liabilities. So we're in fine shape for higher interest rates and in fact we're a net beneficiary of them. Michael Linenberg : Thanks, Paul. Thanks everyone. Operator : We'll take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just to follow-up on Mike's question there, Paul. You've talked about contributing $500 million to the pension plan next year; I know you used the word overfunded. How do higher rates and the impact on liability impact that decision to use that $500 million toward pension and can you answer that question in the context of how pension contributions impact the NOL if at all? Thanks. Paul Jacobson : Sure. Thanks, Hunter. I probably used the wrong word there in terms of overfunded, funded above our minimum contribution. Hunter Keay : Yes, that's what I meant. Paul Jacobson : But the plan is, as we know, still underfunded overall. Our long-term strategy, the $500 million that we've earmarked next year as well as the $500 million that we've earmarked in 2020 has all been consistent with the expectations of a higher interest rate margin \u2013 environment over time, which gets us well above that 80% funded target. And as we've disclosed at prior Investor Days et cetera, couple of hundred basis points gets us much closer to being fully funded on that pension plan. So that remains part of our strategy and we'll continue to evaluate that as we see the rate environment continue to move. Hunter Keay : Okay. And the NOL portion of the question, does that have any impact on it if you decide to fund more or less? Paul Jacobson : Yes. So contributions to an underfunded pension plan are immediately deductible for tax, so it actually does extend our NOL marginally. Hunter Keay : Okay, thanks. And then another one for you, Paul. As I think about this the sub-2% CASM-Ex number next year and the 3% capacity guide, how sensitive is that CASM-Ex number to that 3%? And I realize that it depends on the type of capacity that's removed, that's gauged, and whatnot and maybe I'm just asking about sort of like variable and fixed costs at the end of the day. But is there a rule of thumb that you've seen from Delta over the years where if you say take out X number of points of ASMs, that loosely translates to X percentage points of headwind in the CASM-Ex side or is it really different every time? Paul Jacobson : It can be different. I think you answered your own question to some extent that it depends where the capacity is being added or taken out, upgauging effects that et cetera. So, I think there isn't really a rule of thumb. As we continue to look through our 2019 planning process, as I've mentioned before, we've got increased confidence about our ability to deliver sub-2% CASM next year and we feel good about those estimates. Hunter Keay : Okay, thanks. Edward Bastian : Hunter, this is Ed. I think one other thing that obviously is playing a role as we look to next year is the improvements we're seeing from the One Delta initiatives. We started to gain some real traction as the year progressed here in 2018 and you see that in the numbers and that's on top of the traditional network changes, upgauging, or the products that we've talked about in the past. And I think that number next year is going to be in the incremental hundreds of million of dollars over 2018. Hunter Keay : Thanks, Ed. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Vernon with Bernstein Research. David Vernon : Hey, good morning and thanks for taking the time. So Glen, it sounds like you guys are recovering the fuel cost increases quicker than you may be have in the past. I was just curious as to your thoughts on how we should expect the stickiness of that revenue to endure if we do end up in a period of maybe a little bit more moderate fuel price. Do you think you will be able to hold on to more of that kind of in the next lower fuel price environment? Glen Hauenstein : I think if you look at the history the last time fuel rolled over, we were still hedged. So I think that the real opportunity is if fuel does moderate without a hedge here that we would be able to have a lot of that flow to the bottom line. That's what happened last time, it took a long time in the wind up and it took a long time in the wind down. So, I would expect that it is very sticky on the way down. David Vernon : All right. And then, Paul, just curious on the cost guidance for \u2013 at least the preliminary cost guidance for next year of 0% to 2%. We're ending the year here kind of 0% to minus 1%. It sounds like the One Delta initiatives have traction. Can you kind of walk us through what the thoughts are there in terms of the expectations for a little bit of a step up into unit cost and where the opportunities might be in 2019? Paul Jacobson : Well, I think the \u2013 as Ed mentioned, the opportunities sit in One Delta, they sit in the general productivity initiatives that we challenge ourselves to achieve every year. Keep in mind there's a little bit of wage pressure next year with a regular increase for the pilots on January 1 as well as lapping the increase that Ed mentioned on this call for the October 1 for the ground and flight attendant. So, those pressures are present every single year and as we work through those in our planning cycle, we can provide more detail at Investor Day. David Vernon : All right. Looking forward to it. Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Daniel McKenzie : Hey, good morning. Thanks, guys. Paul, there has been a lot of bullish commentary around commodities not just today, but over the coming three to five years. And I'm just wondering how you're thinking about this idea that there could be a permanent supply mismatch relative to demand and does it \u2013 really where I'm going with this is does it make sense just given Delta's balance sheet to secure some catastrophic insurance for potential fuel volatility here? Paul Jacobson : Well, good morning, Dan. I think as we talked about it, we're not pursuing any hedging and think that we're in a very good position. I think it's important to note that as we've demonstrated this year, our ability to recover fuel costs in the businesses has accelerated over the past and that's the number one front line from that standpoint. And I think what we've proven here or what we're in the midst of proving is the durability in the business model to be able to absorb that. We've been successful in high oil price environments; we've been successful in low oil price environments. Where it gets a little bit tricky and what you've seen this year is in the volatility, when that moves quickly in one direction or the other. So, I think we continue to believe that we're on the right trajectory without hedging. Certainly, the refinery helps us as does our integrated fuel strategy in which we continue to deliver results that are materially better than the industry average to the tune of $0.07 to $0.10 per gallon. Daniel McKenzie : Understood, okay. And then Glen, with respect to the average upsell rate, the industry started at $25 and I'm just wondering if you can provide some insight into what it was for Delta in the third quarter and what's driving the appetite of corporations to continue to support that buy up? And what I'm getting at is if corporations are offering road warriors more approach just given the tight labor conditions today? Glen Hauenstein : Clearly that's been one of our advantages and Steve and the sales team have done an amazing job getting a lot of the premium products incorporated into the sales agreements that we have today. But we're really only scratching the surface there and we've got a long way to go. That gives us a lot of hope that we will continue to be able to improve there. The other thing is since these are relatively new products as you pointed out. They were pretty coarse in the beginning in terms of our sophistication in marketing to people or ascribing differential in prices based on length of haul or competitive markets. And so now that's what we're really focused on today is to provide much more granularity in terms of that actual upsell rate that will indicate the true value that customers are receiving. So for example on a long haul Transcon flight, it might be $100 each way for an upgrade to Comfort+, well worth that money. But on a short haul competitive market, it may be $5 or $10. And that's generating a higher average upsell rate because we're able to really tailor the offering to what the market is. Daniel McKenzie : Understood. Thanks for the time. Operator : We'll take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savanthi Syth : Hey, good morning. Paul, if I might ask, I know there was some news items about Trainer and looking for a strategic partner. Could you talk a little bit about what you're exploring there and what benefits a strategic partner might make? And just a follow-up on just Trainer in general, with some of this IMO 2020 talk is we're going to get refining margins that expand here, does that improve your kind of relative advantage that Trainer provides? Paul Jacobson : Well, good morning Savi. Thanks for the question. As we've talked about over the years with the Trainer strategy, we've talked often about finding a strategic partnership to take some of the products that we don't need, particularly the gasoline and the diesel, and get us to \u2013 keep us focused on jet fuel and allow us to harness all the benefits while still operating that plant. So with the turnaround coming up, it was a good opportunity to start that process. I won't comment on the process itself, but we continue to work through that. As it relates to IMO 2020, we spent a lot of time talking about it internally and I think the speculation is out there both that it could affect higher crude prices, but the preponderance seems to be that we would expect to see higher jet cracks. That's bad for the airlines, but less bad for an airline that owns a refinery because we produce about 30% to 40% of the refinery's production in diesel and jet fuel that can help offset any increases in jet. So, we would expect that it would continue to help our relative advantage and look forward to continuing to see the benefits of Trainer in the years to come. Savanthi Syth : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Jack Atkins : Right, thank you very much for the time. Paul, just following up on your last point there on IMO 2020, I mean as you think about the broader expectation for pretax margin expansion in 2019, what are you sort of baking into your internal planning with regard to what crack spreads could do or just low prices could do next year as you think about the impact from IMO 2020? Paul Jacobson : Well, thanks for that, Jack. We're generally expecting to see higher cracks especially as we get to the back half of 2019 and we'll be modeling accordingly based on \u2013 depending on where crude ends up as we go through our planning prices. But as a general rule, we tend to plan conservatively on fuel. That's tough when fuel prices are up $2 billion year-over-year, but we still expect that cracks are going to be higher especially as we go to the back half of next year. What there's more uncertainty about is what the crude environment looks like in 2019. Jack Atkins : Okay. Thank you for that. And then as a follow-up question either for Ed or for Glen with regard to tariffs, our sense is that the tariff sort of war that we're seeing between the U.S. and China is beginning to have an impact on your Transpacific global trade flows. Are you seeing any change in corporate behavior in your booking trends either into or out of Asia and do you think the tariffs are having any sort of impact on demand at this point as far as you can tell? Glen Hauenstein : Well, Jack, we really haven't seen any meaningful impact. We're watching it as everyone is. Our Pacific based revenues and China specifically have done quite well in the quarter especially given some of the added capacity that we had put into the market with our recent launch of Atlanta-Shanghai doing well within our range of expectation. So we haven't seen it. Jack Atkins : Okay, great. Thank you again for the time. Operator : We'll take our next question from Helane Becker with Cowen. Helane Becker : Thanks very much, operator. Hi everybody. Thank you for the time. So I think last week, I want to say, Governor Cuomo talked about JFK expansion and I was just kind of wondering you guys have a really nice facility there right now. How will that program affect you both from a cost perspective and from operations perspective? Edward Bastian : Hi Helane, this is Ed. We are obviously working with the Governor as we do with the Port Authority to figure out the long-term strategy at JFK. Right now, I think it's premature. A vision's been laid out. There's a long way to go between taking that vision and some of the initial commitments to actual documentation and deals. Our goal is to unify Terminal 4. So the T2 facility will eventually be brought into Terminal 4 and we'll be building out some additional capacity for Terminal 4, which we're excited by. We don't have that in place with the port yet. We've been talking about that with them for the last couple of years and I support the Governor's vision, creating a more unified version. One of the big challenges at JFK as you appreciate is the alliances are generally not in the same airport facilities as the home carriers and I think over time hopefully, that will get resettled. Helane Becker : Okay. And then does that in any way change \u2013 I think the last conference call you talked about $12 billion over the next decade in airport construction spend. Does that change that number at all? Edward Bastian : Not meaningfully. A little bit of that's in there. We are anticipating that that build-out is not going to be a substantial amount. Helane Becker : Okay. And then can I just ask one last question about looking ahead to the first quarter of 2019 when Brexit kicks in. Ed, you're pretty plugged into Washington. Have you heard anything about agreements being negotiated to continue uninterrupted air travel? Edward Bastian : I don't have any inside intelligence if that's what you're asking me, Helane, I think we all have a vested interest in making certain our access to the UK market remains unfettered and I don't anticipate it's going to be a meaningful issue for us. Helane Becker : Great. Okay. Thanks very much. Jill Greer : And Lisa, we're going to have time for one more question from the analyst. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our last question from the analyst from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Rajeev Lalwani : Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Glen, a question for you. On 4Q CASM \u2013 sorry rather RASM, can you provide just some color on the regional breakdown? I know you talked a little bit about domestic earlier. And then just how you're feeling about the international environment given FX, capacity, and so on? Glen Hauenstein : I think that's a great question. We clearly see the impacts of a stronger dollar on the international arena and I think one of the changes that you'll see as we move toward 2019 is a reemphasis of U.S. point of origin travel over foreign point of origin travels as we reorient our network even further. The recent devaluation of the Chinese currency as well as the Brazilian currency all have an impact on us and so it tends \u2013 we tend to then favor places with high point of sale U.S. as opposed to places where there's higher foreign point of sale and that's I think something we'll be talking about at Investor Day. Rajeev Lalwani : Okay. And then just regionally? Glen Hauenstein : As far as the regions go, I think from what we see now, we're sitting kind of at the bottom as we speak in terms of the Latin to look better than where we've seen in the last few weeks. So I think we're not calling the bottom of the trough, but I think we will start to see growth in Latin over the next couple of months and positioned well into 2019. The Pacific remains strong despite all the rhetoric that Ed just talked about. It's core demand to and from and particularly in the business cabin is very strong. And then Atlantic we're facing some more FX volatility, but the core demand in the Transatlantic remains incredibly strong and we're looking for RASM through the winter to be quite positive despite the fact that there is a lot of capacity in the Transatlantic this winter and as we've talked about it. Rajeev Lalwani : Thanks. If I can sneak one in for Paul there. Sorry for cutting you off, Glen. Paul, can you just talk about some thoughts on CapEx going forward just with higher fuel rates and whether or not you're considering pulling in spend, deferring aircraft and then maybe what's a good number of years over the next couple of years just getting all the moving parts with that what you're leasing and so on? Paul Jacobson : Sure, Rajeev. I think our CapEx strategy of continuing to reinvest 50% of our operating cash flow back into the business is still intact. Obviously we'll be higher than that this year, but given the receptivity of fuel price recapture and what we've been able to do for the P&L, we didn't want to whipsaw the organization and make any short-term adjustments to what we saw as a temporary challenge in the business. So, we're going to continue to march along that path and feel good about the guidance that we've given. The stepup that we talked about today really represents just a different financing decision for the same capital and that will save us tens of millions of dollars a year. Rajeev Lalwani : Great. Thank you. And Ed, good luck with the run next month. Edward Bastian : Thank you. I'm going to need it. Jill Greer : Well, that is going to wrap up the analyst portion of the call and I will now turn over to Ned Walker, our Chief Communications Officer. Ned Walker : Okay. Hey, thanks Jill, and welcome everyone. We'll go ahead and begin the process of the media Q&A at this point. I'd like to ask the media if they could limit themselves to one question and a quick follow-up. We shouldn't be able to accommodate most everyone and Lisa, if you could review the process for queuing up to ask a question, we'll get underway. Thanks. Operator : Yes sir. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Andrew Tangel with The Wall Street Journal. Andrew Tangel : Hi, there. Good morning. Wondering if you all could give us a breakdown of how much you all have raised Main Cabin fares versus business and premium fares so far this year and in the third quarter? Paul Jacobson : We typically don't give that kind of kind of disclosure. Overall, our unit revenues were up 4% in the quarter and much of that was the pricing effect. Andrew Tangel : Well. can you give us an idea of how much more room you've got down the road to raise fares later this year and next year given the inflation elsewhere we're seeing and where incomes overall are nationwide? How much more flexibility do you'll have to raise fares to recover fuel and other costs? Glen Hauenstein : Well, we don't speculate on the upcoming pricing or fare environment. I can tell you that the economy is healthy, demand is very healthy for the Delta product and to the extent oil prices were to continue to rise, we expect to be able to pass along the cost of that. Andrew Tangel : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Kelly Yamanouchi with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Kelly Yamanouchi : Hey, there. I would like to ask what impact you expect President Trump's list of this summer ban on ethanol might have on the Trainer refinery. Paul Jacobson : Well, Kelly, this is Paul. I think we are applauding the administration's efforts to help streamline the renewable fuel standards and improve the market trading of RINs. We have seen a significant benefit in the lower cost of RINs compliance for the refinery this year and applaud the efforts to try to find a solution. Kelly Yamanouchi : Does it affect \u2013 does a change affect your strategic plans for the refinery in any way? Paul Jacobson : No, it doesn't. Like I said, we realized a nice benefit in the lower RINs cost and the refinery is performing well. Kelly Yamanouchi : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Dawn Gilbertson with USA Today. Dawn Gilbertson : Hi, good morning. My question has to do with basic economy. I'm wondering if you guys have seen any impact from Americans move beginning in September to allow a carry-on bag, your more humane approach as you described it? Glen Hauenstein : Well, we have not. We don't sell an incredible amount of basic economy because most of our customer base chooses when they're presented with what those are and the modest amounts to sellup into Main Cabin or even better products, choose to sellup into the Main Cabin. So, it's a very small percentage of our total sales and we haven't seen a change in that with Americans new policy. Dawn Gilbertson : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Leslie Josephs with CNBC. Leslie Josephs : Hi, good morning. Could you tell me what the upsell rate is on from Main Cabin to premium economy for international and then Main Cabin main cabin for Comfort+ domestic? I think basic economy is something like 50% of passengers considering basic economy bought into Main Cabin. I'm just curious about the more expensive economy fares you offer. Edward Bastian : Well, I think it's a lot based on the amount of seats we have available to sales. So, you're asking how many people who are presented with that offer take it, is that the take rate? Leslie Josephs : Yes. Like if there's any gauge of what the percentage is of people that are buying up. Edward Bastian : I think what we could tell you is that the load factors \u2013 the SAT load factors in these cabins are relatively good. We've gone from selling about 13% of the first class for example when we started selling first class to now selling about 60% of the cabin. The rest is available for upgrades. Comfort+ runs a load factor in the high 60s now based on stage. And then Premium Select, which is our newest product and is only available on a minimal number of flights, but we're going to bring that to all of our long haul internationals over the next few years, is off to an amazing start. We're selling about 85% of those seats. Leslie Josephs : Okay. Thank you. And is there any way to upgrade to Premium Select, do you offer that yet or if not, are you considering it? Edward Bastian : Yes. That's what we're excited about in the future is the ability to control your travel and upgrade however you want to with whatever currency you want to use. So you want to \u2013 if your company buys you a coach ticket and you want to sit in the Premium Select cabin, we'll have an offer for you that would be 17,000 miles for you or it\u2019s a $170 in cash. So those kinds of offers are really where we're trying to go with all of that in making it simpler to buy or easier to buy and allowing you to buy it however you'd like to pay for it. Leslie Josephs : Okay. That's available now or that's something that's going to be available? Edward Bastian : Some are available now, some are available \u2013 generally cash is available now, dollars. Mileage will be available in the fourth quarter, but what we're really trying to get to is mileage on mobile, which will be early in 2019. Leslie Josephs : Okay. Thank you. Ned Walker : Okay. And we have time for one more question, please. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Edward Russell with Flightglobal. Edward Russell : Hi. Thank you for taking the question today. Ned Walker : You're welcome, Ed. Edward Russell : I wanted to ask about the performance in Minneapolis. Detroit is very strong in the quarter. However, I've seen some capacity reductions there impacting markets like Akakan and Peoria. Could you talk about the strength there and why you're pulling out some of those connecting markets? Glen Hauenstein : We are growing Detroit. As a matter of fact, we have significant growth in Detroit. We're adding new markets, I believe in November we added Detroit to San Jose and last year we added Detroit to Santa Ana. And so we're trying to make our schedules more relevant to people in Detroit to places people in Detroit want to go, focusing on the top 50 cities that people in Detroit want to go. And to the extent that we are not making money into regional cities, we're rationalizing that capacity out of the network in some of those cities. If you look at the number of people who went from Detroit to Peoria on any given day, it was probably less than 10 and there are alternatives in the region. So streamlining, making the network more efficient, and providing the people in Detroit with places they want to go and we're very excited. Ed last month announced the new services from Detroit to Honolulu. And so we are growing Detroit and we're really committed to Detroit and we're excited about 2019 because there's going to be quite a bit more service into Detroit. Edward Russell : Great. Thank you. End of Q&A Ned Walker : Okay. Thanks, Ed, Glen, and Paul. That concludes our September quarter 2018 conference call. We'll see the analysts at our Investor Day in New York on December 13 and back on the fourth quarter and year-end results call back in January of 2019. Good day, everyone. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning everyone, and welcome to the Delta Airlines December Quarter and Full-Year 2018 Financial Results Conference Call. My name is Augusta, and I will be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would like to now turn the conference over to Jill Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Jill Greer : Thanks, Augusta. Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us. With us in Atlanta today are our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Paul Jacobson. Our entire leadership team is here in the room for the Q&A session. Ed will open the call and give an overview of Delta's financial performance, Glen will then address the revenue environment, and Paul will conclude with a review of our cost performance and cash flows. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, here's Ed. Ed Bastian : Thanks, Jill. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Earlier today, we reported our full-year results, including a December quarter pretax profit of $1.2 billion and earnings per share of $1.30, both of which were at the top end of expectations that we gave you at the start of the quarter. Our top line grew 7% in the quarter. This solid performance combined with our best non-fuel unit cost result of the year offset a $500 million increase in fuel expense. The December quarter marked a successful step on our path to improve margin performance, with our pretax margin expanding over last year's even if excluding the one-time gain from our DGS transaction. 2018 was a successful year for Delta as we delivered strong results for our customers and our owners. Our earnings per share improved nearly 20% over the prior year, and we returned $2.5 billion back to our owners. We ended the year with a 11.6% pretax margin, and a return on invested capital of 14.2%. Notably, our $5.1 billion in pretax income was only 3% below 2017, despite a 30% increase in our fuel expense. The last time we saw a 30% annual fuel increase was 2011, and that year earnings fell approximately 25%. This really sums up the resiliency of our business and how different Delta is. For our customers, Delta's operation is the best in the industry, and 2018 was another record-setting year. We ended the year with 143 days without a single cancellation across the entire Delta system, including both mainline and Delta Connection, exceeding 2017's full-year record of 90 days. For our mainline product alone, we had a record-breaking 251 days without a cancellation, delivering an on-time arrival rate of 85.7%. This exceptional performance by our operations team resulted in Delta being named 2018's Most On-time Global Airline by FlightGlobal for the second year in a row. Running a great operation is the foundation for high customer satisfaction. When combined with the great service our employees provide and the investments we've made in our product, we're creating some of the most loyal customers in the airline industry. We drove improvement in net promoter scores during 2018 in every region of the world. Our domestic net promoter score has tripled over the last decade and reached an all-time high in September of over 50%. All of these results were a reflection of the incredible work of the Delta people, and I'm pleased to recognize our employees' outstanding performance this year with over $1 billion in profit sharing for the fifth consecutive year. As we move into 2019, while fuel volatility has been a major story in the last few months, prices now sit almost exactly where they were a year ago, and by the way where we thought they would be. This, coupled with strong non-fuel unit cost control should position us well for cost stability in the New Year. The revenue environment remains solid. After 8% top line growth last year, we are assuming a modest reduction in global economic growth rates for 2019. We expect top line growth to be 5% this quarter, a rate we are also anticipating for the full year as we communicated last month at our Investor Day. Our revenues to China, a market that's driving some trade and travel concerns, grew 27% in the fourth quarter, and we expect a similar level of growth this quarter. Most importantly for Delta, the domestic revenue environment, which accounts for approximately 70% of our total passenger revenue, continues to do well. Corporate revenues grew 8% in 2018, and recent bookings show this trend continuing. Now, with respect to the government shutdown, we are seeing some pressure on our business. On the revenue front, we're experiencing about $25 million per month in lower government travel. The bigger impact is on our operation; with non-essential work at the FAA shutdown, our Airbus 220 start date is likely to be pushed back due to delays in the certification process. This is also hampering our ability to put seven other new aircraft deliveries into service, but it's our customers who are seeing the biggest impact, with longer lines at airport security. We are working closely with TSA on any steps we can take to minimize these delays, including mobilizing Delta employees to perform nonessential aspects of the security process. We strongly encourage our elected officials to do their very best to resolve their differences and get our government fully open as quickly as possible. In summary, 2018 was a strong year for our customers, owners, and employees. We experienced significant top line demand growth for our product, our operational reliability was record setting, and our brand has never been more healthy. Despite a $2 billion fuel headwind, we generated double-digit margins, topping $5 billion in profits for the fourth year in a row, and we expect 2019 will build on these strengths and deliver a great year of returns for our stakeholders. The demand environment is solid, and our cost base should be stable, resulting in improved earnings and cash flows for our owners, and while we're certainly mindful of the challenges that exist, macro trends, currency headwinds, and extended government shutdown, our team has built a great foundation for our business, and Delta is well positioned for success in 2019. And now, I'll turn it over to Glen to discuss the revenue environment. Glen Hauenstein : Thanks, Ed, and good morning everyone. 2018 was a strong year for Delta. Demand for our product and the affinity for the Delta brand has never been higher. I'd like to thank the Delta team for delivering record revenue and operational results this year, and our customers for their continued loyalty and support. For the full year, revenue grew 8% to nearly $44 billion on unit revenue growth of 4.3%, with a record revenue premium of 112%. Passenger unit revenues improved in all entities for the first time since 2012, with demand strength in both Corporate and Leisure segments throughout the year. Corporate average fares improved 5% and returned to 2016 levels. Non-ticket revenue streams were strong as we diversified our revenue base. Cargo revenue grew 16%, and MRO was up 19%, both producing double-digit margins. Our close relationship with American Express is a source of competitive advantage. In 2018, we drove $360 million of incremental value for a total contribution of $3.4 billion. During 2018, we set a new record with over 1 million co-brand acquisitions, and spend across the card portfolio grew double digits. In the December quarter, revenue grew 7% on a 3.2% unit revenue improvement. Corporate revenues grew 7% in the December quarter on both volume and fare improvements with growth across almost all sectors. Revenues from premium products were up 10% in the December quarter on a 4% increase in premium capacity. On December 7th, Miles as a Currency launched, allowing our customers to redeem miles for post-purchase upgrades. Initial customer response has been strong, with over 30,000 flight upgrades purchased within the first month, driving a 2.5 point increase in upsell on Delta.com. Miles on Mobile will roll out later this month, and we plan to deliver much more additional functionality as we move through 2019. Turning to specific entity performance in the quarter, domestic revenues increased 7.7% on 2.6% higher unit revenues. Both business and leisure revenues grew 8%, and we continue to set records for domestic revenue premium. This is noteworthy given an industry-leading increase in both stage length and gauge. Internationally, we saw the revenue growth of 4.8% on 2.3 points higher unit revenues. Our Latin region returned to positive unit revenue growth of 1% in the December quarter. The Caribbean was the best performing sub entity with 5% unit revenue improvement, and we are really pleased to see recovery taking hold on Mexico, where we posted a 3% rise in growth. In the Pacific, unit revenues were relatively flat year-over-year, with significant increase in stage and currency headwinds offset by strong demand. Japan and Korea saw mid to high single-digit unit revenue growth, with Korea posting the strongest performance. Transatlantic unit revenues increased 4.1 points, but we started to see some cautionary signs in the quarter, in addition to more pronounced currency headwinds. The strength of our absolute performance was unfortunately overshadowed by the 1 point miss to our guidance midpoint. This was attributable to two main factors. First, we gave guidance near the peak of fuel prices, and expected fuel recapture initiatives did not materialize. Second, the early Thanksgiving in 2018 created the longest possible calendar period between the holidays, and revenue during these weeks, while strong, was not as robust as expected potentially due to consumer fatigue during this extended period. Retailers have reported seeing similar trends. Good news here is that January traffic and yields have returned to pre-holiday levels, and demand is back on plan. Looking forward, March quarter total revenue is expected to increase 4% to 6%, with adjusted unit revenue growth of flat to up to on a 4% higher capacity. The two-point sequential change in unit revenue from the December quarter is due to a half-point impact from Easter shifting to late April, a half-point from the timing of JV settlements, and a full point of trends in Europe currency and the government shutdown. We are optimistic about domestic performance for the March quarter. Leisure and corporate demand remain healthy, with strong bookings for the upcoming MLK and President's Day holidays, as well as the spring break period, and the overall outlook for corporate travel is positive. In our most recent survey, 90% of travel managers expected to maintain or increase their travel spend into 2019. This is a two-point improvement over the last survey we did a year ago. For January, on-hand corporate bookings are already up 7% year-over-year with both fares and passenger volumes continuing to improve. Domestic capacity growth for the industry and for Delta is moderate in compared to 2018, and we are seeing improved competitive outlook in Delta hubs. For the March quarter, Latin will be our best-performing international entity driven by the Caribbean and Mexico. Brazil remains challenging as Delta is committed to improving profitability by trimming marginal capacity. With capacity plans down approximately 20% in 2019, we expect Brazil to become rising contributor as the year progresses. In the Pacific, stage length and currency headwinds will persist into the first-half of 2019. For the March quarter unit revenues are expected to remain flattish, but profitability will improve as we capitalize on cost efficiencies from new aircraft, upgraded products and services, and further integrate our Korean joint venture products. In the Transatlantic, we see some cautionary signs in the March quarter. This is the entity expected to be the most challenged. We have seen leisure and corporate impacts in France due to the domestic unrest, and when you combine this with uncertainty of Brexit, a more pronounced currency headwind and the timing of the Easter, which historically impacts this entity the most, we expect modest negative unit revenues for the March quarter. While current trends are not as robust as what we saw in 2018, we are confident that the summer will be strong based on early bookings. We are watching this region closely given the uncertainty and are prepared to adjust capacity as we approach the next shoulder season. In closing, a more diversified revenue base across geographies and products along with a continued pipeline of Delta-specific initiatives give us confidence in our plan of 46% revenue growth in 2019, delivering on this target while also expanding margins is a top priority for Delta. And with that, I would like to turn to my good friend, Paul, to discuss the financials. Paul Jacobson : Thanks, Glen. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. Changing our cost trajectory was the top priority for the finance team in 2018, and I am pleased to say that December quarter non-fuel unit costs were down 0.5%. Importantly, our full-year unit cost growth of 1.4% marked an inflection in our cost trajectory, putting us back within our long-term target of keeping unit cost growth below 2%. I would like to thank the entire Delta team for their hard work and innovative thinking. Our operating units are executing well on cost, achieving lower non-fuel chasm year-over-year, which is helping to offset overhead pressure from fleet and facility investments. Hats off Gill and the operations team for a job well done. Our 2018 performance and initiates underway, give us confidence in our path to 1% non-fuel cost growth in 2019. In the March quarter, we expect non-fuel unit cost to increase 1% to 2%. Relative to the December quarter, there is incremental cost pressure for maintenance timing ahead of summer flying with about half of the full-year increase in maintenance occurring in the first quarter and creating approximately 1.5 points of pressure. Despite this pressure and as evidenced by the midpoint of our chasm guide, we expect each quarter of the year to be 1.5% or lower, which this quarter is expected to be the high water mark and is consistent with our guidance at Investor Day. In 2019, we expect an additional $350 million of benefit from One Delta beyond the $150 million realized in 2018, and we'll continue to see benefits from re-fleeting as we replace aging narrow bodies throughout the year. Turning to fuel, our total fuel expense drove $508 million of pressure in the December quarter. Our all-in fuel price of $2.42 per gallon was 25% higher than prior year. While market prices moderated significantly from the beginning of the quarter, inventory pre-purchases and the scheduled maintenance turnaround at the refinery drove a $0.16 headwind during the quarter. For the March quarter, we expect our all-in fuel price to be roughly flat to last year. Some of this is driven by a loss at the refinery of approximately $40 million due to lower gasoline crack. We currently forecast March quarter earnings of $0.70 to $0.90 per share, an approximately 10% improvement over prior year at the midpoint. This equates to a March quarter pretax margin in the range of 6.5% to 8.5% compared to last year's 7.1%. Our full-year results in 2018 were impacted by two unique items, the sale of 51% of our Delta Global Services business, and early adoption of the new lease accounting standard. These two items together increased 2018 earnings per share by $0.14, adjusted for profit sharing, with the majority of that benefit coming in non-operating expense. As we said at investor day, in 2019, in we expect non-operating expense to be $450 million to $500 million. This is $350 million to $400 million higher than 2018 primarily due to a lower pension benefit and the lapping of the gain from the DGS sale. And finally, our strong cash generation and healthy balance sheet allowed to Delta to execute on investment opportunities and consistently return capital to shareholders. During 2018, we generated $7 billion of operating cash flow, and invested $4.7 billion back into the business, resulting in free cash flow o $2.3 billion. In 2019, we expect to produce roughly $8 billion in operating cash flow, and free cash flow of $3 billion to $4 billion, which is more than 50% higher than last year, and represents an approximate 10% free cash flow yield at our current stock price. As outlined at investor day, we are planning capital spending of $4.5 billion in 2019 as we continue to replace our fleet and invest in our product and technology. 80% of this spend is fleet related, including the replacement of less efficiency narrow bodies. Our investments are transforming our fleet to drive margin benefits through higher customer satisfaction, increased premium seats, and significant cost efficiency gains. For the first quarter, we expect capital spending of roughly $1.3 billion as we take delivery of 29 aircraft in the quarter. We remain committed to consistent return of capital to our owners as well. In the December quarter, we returned $325 million in share repurchases and $238 million in dividends, for a total of $2.5 billion returned to shareholders for the year. We expect a similar level in 2019, in line with our target of returning 70% of free cash flow to shareholders annually. Over the past five years, we have reduced our fully diluted share count by more than 20%, returning more than $12 billion through dividends and share buybacks, with a current dividend yield of nearly 3%. Importantly, we've done that while also reducing our debt and our pension liability, improving the health of our balance sheet. We are comfortable with the current level of debt, and as we highlighted in investor day, we have moved to a long-term leverage ratio target of 1.5 to 2.5 times adjusted debt to EBITDAR. This ratio was 1.9 at the end of 2018. Our targeted range should allow us to maintain investment grade ratings through a business cycle, and also includes the incremental lease liabilities recognized with the adoption of lease accounting. At year-end, our pension funded status was 68%, with an unfunded pension liability of $6.4 billion. Our 2018 planned asset returns underperformed our target of 9% by about 14 points. This return shortfall will reduce our pension benefit in 2019, contributing to the year-over-year pressure in non-operating expense. Looking back on 2018, I am extremely proud of what we have accomplished at Delta. We successfully navigated challenges and have positioned the company for another year of solid top line growth, and more importantly margin expansion, which should drive double-digit growth in our earnings and free cash flow in 2019. As Ed said at the outset of this call, this performance is enabled by the Delta difference, our combination of the powerful brand coupled with our unmatched competitive advantages continue to deliver industry-leading results, and drive long-term value for our owners. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jill to begin the Q&A. Jill Greer : Augusta, we are ready for questions from the analysts, if you could give instructions on how to get into the queue. Operator : Certainly. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good morning everyone, and thanks for taking my question. So I guess Ed or Glen, I mean you guys mentioned challenges from European economies that look maybe a little bit slower this year, the government shutdown here in the U.S., maybe some lingering challenges in the Pacific and Latin. So, I guess when we look at capacity growth, I think scheduled right now in 2Q is about 4.6. What's the ability to take capacity down if some of these trends continue or even worsen from here? Glen Hauenstein : Well, first of all, we're very encouraged by -- you kind of characterized this global slowdown as all the same, and I'd like to put some qualifiers on there. We're actually quite excited about the Latin trajectory. If you recall, this is the first quarter after two quarters of it being negative that it's returned to positive, and we see Latin accelerating as we move into 1Q and then throughout the year. We see very solid returns in the domestic. And remember, last year was a really great year for the Transatlantic, one of the best years we've ever had. So being in the flattish in the off-peak season is really -- I wouldn't characterize it as something that we're fearful of, but we're going to keep a very close eye as we read all these papers and we read the current events, we see what's going on in France, the still uncertainty over Brexit finally coming to a head here, but we know the summer in Europe is going to be great with lower fuel prices, so we're really looking more towards the back-half of the year and do we need to make additional adjustments when we get past the summer peak, and we'll keep a close eye on that, and we'll report back to you. Brandon Oglenski : Okay, I appreciate that, Glen. And I guess we've heard it from FedEx too that maybe Europe is incrementally slow from here, so that's why I asked. But thinking more broadly, if the market is really concerned here that the economy will slow, because it's not necessarily slowing right now, with 35% of your passenger revenue tied up in premium products, should investors be thinking that maybe the Delta business now is more cyclical than maybe it was in the past? And I think at the analyst day you guys tried to answer that and said, you said look, the spread between a premium ticket and the economy ticket actually isn't that far off, so we don't think so, but can you give folks maybe some additional ideas on why this may not be as cyclical as folks think? Ed Bastian : Well, I think there's two things we should talk about in that question, and the first is the disparity between the higher ending corporate travel and the lower ending leisure. The spread between those, absent other premium products, is at an all-time low. If you think about what's happened over the past couple of years, leisure fares have continued to increase, and we've had very stubborn corporate yields. And while we return to 2016 levels, we're still far off the peaks that occurred many, many years back. So if you think about the last cycle or some of the big cycles, we had really big differentials in the realized fare from corporate versus leisure, and those at a macro level have never been closer if you were thinking how does the next cycle play out. So, I think that's a very big issue we need to talk more about because that should make it, the whole industry, a lot less cyclical. And then in the premium products, I think if there was a tick down in demand, we're more than confident that all of the new products and services and the way we're distributing and the broadness that we're able to offer, including their Pay with Miles feature and things like that, we would be able to offset weakness in demand by bringing new ways to buy the product into the marketplace. So really confident on both those, and we should probably talk more about that as we move through the year. We hear a lot of your concerns about where we are in the cycle, and while we haven't really seen any weakness in domestic, we are mindful that we are many years into this expansion, and eventually we will face a recessionary or contractionary environment, and we're planning for it, and we'll tell you more about why we feel so confident that we will weather the next cycle so much better. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Michael Linenberg : Yes, hey. Two quick ones here; Glen, you had highlighted the headwinds on RASM in the March quarter, and I heard government shutdown in currency is like a point, Easter shift is a half-a-point. What was -- there was another thing you mentioned, another 50 basis points, what was that again? Glen Hauenstein : There was foreign exchange and JV settlements. Michael Linenberg : Okay, the JV settlement piece. Okay. Glen Hauenstein : And that's really just a timing issue of when they come in and when they go out. That should balance out throughout the year. Michael Linenberg : Okay, great. And then just my second question, there was commentary about how strong sales were to China, and then there was some positive commentary about Japan and Korea, and I noticed that the Pacific RASM was down a smidge. What was driving that? Is that more stage length? Is there another part of the Pacific, like Australia, where you're just -- you're seeing a lot of weakness? Ed Bastian : No, most of that -- all of it is stage lengt,h because in China, as you know, we discontinued the Narita to Shanghai route, and replaced it with Atlanta to Shanghai, so the RASM, while it's lower, the profit potentials are significantly higher, and so that's what driving a slightly negative Chinese unit revenue, but all based on stage length. Michael Linenberg : Great, that makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi Syth : Hey, good morning. Just a clarification from Glen, on the domestic commentary you mentioned solid trends. So just outside of Easter and maybe kind of the government shutdown should we assume that the magnitude is similar at least at the core level? Glen Hauenstein : Yes, I think we're very confident. We had that little blip in December, right around the holiday. But as January and everybody came back from work we are back on track. And the corporate trends and the leisure demand look very similar to what we saw in the earlier part of 4Q. Savi Syth : That's helpful. And just a follow-up on the Trainer -- the color that you provided, Paul, that was helpful. Just trying to understand what's driving the loss in 1Q and how we should think about it as the year progresses? Paul Jacobson : Sure, Savi. Good morning, and thanks for that question. There are two big impacts year-over-year with Trainer, one is the difference in gasoline cracks, they're trading at pretty historic lows right now, which is putting some pressure on the production at Trainer on a year-over-year basis. The second was we benefited last year from a slight revaluation of a RINs liability that we were holding from 2017. So with those lower RINs prices -- RINs have been traded relatively flat. We've satisfied our 2017 and '18 obligation to date, so that's a smaller impact, but it's primarily driven by those lower gasoline cracks, which we expect should reverse over the year, especially as we get in to summer season. Savi Syth : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Joe Caiado with Credit Suisse. Joe Caiado : Thanks very much. Good morning everyone. First question is for Paul on unit costs. I appreciate the color on the timing of the maintenance spend here in Q1 and the expected cadence for the year. But at a high level, can you just talk about where you see the biggest risks and opportunities in your cost structure to either materially outperform or underperform your 1% CASM-Ex target for the year? Paul Jacobson : Sure. Good morning, Joe. We've come out of 2018 with a lot of momentum that we expect to continue into 2019, so I'm optimistic on our One Delta initiatives in particular as we continue to progress and get better at that enterprise level of thinking, but I'm also optimistic about the fleet efficiencies that we'll get. We'll take approximately 60 airplanes in the first-half of the year, and as that phases in over time we start to realize some of those efficiencies going forward. So again, I reiterate the optimism in conveyed at investor day, feel very confident about our 1% goal and the timing of maintenance was fully expected in that when we gave that guidance on a quarterly basis. Joe Caiado : Okay, thanks. And then a question for Glen on cargo, I was curious if you could give us some more color on what you're seeing in the cargo operation, particularly across the Pacific, and what you're seeing there in terms of volumes and yields, and whether or not it makes sense for us to think of that as potentially being a leading indicator of what we might see in passenger demand? Gil West : Yes, this is Gil West. Just a couple of comments on cargo; first, the cargo business had an exceptionally strong year in 2018, as you probably know, revenues were up over $100 million or 16% as Glen mentioned, due large part to the yield performance. So despite lapping some pretty challenging comps year-over-year, we're seeing yield performance continue to hold strong. We do see some volume pressures, some geography to that, as you allude to, that's occurring. But I will say revenue growth, while it's moderating, is still up single digits driven primarily by yield performance. Joe Caiado : And should we view that as a potentially leading indicator of what we might see with volumes on the passenger demand side, or is that not the right way to think about it? Gil West : I think you've got to think about what's going on with the tariffs in the more macro sense, and how people are trying to offset tariffs with it. They're using air or sea and I think we could always look at leading economic indicators, but we are very, very close when we look at that passenger revenue side, and we don't see the same trends translating into the passenger revenue side, and I think we don't try to get ahead of ourselves, we try and size what their revenue is going to be as quickly as we can, and then we make the appropriate decisions. Joe Caiado : Understood, and appreciate all the color, thanks everyone. Operator : We'll go next to Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Andrew Didora : Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. First question for Glen; now that you 're breaking up a premium product versus main cabin, now I did notice that growth in premium revenues did decelerate a little bit to up 10 in 4Q versus, I think, you're tracking like a mid-teens rate earlier in the year. What changed here, and really interested in Glen, getting your thoughts on you know, how -- what's your read on this? Do you view how this premium revenue bucket has a good read across for corporate spend? Glen Hauenstein : No, I think you got one thing -- two things going on. One, is the base is increasing dramatically, so we didn't expect that we would be in the mid to high teens as the base continued to grow, and second is that the quarter had the least number of premium seats in it that we'll have over any quarter. So we were tracking at about plus eight on the premium seat count. This quarter was about plus four, and as we go into '19, that number will go back up to plus six. So your ability to sell premium is also related to the inventory you have and the 4Q number was the lowest inventory growth that we'll have for the next few quarters. Andrew Didora : Oh, got it, that makes sense. And then my second question revolves around more on the government shutdown, and look I appreciate that this is a pretty fluid situation, but -- I know you guys called out a lack of corporate contracts on the government side traveling, but have you seen anything in your bookings, or conversations with your corporate travel managers that would indicate that maybe corporates might be beginning to delay travel given the crowding issues that have popped up at the airports, or is that not in the conversation, yet, thanks? Ed Bastian : Andrew, this is Ed. No, we're not seeing any evidence that before looking at this extended shutdown as anything other than something that's going to be resolved hopefully soon. Andrew Didora : Got it. Okay, thank you. Operator : Well, go next to Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : Thank you. Good morning. Ed Bastian : Good morning. Paul Jacobson : Good morning. Hunter Keay : Hey, Paul. Good morning. So Paul, that pension plan return of -5%, what happened there? I think you guys said in your 10-K you get about 40%, 50% of gross seeking assets. I'm wondering if that's what drove it, and how are you thinking about that pension plan asset allocation, given some of the comments you made about maybe some concerns you may be starting to having around global economic growth? Paul Jacobson : Sure, Hunter. So as you know, the pension plan has a pretty long life, and with a approximate 9% expected return, we tend to be heavily weighted toward equities. It was a challenging year in the equity markets across the board, but particularly in global stocks around emerging markets, et cetera. We're always looking at ways to tweak that, but we do that through a lens of a long-term expected return matching that, that liability profile. So be careful not to overreact, but at the same time we want to manage that exposure prudently. Hunter Keay : Okay. And then, maybe this is a question for Glen. Do you know how many seats, do you want to maybe take a stab at quantifying this, Glen, you know how many seats go unsold relative to your target, like maybe seven or 10 days before the flight today, and maybe how that's changed in the era of well, oil prices or higher industry capacity growth, and basically wondering if the industry is just a little bit more geared, particularly you guys, I should think, Delta, is just a little bit more geared towards that last minute, seven-day AP window than maybe you were five, six years ago? Can you provide any data around that for me? Glen Hauenstein : Yes, I think when you look at where we have been going into each one of the months in 2018 and into 2019, we've entered the months actually ahead in load factor. So we've actually become a little bit less reliant on the very close end demand, and that's really where we want to continue to position ourselves in '18 as with a little bit less risk on the table as we head into each one of the months. Hunter Keay : Okay, thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey, thanks. Just with your commentary about aircraft induction delays, I think I understand that the A220 in certification process, but I think you mentioned some other aircraft types. Can you just expand on why this shutdown is driving delays? Gil West : Gil. Of course, the A220, we've talked about, I think. There is some potential impact on some other fleets, namely, the A330900neos and it gets back into certification issues that we certify seats and crew rest and things of that nature, Wi-Fi systems that with the government shutdown become problematic for us. So there's not an immediate impact, but it certainly could have a impact, downstream, on us. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thanks, that's helpful, and then with the A220s, specifically, can you just remind us what aircraft types are those replacing? So in other words, are you going to be parking 717s, and are these delays part of what is driving maybe some maintenance pressure in the short run as you keep these older aircraft around? Gil West : Duane, I think you're overthinking it. We're not expecting this to be an extended delay and the primary aircraft the initial 220s are replacing are really long range two class RJs of course, some MD-80s as well. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay, thank you. Operator : We'll go to next to Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Jamie Baker : Hey, good morning, everybody, first one for Glen. I'm guessing the majority of your passengers that do fly in government fares have SkyMiles accounts. Can you give us a feel for how much these passengers drive in terms of non-government spend? I mean, for somebody in tech or finance, you know, their personal spend is a fraction of what their annual corporate spend probably is. I just don't really know how that dynamic looks for a typical government employee, obviously, trying to figure out the knock-on effect on leisure spend even if the government were to reopen tomorrow? Glen Hauenstein : Right. We're trying to quantify that right now. As you might imagine, it's kind of difficult to figure out all of the implications because you have multiple dimensions there, but that's -- our estimate of $25 million includes all of those components. So it's not just\u2026 Jamie Baker : Oh, it does? Glen Hauenstein : Yes. Jamie Baker : But presumably, any reduced leisure spend by government employees in January wouldn't have manifested in January, I mean, you don't come back from vacation and then start working and then go on another vacation, right, so that's in your future -- somewhere else in the quarter in other words? Glen Hauenstein : Exactly. I mean, we'll see how long\u2026 Jamie Baker : Okay. Glen Hauenstein : ,: Jamie Baker : Okay. And second and probably for Paul, I mean, Ed answered the question about you know, at point A220 delays might pressure -- CASM, but is there any lingering impact from all the tariff noise, I haven't been paying close attention recently. Not sure, which plant you're taking the aircraft from, also have you figured out the network impact? Are these going to be spread far and wide eventually, or should we think of a 220 as, I don't know, or of a Boston plane or a Seattle plane, or something like that? Just wondering how they fit within the domestic network construct? Paul Jacobson : I think you're right in your assumption that they'll be primarily focused on the coastal gateways as opposed to the interior hubs where we can drive more cost efficiency and higher volumes. Jamie Baker : Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much. Paul Jacobson : Right. Operator : We'll go next to Helane Becker with Cowen. Helane Becker : Thanks very much [technical difficulty] Ed Bastian : Helane, we can't hear you, could you repeat your question? Helane Becker : Oh, can you hear [technical difficulty]\u2026 Ed Bastian : No, we can't hear you. Helane Becker : Well, Operator, can you open the right line? Operator : There you are, Helane. Helane Becker : Is that better? Ed Bastian : Yes. Helane Becker : Oh, good, okay. I think there's just a problem with me calling in from London, and my office calling in from New York. Just a question on TechOps, and that -- I didn't hear you talk about that, but could you just talk about the cadence for revenue growth in that business, and how that's shaping up your -- and maybe the first half of the year that would offset the other pressures that you're seeing in maintenance? Gil West : Sure. This is Gil. So, our MRO business and TechOps, you know, again had a great year in 2018. They pushed a little over 700 million, up a 100 million year-over-year. We see a similar trend in 2019, a little more moderated growth, but still pushing probably close to 800 million. Longer term though, as you probably know, we've made investments in our capabilities, new engine shop, new test sell, all that as a foundation to introduce two new engine type fleets into our MRO that work the gear turbo fan Pratt Whitney engine and the Rolls Royce Trent series engine, and then longer term as that revenue ramps, we will see over a billion dollars a year incremental revenue from those two engine titles. Helane Becker : From those alone not including the other business? Gil West : That's correct. Helane Becker : Great. Okay. Well thanks everybody. Thanks for being patient. Gil West : Thanks, Helane. Ed Bastian : Thanks, Helane. Operator : We will go next to Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Joseph DeNardi : Yes, good morning. Paul, the ROI of 9% is about as high in assumption as I've seen, can you just talk about the sustainability of that, what the knock-on effects would be, if you lowered it, and whether lowering it is contemplated in your earnings guidance for '19? Paul Jacobson : Sure, Joe. Good morning. The 9% expected return assumption is at the high end of corporate plans, but remember that our plan is unique, not only to Delta in the airline industry, but to all corporate plans because of airline relief. So what we have done is taken an approach where we've proactively funded with a little bit more of an aggressive return profile, because we have the time to do that with airline relief with having fully met our minimum obligations through 2024. So, it has always been in our plans that we would work on reducing the risk in that portfolio as we get closer to fully funded, but what I would say is the long-term returns of that plan, as we've thought about it over the last 10 years have been wholly consistent with that strategy of trying to drive a better funded status through both contributions and investment returns, and that will change over time, but there's no change contemplated in the rate in 2019. Joseph DeNardi : Okay, that's helpful. And then Glen, I just have a two-part revenue question for you; first is, I think your agreement with AmEx probably comes up in a couple years typically when both parties are happy though they'll extend that early, so can you just talk about the timing of that, and what sort of revenue opportunity that could offer you? And then whether you've changed the way that you guide based on kind of the challenge you've had over the past couple years of hitting guidance, whether first quarter guidance is different than it has been? Thank you. Glen Hauenstein : Well, we don't comment on any potential negotiations. So I'll defer on the first one, but on the second one, we clearly have heard our investors that they want us to make sure that we hit our targets and we -- while we get hit inside the range, 3.2 is in the range of three to five we know that we lowered in order, and so we're examining that and I'd say we don't want to miss again, it's too painful for everybody. Joseph DeNardi : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Catherine O'Brien: Good morning everyone. Thanks for the time. So, first question just on business travel, I usually think about business travel being booked within seven days, but I could imagine booking curves for international business travel could be slightly longer in average. So, could you maybe talk about the differences in the booking window you see between regions, and then is there a region in particular maybe where that that booking curve is longer or shorter, or you build in more cushion or less cushion to your forecast? Thanks. That's my first question. Paul Jacobson : Sure, yes. You can kind of think of the booking curve related to how far the trip is. So, the further you go around the world, the earlier the general booking curve is.  Very short haul things like Atlanta to Jacksonville, Atlanta to Orlando, New York to Atlanta have closing booking window as well. New York to China, or New York to Japan, or Atlanta to Japan, we have very long booking window. So that's the general rule of thumb. What was -- there was another part of that? Catherine O'Brien: Yes, and then the second part was just keeping that in mind, do you build in more or less cushion, given some of these longer booking windows for international into your forecast than you might for domestic? Paul Jacobson : Oh, of course, the way we build our forecast is really what's happening in the last few weeks versus what happened in the last few months versus what's happened in the last few years. So, it's a very complicated mathematical equation, and for those that have longer booking windows, we clearly take that into account. Catherine O'Brien: Understood, and if I could just ask a quick follow-up on the government shutdown math. So, when you're saying $25 million a month, -- are you just in the march quarter guidance, are you just thinking that in for the month of January, or I know that you said, there's a point for your flowing government shutdown, and maybe FX, is the government shutdown most of that point or how should we think about that? Ed Bastian : Catherine, this is Ed. We're not going to speculate what's going to happen with the government shutdown. We commented on the $25 million, so people can see what the current run rate is. It's one of the risks that we considered in coming up with our overall unit revenue guide, but I don't think we should get that level of precision into the guidance. Catherine O'Brien: Understood. Thank you very much. Jill Greer : I guess that we're going to have time for one more question from the analysts. Operator : And that will come from David Vernon with Bernstein. David Vernon : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. First question is really again a continuation of some of the government questions, but I guess [technical difficulty] so maybe baked into the one quarter guide associated with the shutdown or how long this thing would happen to go before you have to be worried about some of the cost guidance for the year? Glen Hauenstein : David, we lost your first part of your question, could you repeat it? David Vernon : Oh, sorry. The question was -- like trying to dimension whether or not there's any of the government shutdown cost associated with aircrafts delay, stuff like that in the guidance, and how long we would need to see this go before you'd be worried about an impact to the unit cost guide, either in 1Q or for the year? Glen Hauenstein : We don't expect it to have a meaningful impact on the unit cost guide in either the quarter or the year. David Vernon : Okay. And then Paul, maybe just as a quick follow-up, could you give us a sense for how non-op expense should look for the full-year? Paul Jacobson : As we talked about, David, non-op expense is going to be pretty even throughout the year, that pressure from the pension gets spread evenly throughout the year. So, it should be pretty consistent. David Vernon : Okay, thank you very much for the clarifications. Jill Greer : That's going to wrap up the analyst portion of the call. I'll hand it over to Ned Walker. Ned Walker : Okay. Hey, thanks very much, Jill. Good day, everyone. We will go ahead and begin the Media Q&A at this time. I'd like to ask everyone if they could ask one question with the brief follow-up. That way, we should be able to accommodate almost everyone, and Augusta, if you could review the process for asking a question, we'll go ahead and begin. Operator : Thank you. Again, it is now the media portion of the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We will pause for just a moment. We'll go first to Andrew Tangel with The Wall Street Journal. Andrew Tangel : Hi, there. Wondering about the shutdown and long lines, can you give us some idea of how much you're seeing in a way of passengers getting delayed, missing flights, maybe missing connections at customs, if there are shorting stoppages, and what kind of financial impact is that having on Delta, and have you been able to measure that as a material in any way in terms of rebooking cost and so forth? Ed Bastian : Andrew, this is Ed. We're not seeing a meaningful impact. The operations are running on schedule, on time, our team is doing a great job of working with the TSA to help the cues moving forward. I mentioned earlier today that the TSA published yesterday they had an unscheduled absence rate of 7% that compares to a 3% rate. They typically run, so it's in isolated airports we are having some longer lines, but it's not a system-wide issue at all, and to the extent that customers are impacted by delayed lines, we are re-accommodating them and getting them to their destinations in good manner. Andrew Tangel : And just as a follow-up on the A220. You mentioned in your remarks that the shutdown is causing $25 million from government workers. But just wanted to know how much will you be leaving on the table as the launch is delayed for weeks and weeks? Is there a way you could quantify that? Ed Bastian : We are not anticipating that outcome. That's probably the short answer. We are not leaving any money on the table. We are not going to be canceling routes or flights. We will just delay the introduction of that specific aircraft type. Andrew Tangel : Thanks. Operator : We will go next to Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Mary Schlangenstein : Thank you. You talked earlier in the call about the dip in the corporate travel and the bookings right before Christmas and then how that rebounded. Can you talk just a little bit more on that in general terms on was it just the one week? Or, did that one-week extend into the start of the New Year and you've rebounded since then? Paul Jacobson : I think it was really specific to the long period between Thanks Giving and Christmas. And it wasn't corporate. It was really just an across the board lull. As you know, once every seven years this occurs where the first day of the year is on a Thursday in November and creates the very longest possible period between the holidays. I think you are seeing a lot of people talk about this, not only in our industry where that long period probably is not advantage for airlines or retail. So, next year it moves again and it will move a lot closer. And we are not expecting that to recur. And yet, all the trends did go online right after the holidays. Ed Bastian : And Mary, this is Ed, just to affirm, we had a great Christmas, all time record in terms of volume that we carry. So, it wasn't a lull. It was just the impact on pricing was a little softer than we anticipated, but it was a very very strong Christmas and holiday season for us. Mary Schlangenstein : Great. And if I could just ask on the seven planes at that are being delayed into entry, does that include the A220s, and if so, how many? And then the other question is related that. Were others all A330 900s or were there some other fleet types in there? Paul Jacobson : We are not going to get in all those details. It's primarily the Airbus 220, yes, but as Gil mentioned earlier, the 330neo could also be impacted here. Mary Schlangenstein : Great. Thank you. Operator : We will go next to Leslie Josephs with CNBC. Leslie Josephs : -- my question, I just wanted to clarify. It's $25 million a month in lost revenue or just January? And also on the shutdown, what else can you not do? I mean you mentioned the 330neo and then internet, can you launch new route. So what can you not do with FAA furloughed? Paul Jacobson : On the revenue estimate, $25 million is what we are seeing in the month of January. Obviously if it was to continue, we think that's in order of magnitude number, but we don't know what those impacts could be, and we're not seeing any significant operational challenges. The introduction of new aircraft pipes for us is primarily is the Airbus 220 and 330neo. And that's where our concerns are limited to. Leslie Josephs : Is there any issue especially on the TechOps with hiring mechanics with some FAA furloughed, or hiring on any aspects of the business? Paul Jacobson : We're not seeing any meaningful change. Certainly, the on-boarding is delayed a little bit for any new hires in that space. But again, it's something hopefully that we are going to be moving through relatively quickly. We are not making any changes in our producers. Leslie Josephs : Okay, thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Tracy Rucinski with Reuters. Tracy Rucinski : Hi, my questions have already been answered, but just one more shutdown-related question. You said that you haven't seen any impacts on bookings, but has been any rise in passengers canceling travel plans this month that can be attributed to the shutdown? Paul Jacobson : We're not seeing that. The $25 million estimate we gave for the month of January is inclusive of all the above -- all those factors. Tracy Rucinski : Oh, that's not just government contractors? Paul Jacobson : It's government contractors and any knock-out effects that can we see that are related to that; the best that we can tell. Tracy Rucinski : Okay, thanks. Operator : Next we will hear from Benjamin Zhang with Business Insider. Benjamin Zhang : Good morning, gentlemen. I just had a quick question about the 52% revenues from coming premium products in non-ticket -- sources. You guys mentioned there is a 14% or sorry double-digit increase in that. What do you foresee for 2018? Do you expect that growth to continue at that space? Glen Hauenstein : Yes, we expect that we'll continue to grow in premium products and services more than we grow the base fare products. So, if you think about our total growth of 4% to 6% next year that would indicate that we are growing significantly higher on the premium product side. So, probably close to that 10% to 15% as we have in the past few years. Benjamin Zhang : Great, thank you. Ned Walker : Okay, I guess that we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. That will come from Elliott Blackburn with Argus Media. Elliott Blackburn : Good morning. Thanks for making time for me. You guys had a process late last year exploring a partnership options at the refinery. Just curious if you can give us an update on what you determined in that, or if it continues, and also curious just more broadly if Delta is looking at making any other non-maintenance investments maybe logistics to bringing crude from the Macon [ph] and that refinery to improve performance? Ed Bastian : Good morning. We have continued with that process and have received some interest and having discussions with parties. There is no update on the strategy broadly as we articulated. We are looking for ways to enhance the value and the strategic value to Delta of the refinery through a partnership, and those discussions can be complicated, but right now, we are focused on running and operating the refinery as efficiently as we can. We just came out of a major turnaround investment that is done every five to six years. And the refinery is running quite well. So, nothing needed in terms of enhancing the performance. Elliott Blackburn : Okay. So, you are satisfied with the access that you have to crude right now? You don't feel like you need to build anything on to that? Ed Bastian : Absolutely. So, we take a wide variety of crude. Sometimes we swing domestically and some internationally, and we have the logistics to be able to take advantage of that as those opportunities present themselves. Elliott Blackburn : All right, thanks very much. Ned Walker : Okay. Thanks Ed, Glen, Paul, and Gil. And that does conclude our December quarter and full-year 2018 earnings call. We will back here again in April when we report our March quarter 2019 earnings. Have a good day everyone. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation today.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Please standby, we\u2019re about to begin. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Delta Airlines March Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. My name is Jake, and I will be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jill Greer : Thanks, Jake. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our March quarter earnings call. Joining us from Atlanta today are our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Paul Jacobson. Our entire leadership team is here in the room for the Q&A session. Ed will open the call and give an overview of Delta\u2019s financial performance, Glen will then address the revenue environment, and Paul will conclude with a review of our cost performance and cash flows. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up. Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta\u2019s SEC filings. We\u2019ll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted, and you can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, here\u2019s Ed. Ed Bastian : Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Earlier today, Delta reported an $832 million pre-tax profit, or $0.96 per share. The core business performed well and we saw nice upside from our contract renewal with American Express. We grew our earnings per share by 28%, expanded our operating margin by a 150 basis points and delivered an after-tax return on invested capital of 14.5% over the last 12 months. This performance demonstrates how we are translating our unique brand, unmatched competitive advantages and pipeline of initiatives to drive earnings growth, margin expansion and solid returns for our owners. This also underscores our confidence that we have in our future, which is one of the reasons why we accelerate our share repurchases, returning $1.6 billion to our shareholders this quarter. We achieved 7.5% top line growth, as demand for our product remains strong. Our Ancillary businesses delivered double-digit growth and we extended our leadership in delivering great value for our customers. This starts with industry-leading reliability as the world\u2019s best run airline. We delivered the best March quarter completion factor in our history at 99.06% despite a very difficult winter weather. Reliability in our culture of service underpin the strength of our brand and allow us to build lasting customer relationships. Domestic net promoter score has averaged 50% this year, up 7 points versus last year. This is the reason we sustained the best revenue premium in the industry, and it\u2019s not just our customers who noticed. Earlier this week, Delta topped the airline quality rating and was the only airline to improve in all categories. Just as important, we continue to execute on cost discipline. Non-fuel unit cost declined slightly, marking the third quarter in a row of cost performance below inflation and giving us good line of sight to achieving our full-year non-fuel unit cost expectations of 1%. The combination of revenue momentum and cost discipline drove a one point improvement in our pre-tax margin, a successful step in our path to improved margin performance for the full-year, and our earnings per share growth of 28% in the March quarter should be in the top 10% of companies in the S&P 500. At the heart of this performance are the Delta people, their hard work and focus on the customer is what sets Delta apart and I want to thank them and say congratulations for starting the year with $220 million towards next year\u2019s profit sharing. During the quarter, there were exciting developments in loyalty, our maintenance, repair and overhaul business and fleet that ensured we build on our earnings momentum, strengthen our strategic advantages and further diversify our revenue streams. 55% of our revenue now comes from premium products and non-ticket sources, up from less than 40% in 2011. The growing revenue streams from loyalty and our MRO are major component of the $3 billion to $4 billion in free cash flow that we except to generate this year. Our long-term agreements give us better visibility and even more confidence in the sustainability of this level of cash generation. Importantly, they are decoupled from air fares and provide stability in any economic environment. Last week, we were pleased to announce the contract renewal with American Express, extending our agreement through 2029. Delta and American Express are two great consumer brands and our shared passion for service and innovation is at the foundation of our long-term partnership. Our American Express partnership is our most important commercial relationship, and I appreciate the confidence that Steve Squeri and the rest of the AmEx team places in Delta. While our AmEx contract wasn\u2019t set to expire for several years, the early renewal accelerates momentum by providing certainty in a platform for mutual growth and investment. We except the new agreement to enable substantial growth in the Delta SkyMiles credit card portfolio, setting the stage to create not just the industry\u2019s most valuable co-brand program, but one of the most valuable consumer co-brands on the globe. Delta\u2019s benefit is expected to grow to $7 billion by 2023, up from $3.4 billion last year and just $1 billion at the start of this decade. This growth trajectory demonstrates the strength of the Delta brand and the growing attractiveness of our value proposition to our customers. As the largest MRO in North America, we also expect to generate double-digit growth, reaching more than $800 million in revenues this year, and we are growing this business by developing new capabilities and securing long-term partnerships. During the quarter, we completed construction on the world\u2019s largest engine test cell. The test cell opens the door to new larger engine testing capabilities, including those in our agreements with Rolls-Royce and with Pratt & Whitney. As we continue to invest in and grow our maintenance business, we expect the MRO top line to reach $2 billion over the next five years. And finally, we continue to transform our fleet. While we have made substantial enhancements to our fleet over the last number of years, we expect substantial efficiency benefits are still ahead for us, supporting revenue growth and contributing to Delta\u2019s sustained margin advantages. With more than 80 new deliveries this year, 2019 will be an important year for this initiative. We had a milestone this quarter with the first flights on our state-of-the-art Airbus 220. This innovative aircraft sets a new standard for the domestic narrow-body product. Our customers love it and we\u2019re finding them booking specifically to be on the Airbus 220. We have 90 deliveries of this product alone scheduled over the next several years. So 2019 is off to a real solid start. The core business performed well during the quarter, which combined with the upside from the American Express renewal, gives us increased confidence in our full-year plan of strong top line growth, margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth. Business has momentum and there are significant opportunities ahead of us. We have a strong foundation with our strategic advantages, which are our culture, our leading operational reliability, an unrivaled network, our loyalty program and relationship with American Express and an investment-grade balance sheet. These advantages combined with a great brand powered by the very best professionals in the business provide the engine to drive long-term value for our owners. Before I turn the call over to Glen and Paul, I\u2019d also like to take a minute to introduce Tim Mapes, who will become our Chief Marketing and Communications Officer starting next month. Tim has more than 25 years of experience with Delta and has been a leading force behind the Delta brand. Tim is assuming this role, because our good friend Ned Walker is heading off to a well-earned retirement. Ned, you leaved behind an incredible legacy of leadership and service to Delta and the industry, and on behalf of the entire Delta family. Thank you. And now, I will turn the call over to Glen to discuss the revenue environment. Glen Hauenstein : Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019d like to start by thanking the Delta team, the unmatched service they provided is the foundation for our increasing customer satisfaction. This enabled us to generate record revenues of $10.4 billion in the March quarter, up 7.5% over last year. We made good progress on our long-term priorities to drive top line and earnings growth by leveraging our network, premium offerings, our co-brand agreement with American Express and our Ancillary businesses. Starting with our top line, corporate revenue remained healthy, increasing 8% for the quarter. In our most recent Corporate Travel Survey, 90% of travel managers expect to maintain or increase their travel spend in the second quarter. This is a record for our June quarter survey. During the first quarter, 55% of our revenues came from premium products and non-ticket sources. Premium product revenues were up 8% to more than $3 billion in the March quarter on a 4% increase in premium capacity. Looking forward, premium revenue growth should accelerate through the year as we introduce more aircraft with the full suite of products and improve our ability to sell all of our premium products on delta.com, as well as in external channels. Cargo revenues declined 5% in the quarter similar to what you\u2019ve heard from freight companies, we are seeing challenges from softer volumes and currency headwinds. Our MRO business is performing well with revenues up nearly 40% on new customer volume and heavier work scopes from existing customers. The growth rate will moderate in the June quarter, but will still be up double digits over prior year. Total loyalty revenues grew $1.2 billion, up 21% with a little more than $100 million of the improvement driven by the new contract with American Express. Demand for SkyMiles as a currency is stronger than ever. Mileage redemptions grew 12% in the March quarter as we provided customers more opportunity to use their miles. Enhancing customer loyalty and trust is at the heart of our business, and we are finding innovative ways to reward our customers for their loyalty. Increasingly, customers are using miles for products and services beyond just award tickets as we expand miles as a form of payment. During the quarter, we rolled out miles as currency to mobile, offering SkyMiles members the opportunity to upgrade to a more premium experience through our app. We saw an overwhelmingly positive response with revenue in the March quarter already exceeding our regional full-year estimate. On average, there are already 4,000 customers upgrading with miles every day, with more than half of those transactions coming via mobile. This drove nearly 4 points of redemption growth in the quarter. Our goal is to provide customers the ability to use miles for products and services across the entire spectrum of Delta ecosystem. We plan to deliver significant additional functionality as we move through 2019. Our close relationship with American Express is a source of true competitive advantage. The co-brand credit partnership provides a unique revenue stream to Delta by extending our engagement to a broader consumer spend, not just travel on Delta. This is reflected in a new quarterly record for acquisitions of SkyMiles American Express cards. Our partnership with American Express is an increasingly important driver of our business that is growing faster than the core airline. Co-brand card spend continues to outpace the industry with double-digit growth. In 2019, our total contribution from American Express relationship will be over $4 billion, up from the $3.7 billion we previously expected. Over the next three years, we expect continued solid growth with a more significant step up starting in 2023 that will drive our total contribution to nearly $7 billion, double what we achieved last year. We expect the revenue benefit to Delta in 2019 will be approximately $500 million, driving about 1 point of unit revenue impact for the year. Turning to specifics on unit revenues. Unit revenue grew 2.4% on 5% higher capacity. Our record completion factor added 1 point of capacity in the quarter. While this was very good for our customers, our brand and our profitability, the additional capacity weighed on unit revenues by roughly 0.5 point. Even with that pressure, we are above the midpoint of our initial present guidance and the new American Express agreement has another point of benefit. Passenger unit revenues grew 0.6%, but were pressured by higher capacity, currency, Easter timing and the government shutdown. Despite these headwinds, we expect to maintain a healthy unit revenue premium to the industry of more than 110%. Domestic revenues grew 6.9% in the quarter on a roughly 1% improvement in PRASM. Growth in the business revenue outpaced leisure in the quarter with corporate revenues improving 10% on strong volumes and a 2% improvement in corporate average fares. Leisure trends were choppy, but improved as the quarter progressed. Atlantic unit revenues fell 2.6 with a 2 point headwind from currency and the Easter shift. We saw pressure on Europe, midpoint of sale leisure demand, which weighed on main cabin performance. Corporate and premium revenues were both up over prior year. In the Pacific, unit revenues declined 2.8% as strong demand was not enough to offset a 9% increase in stage and a 1 point currency headwind. Korea posted the best performance with a 2% improvement in unit revenues as our joint venture synergies continue to ramp with Korean. China revenues grew by more than 25% on a 30% higher capacity moderately pressuring unit revenue growth. Our capacity growth to China will decelerate in the second-half of the year, as we annualize the additional flights added to the market during 2018. In Latin, revenues grew 2.4%, the second consecutive quarter of positive unit revenue growth, driven by improving demand and yield trends in Mexico and the Caribbean. Looking forward, June quarter total revenue is expected to increase 6% to 8%, including 1 point of benefit from the agreement with American Express. We expect unit revenue growth of 1.5% to 3.5% on a 4% to 4.5% higher capacity. In domestic, corporate demand is strong. Leisure continues to strengthen as we approach the second quarter peak demand. We expect Atlantic to return to unit revenue growth as demand shifts to U.S. point of origin in the summer season and corporate trend remains strong. In the Pacific, currency capacity growth in stage will continue to pressure unit revenues in the June quarter, but we see profitability continuing to improve as we execute on our long-term vision for Asia. Our fleet is becoming more efficient, our product is improving, we have the right partners and with these building blocks in place we have returned to growth for the first time in seven years. Performance is on track or exceeding our expectations. Latin is expected to remain the best performing entity as strength continues in Mexico, the Caribbean and Brazil improves. We expect Brazil to show year-over-year RASM improvement in the June quarter for the first time in the year. Sequentially in the June quarter, we expect a 1 point improvement in passenger revenue per ASM with sequential improvement in all entities. On a traveling basis, however, this improvement will be somewhat tempered by other revenue pressure due to lower growth rates in Ancillary business. Importantly, our passenger unit trajectory in the back-half of the year, the rate of domestic capacity, I\u2019m sorry, excuse me \u2013 importantly, for our passenger unit revenue trajectory in the back-half of the year, the rate of domestic capacity growth is expected to decelerate by approximately 2 points. This gives us increased confidence in our full-year unit revenue trajectory. As we think about our network opportunities, we have leveraged our first mover advantage to build our number one or number two positions in our coastal gateways. Later this year, we\u2019ve been begin refocusing our growth into our higher-margin core hubs to more efficient, larger gauge aircraft. We continue to increase our scale while maintaining our revenue premium and improving our margins. With about a point of incremental capacity driven by our record operating performance and increased gauge and stage length, we now see our full-year 2019 capacity outlook to be in a 3% to 4% range. However, we\u2019re always mindful of our operating environment and we will take the necessary actions we see, we need to do, if we see sustained higher fuel prices or economic uncertainty impacting our margin expansion. The slightly higher capacity combined with $500 million in additional revenue from benefit from American Express renewal support total revenue growth of 5% to 7% in 2019, up from the 46% initial guidance given at Investor Day. In closing, the strength of the March quarter results and the contract renewal with American Express further reinforce the confidence and conviction we have in both our near-term and long-term strategy. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to my good friend, Paul. Paul Jacobson : Thank you, Glen, and good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. At our Investor Day, we reiterated our commitment to consistently delivering superior financial results. For us, this is about creating value through top line growth, margin expansion and free cash flow generation through prudent capital allocation. Our March quarter results provided a solid start to the year across each of these priorities and give us increased confidence in our full-year outlook. This is the first quarter we have expanded margins on both in operating and pre-tax basis in nearly two years. Our March quarter operating margin of 10% is a 1.5 higher than last year and flat to 2017, despite market fuel prices that are approximately 20% higher this year. For the March quarter, our non-fuel unit cost declined 0.1 point, marking another quarter of strong cost performance. This was better than our initial guidance due to record operations that resulted in about a point of additional capacity, some shifts in expense timing to the second and third quarter and continued good cost control momentum throughout the organization carrying forward from the second-half of last year. Fuel prices are trending higher, so maintaining a disciplined cost trajectory is a top priority for us as we continue to drive to full-year margin expansion. I want to thank the entire Delta team for their continued commitments in this effort. For the June quarter, we expect non-fuel unit cost growth of 1% to 2%. It is important to note that with the efficiency gains we\u2019ve made through our fleet transformation, we expect to accelerate the retirement of our MD-90 fleet. Our June quarter cost guidance includes about a point \u2013 about 0.5 of impact for this decision. Our results combined with our ongoing fleet transformation and work through One Delta keep us on track to achieve our target of 1% non-fuel unit cost growth in 2019. This year is important for us in our fleet transformation journey. We are optimizing how we deploy our existing fleet through One Delta, continuing to retire older aircraft with nearly 40 MD-88s exiting the fleet this year and introducing next-generation engine technology with two new aircraft types. These new aircrafts generate substantial efficiency benefits and enable revenue growth, both through higher premium seat mix, as well as improved customer satisfaction, supporting our industry-leading revenue premium and margin advantage. In February, we launched the A220. By the end of the year, we will have 28 of these aircraft, growing this fleet to 90 aircraft by 2023. A220 deliveries enable retirement of smaller regional aircraft, the least efficient and highest-cost aircraft in our fleet. We are also the North American launch customer for the A330900 Neo. This aircraft will join our fleet this summer, enabling more efficient flying in the Pacific with a best-in-class product that is expected to generate a 5 to 10 point margin improvement versus the aircraft it is replacing. New engine technology aircraft also give us the ability to structurally shift our cost curve down, while gaining benefits from higher gauge and a better product. Our order book allows for replacement of 35% of our mainline fleet through 2023, allowing us to continue to optimize as simplification and efficiency benefits drive further margin improvements. Total fuel expense increased $87 million in the quarter versus prior year. Refinery profits were pressured due to lower gas crack spreads driving a loss of $34 million, or about $0.04 per gallon in the quarter. For the June quarter, we expect our all-in fuel price to be $2.10 to $2.20 per gallon, in line with last year and up modestly from the March quarter. These results include a slight profit at the refinery for the quarter. Importantly, our re-fleeting and One Delta initiatives drove a 2.1% improvement in fuel efficiency during the March quarter, doubled the rate we saw in the same quarter last year and indicative of the efficiency we expect to generate in 2019, furthering our environmental sustainability goals and lowering our costs. Non-operating expenses for the quarter were $69 million higher than prior year due to pension pressure and lower equity partner earnings, each of which are expected to repeat in the quarter. Looking to the June quarter, expect the top line growth of 6% to 8%, combined with 1% to 2% growth in our non-fuel unit costs and a slight moderation in fuel prices over prior year supports our expectation for continued margin expansion and another quarter of double-digit EPS growth. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.35, up more than 20% versus prior year at the midpoint and well above S&P earnings growth expectations. This equates to a pre-tax margin of 14% to 16%, compared to last year\u2019s results of 14.1%. Turning to cash flow in the balance sheet, we generated $2 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter, with improvement over prior year on higher profits and timing of our voluntary pension contribution. We reinvested in the business with $1.3 billion in CapEx, resulting in free cash flow of $760 million. The March quarter result and incremental benefit from AmEx give us increasing confidence in achieving the high-end of our full-year free cash flow guidance of $3 billion to $4 billion, compared to $2.3 billion last year. In fact, we expect to produce nearly that level in the first-half of this year alone. For the full-year, our free cash flow conversion is expected to approve to around 80% of net income, with tailwinds from strong top line growth included the \u2013 including the added benefit from American Express and an improved cost trajectory. This is up 33% from an average of around 60% each of the last two years. Our strong cash generation and a healthy balance sheet enable us to consistently return cash back to our owners. With the confidence this management team has in the sustainability of Delta\u2019s earnings power, market volatility created an opportunity to accelerate our buyback plans within the year. We repurchased $1.3 billion in stock at an average price of $50.55, retiring 26 million shares in the quarter, while also paying out $233 million in dividends. Our repurchases were funded by a $1 billion seasonal working capital loan, $300 million of which we have already repaid. The remainder is expected to be repaid by the end of this year. We still expect to return approximately $2.5 billion to shareholders in 2019 through dividends and buybacks, and remain staunchly committed to returning 70% of free cash flow to shareholders annually. In the first week of April, we contributed $250 million of our voluntary pension funding for the year and we expect to contribute the remaining $250 million later this year. Leveraging our strong balance sheet, we recently refinanced $500 million of scheduled debt maturities. The completion of our $500 million EETC, refinance is approximately one-third of our 2019 scheduled maturities at a 3.2% blended rate, saving us approximately $9 million annually on our interest expense. With debt levels comfortably within our leverage ratio target of 1.5 to 2.5 times adjusted debt to EBITDAR, we will continue to utilize a variety of funding sources to refinance debt maturities or take advantage of market conditions and refinance higher cost debt. Our after-tax return on invested capital on a trailing 12-month basis is 14.5%. This is up nearly 200 basis points over prior year on improved profitability and tax reform benefits. We are on track to deliver a 15% after-tax ROIC in 2019, consistent with our expectations at Investor Day. Looking forward, we have solid momentum and are on track to deliver strong top line growth, margin expansion and double-digit EPS growth for the full-year. This performance is a validation of our commitment to reinforcing the Delta difference. The combination of our powerful brand and our unmatched competitive advantages continue to deliver industry-leading results and will drive long-term value for our owners. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Jill to begin the Q&A. Jill Greer : Thanks, Paul. Jake, we\u2019re ready for questions from the analysts. If you could give them instructions on how to get in the queue. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will hear first from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Joseph DeNardi : Hey, good morning. Ed, in 2018, you guys received $3.5 billion in cash from the selling miles and reported about a $1.5 billion in marketing fee. You\u2019re on track for $2 billion in 2020. If you can get to $7 billion in 2023, you\u2019ll be doing $3 billion to $4 billion in marketing fee. How could you possibly not break that out as a separate business unit, not talking about spinning it or selling it, just segmenting out. What are your thoughts there? Ed Bastian : Well, my thoughts are it\u2019s a good problem to worry about, Joe. We are \u2013 first of all, we\u2019re pleased and thrilled with the new renewal. AmEx is an awesome partner, and our two brands line up so well strategically and with our customers and our people. As we grow our loyalty program, you\u2019re right, there will be a question of disclosure in terms of providing better insight from an ownership perspective and a governance perspective into the drivers of our profitability into the future and whether that\u2019s in a segment or whatever disclosure form, I\u2019m not sure what it will take. But it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been giving greater disclosure to as you know, and we will continue to consider that. Joseph DeNardi : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then Glen, just \u2013 or Ed, if you could just talk around some of the assumptions behind getting to the $7 billion, it seems to imply continued really strong growth in card acquisitions and spend on the card. So what gives you the confidence that you can continue to do that? And then Glen, you mentioned there\u2019s another significant step up in 2023. So I mean, can you talk about what the total value of the agreement could reach by the end of it? Glen Hauenstein : Well, we continue to see it grow significantly beyond 2023. And really one of the great reasons that we have for accelerating the renewal of the contract is that we can continue to invest in new products and services for consumers that we think will make the card relatively more and more attractive and drive continued acquisition. And that was really one of the main reasons to go ahead and do that at this point in time. So we are excited about the future of that. As I pointed out in the earnings call, we did have another record acquisition in the script. We had another record acquisition quarter in the first quarter. And as we start up the second quarter, acquisitions remain very strong, and I think if we can continue to provide the kind of value to customers that they want to acquire the card, which we have a great plan for with American Express we will meet or exceed those expectations by 2023 and beyond. Joseph DeNardi : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll now move to a question from Joe Caiado with Credit Suisse. Joe Caiado : Hey, thanks very much. Good morning. Ed and Paul, you\u2019re generating a lot of cash flow this year, that was already the case prior to the renewal of the AmEx agreement, the outlook for cash flows now even better. Two-part question here. I know you\u2019re committed to returning 70% of free cash flow to shareholders, but you\u2019ve also gone above that level periodically. So I\u2019m curious how you\u2019re thinking about prioritizing the deployment of that incremental cash flow that you\u2019re getting this year? And then the second part of question is, Ed, since you talked about the confidence this gives you and the sustainability of your cash flow I\u2019m curious if you have a target for annual free cash flow conversion going forward? Paul Jacobson : Well, good morning, Joe. I\u2019ll start with that and Ed can follow-up. Obviously, the American Express agreement provides us with increasing confidence about our performance throughout the year and in part helps to convey that confidence through my comments about coming in at the top-end of the free cash flow range for the year. It is still early in the year and we are facing increasing prices and we\u2019re cautiously optimistic about that. We have said with the announcement of the first quarter buyback acceleration that we maintain the optionality to give back more. So consistent return of capital back to shareholders is obviously a big priority for us, and we expect to continue that into the future. Ed Bastian : Joe, to add on to Paul\u2019s comments, I agree with him. I think it\u2019s a great start to the year. We\u2019re excited with how the first quarter came, but I think it\u2019s still early to be raising full-year expectations whether it\u2019s in guidance or for profitability, EPS or cash flow. We do face a lot of volatility in oil prices. And while demand has been solid, I\u2019d like to at least get through the second quarter before reassessing those full-year expectations. So from my perspective, I\u2019d say, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic. We\u2019ll be in the top half of the guidance range that we gave you, both on EPS, as well as on free cash, but we\u2019re not ready to raise those ranges or expectations right at this moment. Joe Caiado : That\u2019s fair, I appreciate that. And then I have \u2013 second question if I may for Glen. I just want to get your thoughts kind of big picture on the booking curve and what you\u2019re seeing. It feels like perhaps we\u2019re seeing some more heavy discounting on longer-dated bookings, but better close and offsetting, just love your thoughts there? Thanks. Glen Hauenstein : I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what we see at all. As a matter of fact forward yields for every month out through the second quarter are in positive territory on higher bookings. So we see relatively robust leisure demand as we enter the second quarter. Joe Caiado : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : Good morning. Ed Bastian : Good morning. Hunter Keay : Hey, Ed, putting aside the issues Boeing\u2019s current issues of the MAX, how does the potential aftermarket work and your relationship with the engine OEMs factor into how you\u2019re thinking about buying the NMA? Ed Bastian : Well, I\u2019d say, it\u2019s premature to be speculating on the NMA. It\u2019s \u2013 Boeing has not even approved the release of it for sale. So I think we\u2019re a little early here. We are \u2013 we consider all components of the aircraft and the revenues and the opportunities that it brings. As we evaluate a new fleet family, it was an important consideration in making decision on the 321 Neo, which product we went to with the Geared Turbofan, as well as the MRO benefits that provided. It will certainly be in the consideration side as we think about the NMA, but I think trying to get down to that level of speculation probably is way too early. Hunter Keay : Okay. And then how does the AmEx agreement factor into how you view the lifecycle of the customer? Is there a construct where you\u2019re willing to subsidize a few years of price sensitive consumption of fares or even losses or low margins to potentially strategic customers in exchange for like a 25 to 50-year long-term relationship with increasing spend as that customer builds wealth? Ed Bastian : Well, I \u2013 yes, that\u2019s a question obviously for AmEx, as well as for us. We are \u2013 when we think about AmEx and our relationship, we think for the very long-term, we don\u2019t think in terms of contract periods and renewal extensions. AmEx \u2013 one of the real attractive components to AmEx is the presence it has and the opportunity it creates in some of our high-value segments. So, yes, if you\u2019re asking, \u201cDo we invest in acquiring high-value potential customers early in their life?\u201d Absolutely. And it\u2019s one of the reasons, I think, our brands aligned so well, because we have similar strategies in terms of how we think about our brands and how we think about consumers. Hunter Keay : Very good. Thank you. Operator : And I will hear from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just to come back to AmEx for a second, can you comment on the underlying drivers of that $7 billion contribution by 2023. How much of that is contractual rate? How much of that is customer spend, and how much of that is new customer acquisition, if you would? Ed Bastian : Duane, we are under contract confidentiality obviously with American Express that you can appreciate. I can tell you with all of the above. And as we get further into the new contract, I think, some of those \u2013 your questions will start to answer themselves. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay, we\u2019ll wait for that to be revealed. And then, Glen, you touched on mobile briefly. Can you talk about mobile more broadly? What does it represent as a percentage of your bookings today? How large is that revenue stream, and how quickly is it growing? Glen Hauenstein : Mobile is by far the fastest growing, and it\u2019s about 20% of our direct bookings \u2013 20% to 25% of our direct bookings. And it seems like every week and every month it moves on, mobile becomes a bigger and bigger chunk of total bookings. So that\u2019s really the place that we see an incredible amount of growth and that\u2019s where consumers are seeming to want to go in order to book delta.com, they will book directly with Delta. So very exciting and we have lots of great new releases coming this year, which we think will continue to enhance that customer experience with more and more utility that you can have in the palm of your hand. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thank you very much. Operator : Helane Becker with Cowen will have the next question. Helane Becker : Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody, and thank you very much for the time. Just on the MRO business, you said it was $800 million in revenue this year and you want to grow it to $2 billion over some timeframe going forward. Can you just talk about the CapEx that you need to get to that level, or with the new large test cell, is that built out now? Ed Bastian : Well, Helane, the good news in that is a lot of the growth that we need is now contractually provided for with our relationships with Rolls-Royce on the Trent, as well as on the Pratt & Whitney in the geared turbofan. As those products come to market, the geared turbofan is still early in its introduction, as well as the new \u2013 from the new trend products, you will see that the revenue ramp towards the back-end of that period at a higher clip than you\u2019ll see in the front part of that five-year period. This year, we\u2019re doing well. We\u2019re looking for double-digit growth top line, as well as margin improvement from the MRO, but it really starts to take off pardon the pun over the next couple of years. Helane Becker : Okay. That\u2019s really helpful, thank you. It\u2019s okay I get the puns, too. Just as \u2013 when you think about solo \u2013 I want to ask this question, but you\u2019re not going to really answer the whole question, because your \u2013 you started negotiating with your pilots. And when you think about your go-forward CapEx and the growth of the airline, the replacement cycle and so on, how do you manage their expectations in terms of growing the non-ticket revenue or main cabin revenue, that\u2019s 45% of your total revenue with what their demands are for what they expect their future income to be? Ed Bastian : Well, you\u2019re right. We\u2019re not going to talk about our discussions with our pilots. We have just begun and it\u2019s going to take quite sometime to reach a productive conclusion. When we think about our company, we think about all the constituents that are important to our company; all of our employees, not just our pilots that they will create the opportunity and the value that we\u2019ve already created and as well as the future. We think about the investment needs that we have to make, continued in our product, in our growth. We think about the investments we need to make in our customers, investments we need to make in our communities, as well as the investments we need to continue to make in our owners. So in that context, I\u2019m certain we\u2019ll reach a good and fair conclusion of our pilot negotiations, but it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re not going to do it publicly and it\u2019s more premature to even begin to speculate on any construct there. Helane Becker : Okay. That\u2019s totally fair. Thanks for your help. Have a nice day. Ed Bastian : Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from David Vernon with Bernstein. David Vernon : Hey, good morning, guys. Maybe Glen or Ed, could you just kind of talk in simple terms like what Delta actually needs to do to get this incremental sort of $3.5 billion of revenue? Is this just a function of pricing on a mileage basis, the new card issue? Could you kind of break through the drivers of what actually Delta needs to do to kind of secure this revenue benefit? Ed Bastian : Dave, it\u2019s a good try. I\u2019ll give you the same answer I gave last time. We\u2019re under confidentiality and we can\u2019t give you those specific drivers in terms of \u2013 but it is all the above. Obviously, we\u2019re going to be investing alongside AmEx in new cardholder, not just acquisitions, but development in terms of spend and portfolio size and range and the opportunities to expand in that regard. Economics of the card obviously have improved itself in terms of coming back to Delta. So let\u2019s say, those are a couple of the main drivers. David Vernon : Yes, I mean, I guess, its just trying to \u2013 it\u2019s hard to sort of handicap the certain new looks to put in \u2013 put that number to a model without really kind of understanding the drivers of kind of\u2026 Ed Bastian : Let me \u2013 yes, let me suggest that we have pretty good optimism on getting to the $7 billion in that timeframe we gave. David Vernon : Okay, all right. And maybe just as a follow-up topic on a different subject. Transatlantic, when you mentioned that Europe is looking like it\u2019s firming up a little bit as we get into the summer months. There\u2019s a lot of speculation that there\u2019s going to be some new capacity added into that Transatlantic market. Can you talk a little bit about kind of Delta\u2019s experience in \u2013 on the yield curve when other sort of low-cost entrants maybe kind of came into that Transatlantic market and help us think through what some of the puts and takes for Delta could be if we do hear an announcement that another carrier maybe flying the Transatlantic soon? Ed Bastian : Well, as you know, we\u2019ve faced and have faced significant competition from low-fare and ultra low-fare carriers in the Transatlantic for quite sometime, so this is not something new. And we\u2019re sitting in a very good position we think with our partnerships in the Transatlantic and with our core products and services that will continue to improve over the next months and years, so we feel very secure. And as you look at Transatlantic capacity, there are always new entrants coming and there are always entrants leaving, if you will. So we\u2019ll see what the supply and demand balance is, but we\u2019ve had a very good couple of years in the Transatlantic and we expect that to continue. David Vernon : But did you see material impact as sort of maybe Norwegian came into the market a few years ago or was it sort of part of the noise? Ed Bastian : As you know, last year was one of the best years we\u2019ve had in many years in the Transatlantic, and this year is shaping up to be another great year. So I think the data points would suggest that we\u2019re in a very good spot. David Vernon : All right. I appreciate the added color. Thanks, guys. Operator : Next question will come from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Jamie Baker : Hi, thanks. Good morning, everybody. Glen, sort of an arcane one to start. Could you give us a summary of interline agreements with U.S. and Canadian competitors? I realize it\u2019s a small part of the business. But to the extent that MAX cancellations continue, it would help to understand which airlines can send passengers over to you also if and when somebody does, is the fare you receive what the passenger paid fare was or is it something more akin to like a ID75 off your full fare? Glen Hauenstein : Yes, I don\u2019t think we want to disclose the details of our interline agreements with our partners. But it is not the fare that the customers paid, we\u2019ll say that and we do have interline agreements with the two major US carriers that are our competitors and that\u2019s \u2013 two or the three that are experiencing those small cancellations. Jamie Baker : Right. Glen Hauenstein : I think now most of them have taken those out, so they are trying to get proactive and get way ahead of the re-accommodation, so we don\u2019t expect a significant number of day of departure re-accommodations from them. Jamie Baker : Okay. And second, probably for Ed or Paul, on AmEx, how far ahead of the industry curve do you think that Delta is with the new terms, or actually \u2013 no, no, no, I\u2019ll scratch that, because I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll answer, let me try it differently. If you were to rank the contributions to your margin premium, so if you rank the contributors to the margin premium and I gave you the categories of loyalty economics, domestic RASM premium, MRO, fleet and CASM, would those be the top 5? And what would be descending order of contribution be? Again, those categories are loyalty, RASM premium, MRO, fleet and CASM, you have 30 seconds. Ed Bastian : It sounds like a 30-minute game show, Jamie. Listen, we are \u2013 we were clear in our comments that we \u2013 this contract extension will lead us to our goal of being not just the most valuable card in the industry, but one of the most valuable cards in consumer cards in the world. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re number one at this moment. As we sit here within our industry, though I certainly expect over the next \u2013 the next few years, we should be number one. Relative ranking, I\u2019d have to give some thought to how you\u2019d want to \u2013 what kind of cost you like to allocate to all those revenue categories that you gave us. Jamie Baker : Okay. I guess, we\u2019ll send you home with the home version of the board game then. I appreciate the answers all the same. Thank you, everybody. Ed Bastian : Take care, Jamie. Jamie Baker : Take care. Operator : Now, we\u2019ll move to a question from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Mike Linenberg : Hey, good morning, everyone. Hey, just two quick ones here. Hey, Ed, on the MRO, I recall a time, it was a few years back when Delta used to provide on a segment basis the profitability of your MRO, and I think the margins \u2013 operating margins were in the mid-teens. Is that consistent with the profitability of that business today? Ed Bastian : Yes, it is. Mike Linenberg : Okay, great. And then, just my second question and Ed, this is back to you. Just the headlines out about, possibility of tariffs on Airbus equipment. Would there be a distinction, if you know, for Airbus or aircraft may be narrow body aircraft coming out of Alabama, you know, that are built by American workers, any thoughts on that? I know it\u2019s early. Ed Bastian : Well, I don\u2019t know, Mike. You know obviously, the aircraft that we\u2019re going to be taking next year out of mobile, you would think would be \u2013 should be exempt from a potential tariff issue. Mike Linenberg : Yes. Ed Bastian : But we\u2019ll wait and see. Mike Linenberg : All right. All right, great thanks. Jill Greer : Okay. We\u2019re going to have time for one more question from the analysts. Operator : And that question will come from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Dan McKenzie : Okay, good morning. Thanks guys. You know going back to the use of free cash flow this year, you know, Delta has done strategic investments really well. And without comment to what you may or may not do, I wonder if you can at least comment on whether there are any interesting opportunities that you\u2019re currently evaluating. Ed Bastian : Such as? Dan McKenzie : Strategic investment perhaps and, you know, another partner or at least a bigger investment in an existing partner? Ed Bastian : Dan, as you know, we\u2019re not going to speculate on future strategic investments on the call. The one that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s out there that we have indicated we\u2019re discussions with is Alitalia and I \u2013 you know, I\u2019ve confirmed that several times publicly that we are talking to the rail system of Italy FS, as well as with the Alitalia. Leadership in the Italian government about potentially making an investment, but it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s not the size that I think we\u2019d wanted us to, you know, getting into a discussion of what that means for our use of free cash flow. I think that will \u2013 that will be an investment that\u2019s somewhat limited and we\u2019ll spend \u2013 we certainly haven\u2019t made a decision in terms of climbing on that. Dan McKenzie : Understood. Second question is, you know, regarding the move to probably maintain the full-year EPS, you know, there is some macro noise around Brexit partly and some lower growth worries out of Europe, and, you know, I appreciate the positive revenue commentary on the Atlantic, you know, but on the UK piece of this, you know, what are you seeing today and, you know, can you just remind us what the UK component is to the overall revenue pie here just, you know, given the JVs? Glen Hauenstein : Well, UK is about 20% to 25% if you include the virgin piece, and much less for us, and what we\u2019re seeing is actually fairly decent summer travel to the UK both in business and in coach, so we have \u2013 the second quarter, we\u2019re expecting UK unit revenues to be flat to up slightly. And so, while we have waited for years for the impact of Brexit on air travel, it has not yet materialized, and we\u2019ll keep a close eye on it and if we have to make adjustments, we will, but, you know, I think there is so much uncertainty around what it actually is, hard for us to action it at this time. Ed Bastian : And to be clear on Glen\u2019s comments that 20% to 25% is [at the] Transatlantic JV not at Delta, so it was obviously a much smaller part of Delta. Dan McKenzie : Yes, understood. Okay thanks for the time you guys. Jill Greer : That\u2019s going to wrap up the analyst portion of the call. Before we turn it over to media, I just want to say behalf of the entire IR team that you have been a fantastic partner for us. Ed Bastian : Hey, thank you very much Jill. Jill Greer : We look forward working with him and we\u2019d been lucky to work with and learn from one of the best. Now, we\u2019ll hand it over to the media team. Ed Bastian : Great, Jill. If we could as we transition to the questions and answers from members of the media, if you\u2019d wouldn\u2019t mind just repeating the instructions and the reminder that we just like to keep the questions themselves as succinct and short as possible with one follow-up to allow us to get to as many of these as we possibly could. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll hear first from David Koenig with The Associated Press. David Koenig : Hi, thanks for giving me this chance. I did have a question and a follow-up to one of the analyst questions on the Max cancellations and the interline agreements. Are those customers coming over on interline agreements? You know, how profitable are those? And I\u2019ll include my follow-up here, did you have any forecast status to how many additional passengers you might see because of Max related cancellations at your other airlines? Ed Bastian : David, this is Ed. We \u2013 you know, it\u2019s \u2013 the Max, it represents a really small part of our industry\u2019s market share at this point, and we\u2019re not going to get into any specific details relative to the interline arrangements we have with some of our partners that maybe flying that product. David Koenig : Does that mean you do not expect many passengers to come over on those? Ed Bastian : I would expect the numbers are not going to be material to Delta. David Koenig : Okay. Okay, thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll now hear from Tracy Rucinski with Reuters. Tracy Rucinski : Hi, you indicated that the size any Alitalia stake would be limited. How large of a stake is Delta willing to take and what has held up a deal so far? Ed Bastian : We are not going to speculate on either the size of our investment other than what we\u2019ve already said, or the time it\u2019s going to take to bring that to a conclusion. Operator : Anything further Tracy? Tracy Rucinski : No, that\u2019s it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Moving to Edward Russell with Flight Global. Edward Russell : Yes. Paul you mentioned that Delta is accelerating the retirement of the MD-90s. Could you outline how \u2013 when does Delta plan to remove the MD-90 fleet? Paul Jacobson : Well, what I mentioned in my comments is that we\u2019re considering that we expect to make that announcement in the quarter at which point we can provide more details on exact timing, replacement, etcetera. Edward Russell : Okay. And then, a second question on premium products. What is \u2013 how is Delta viewing \u2013 I mean shrinking your business cabins on some of your new aircraft, the 777 200, I mean how do you view premium demand when you\u2019re \u2013 you know, for upfront cabin that are shrinking on these light bodies? Ed Bastian : So, we don\u2019t look at it as reducing the number of premium seats because we\u2019re introducing an entirely new cabin on the airplane, so what we\u2019re trying to do is best match the consumer demand with the products and services that we have. So, if you look at the total premium seats on those airplanes, they\u2019re actually increasing as we introduce Delta Premium Select to the international marketplace and that will be complete, but on all of the international light bodies by 2021, and we\u2019re very excited with the initial returns that customers are selecting that. I think when we look back at what customers wanted to buy from us years back, we had coach and then we had a flight bed and there were so many opportunities to satisfy consumer demands in between. So now having all five cabins available I think we feel very comfortable with the size of each one of those. Edward Russell : Thank you very much. Glen Hauenstein : Jake, we have time for one final question please. Operator : And that last question will come from Elliott Blackburn with Argus Media. Elliott Blackburn : Good morning and thanks. I squeeze in again. I just hope to get an update on the progress Delta has made on efforts to trying to partner at the Trainer refinery? Ed Bastian : Sure. We -- you know, as we as stated in January, we continued to work through that. That is a \u2013 it\u2019s been a long process because it\u2019s been a complex one. We still do that. We have no update to that guidance at this point. Elliott Blackburn : And I guess if there is any kind of outlook you can give on, you know, the role of that refinery within Delta going forward. Does it take on any greater or lesser importance as we see kind of forecast for higher distillate prices next year and kind of a general rising jet fuel environment? What\u2019s kind of your longer-term outlook on the facility? Ed Bastian : Sure. The refinery has always been a strong asset for Delta and the process that we outlined was in an effort to try to find ways to strategically enhance that value to Delta. But as we look at both the forward curves out \u2013 in the out years, the potential prospects of increased prices of jet fuel as it relates to IMO 2020, there\u2019s obviously a forward view of profitability at that refinery which will serve as a very effective counter effect to increasing fuel prices, not only the direct production from the refinery, but also the fact that we\u2019ve been able to use that production to lower our prices throughout the country and throughout all the sites where we purchase jet fuel has created a sustainable advantage for Delta and we don\u2019t expect that to change under any circumstance. Elliott Blackburn : Thanks very much Jill Greer : With that, I would like to close by thanking everybody for their time today, particularly thanking everybody for their time today, particularly thanking Ed, Glen, and Paul for their comments. I\u2019d add my personal thanks to Ned for his help during these weeks of transition and thank everyone again for your time and we will see you on July 11 for second quarter. Operator : And everyone that does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation today.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jill Greer : Thanks, Jake. Good morning, and thanks to everyone for joining us on our June quarter earnings call. Joining us from Atlanta today are our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Paul Jacobson. Our entire leadership team is here in the room for the Q&A session. Ed will open the call and give an overview of Delta\u2019s performance, Glen will then address the revenue environment, and Paul will conclude with the review of our cost performance and cash flow. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up. Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta\u2019s SEC filings. We\u2019ll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the IR page at ir.delta.com. And with that, here\u2019s Ed. Ed Bastian : Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Our record June quarter financial and operating results demonstrate The Delta Difference in action. We\u2019re translating our powerful brands, unmatched competitive advantages and pipeline of initiatives to drive earnings growth, margin expansion and solid returns for our owners. Earlier today, we reported a June quarter pre-tax profit of $2 billion with earnings increasing 32% to $2.35 per share. We expanded operating margins by more than 2 points and generated $1.8 billion in free cash flow. We continue to run the best operation in the global industry by far. To-date, we\u2019ve achieved 82 days without a single cancellation across the Delta system, a 26% improvement over last year\u2019s record performance. And for our mainline product, we\u2019ve already reached 153 days without a cancellation. This reliability combined with the great service our people provide is translating to more customers than ever choosing Delta. As a result, we ran the highest load factors in our history and flew a record 53.9 million passengers in the June quarter. And even with these record volumes, this was the first time in our history that Delta had zero involuntary denied boardings for an entire quarter. This strong demand drove an 8.7% improvement in our topline and total revenue of $12.5 billion, which marked the highest quarterly result in our history, and our momentum continues to build. We experienced five of the top ten revenue days in our history just over the last 30 days. With our people consistently delivering best-in-class travel experiences for our customers, we are seeing our net promoter scores reach new heights and our brand affinity growth. We have the world\u2019s most valuable airline brands, one that\u2019s mentioned not just among the best global airlines but also alongside top consumer brands. The essence of our brand is a sign of the trust and preference we\u2019re earning from our customers through operational excellence and unmatched service. Our people are the very best in the business and they are Delta's strongest competitive advantage. They keep climbing, improving year-after-year because our customers count on us to connect them to moments that matter around the world every day. And not only do they serve our customers, but they continue to get back to the communities where they live, work and serve. Earlier this week, Delta was recognized by the American Red Cross as the number one corporate blood donor in the country for the second year in a row. This is a fantastic accomplishment. And I want to say congratulations and thank them for their service. So far this year, we have accrued $739 million towards next Valentine\u2019s Day profit sharing. Across the business, we are harnessing Delta's strength and quality and innovation to drive improvements in the customer experience, stronger customer loyalty and profitable global growth. Delta's financial foundation and cash generation are allowing us to sustainably invest across the business at a level no competitor can match. During the first half of the year, we generated $2.5 billion in free cash flow, more than what we produced in all of 2018, positioning us to achieve $4 billion in free cash flow in 2019. We are investing for the future to ensure that our customer experience and brand continue to elevate while ensuring our employees have the right tools to continue to provide best-in-class customer service. One example is the transformation of our domestic narrow-body fleet, which is exciting, and Glen will cover the substantial benefits we expect this to deliver to our customers as well as to our owners. On the airport front, we'll invest over $12 billion in terminal facilities that are key hubs over the next five years. This fall, we will achieve a major milestone in New York as we open Concourse G, the first of four new Delta concourses included in our $3.9 billion project at LaGuardia. By taking control of the construction process, we've been able to build a more efficient facility focused on meeting the needs of our customers, and by utilizing our investment-grade balance sheet that facility will have a long-term competitive cost advantage. We're also making meaningful investments in our customer-facing technology. Delta.com is one of the top e-commerce sites in the U.S. and we continue to add functionality, not only to our site but also to our Fly Delta app. These are our fastest growing distribution channels with the highest customer satisfaction as more customers are choosing to interact directly with us. Our technology investments are helping us deliver more customized offers and enabling our employees to further differentiate our level of service. Through our single view of the customer technology stream, we are increasingly personalizing interactions, celebrating milestones and engaging with our customers through their preferred channels as we deepen our customer relationships. We're also continuing to enhance our onboard experience. We just announced that starting in November, we will launch an industry-leading, reinvented international Main Cabin experience that will make every customer feel even more valued. We are also taking steps to provide more options for spending time in-flight. During the quarter, we took the first steps towards bringing free Wi-Fi to life by completing a two-week test, and we'll conduct more testing in the months ahead to create an experience customers prefer. We are committed to providing the best in-flight entertainment in the sky. It will be another point of differentiation. And finally, as part of the foundation for a global franchise, we have built $2 billion equity portfolio of strategic partners. The most recent addition was our 4.3% investment in Hanjin KAL, a largest shareholder of Korean Air. We intend to increase our stake to 10%, pending regulatory approval. This investment supports the stability and growth of our joint venture with Korean, an important piece of our long-term Pacific strategies. So, in summary, we\u2019re executing well, and we have confidence in our continued momentum. As a result, we are raising our full-year earnings guide to $6.75 to $7.25 per share, which is a 25% improvement over last year\u2019s EPS. We also announced the Board\u2019s decision to raise our quarterly dividend by 15% to $0.4025 per share. This is the sixth year in a row that we\u2019ve increased the dividend and this increase represents a 2.7% yield at yesterday\u2019s price. Importantly, it demonstrates the sustainability of the Delta business model and our shareholder-friendly capital allocation strategy. We\u2019ve also raised our total shareholder return expectations for 2019 to $3 billion on the strength of our free cash flow results and our expectations for the rest of this year. The business has positive momentum with significant opportunity ahead. We have a durable foundation of strategic advantages, our culture, leading operational reliability and unrivaled network, our loyalty program and relationship with American Express and an investment grade balance sheet. These advantages combined with a great brand powered by the very best people in the business provide the engine to drive meaningful long-term value for our customers, our employees and our owners. And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Glen and Paul to discuss the details of the quarter. Glen Hauenstein : Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019d like to start by thanking the Delta team. Exceptional operational performance and unmatched service our people provide are the reason why more customers than ever are choosing to fly Delta. Their hard work enabled a record revenue quarter with a $1 billion increase over the prior year. The 8.7% growth in the June quarter is the seventh consecutive quarter of topline growth of 7% or more, a level that is more than 2 times GDP. Demand for Delta remains strong, both our onboard products and our SkyMiles currency. Our investment in products, airport service and reliability are reshaping customer perception and driving record satisfaction scores. This increasing brand affinity supports our revenue premium to the industry which remains at more than a 110%. Premium product revenues were up 10% to more than $4 billion, 7% increase in premium capacity. With more customers choosing these products and improved distribution, premium paid load factors increased by 3 points year-over-year. The loyalty revenues grew 19% to $1.2 billion including a roughly $100 million benefit from the American Express contract renewal announced in April. Our loyalty program and relationship with American Express are key drivers of our business and remain sources of true long-term competitive advantage. New acquisitions of SkyMiles members this year are on track to increase at a rate double that of just three years ago, and more and more of our members are signing up for the SkyMiles American Express cards. But most importantly, customer satisfaction among our loyalty members is at record levels. During the quarter, spend on our co-brand cards and mileage uses, both increased double digits. More customers are using Miles as currency to upgrade their experience post purchase. This new functionality has been very well received and is exceeding our expectations with over 0.5 million members using this option since launch earlier this year. Both leisure and business travel demand remained robust and have improved relative to the March quarter. The shift in Easter to April and peak summer travel season contributed to strong leisure volumes and record load factors. Corporate revenues remained healthy, increasing 6% for the quarter. This was driven by domestic up 8% versus prior year. In our most recent corporate travel survey, 83% of travel managers expect to maintain or increase their air travel spend this quarter. This is consistent with last year as pockets of the international softness in the automotive and manufacturing industries are being offset by strength in healthcare, technology and financial service sectors. Cargo revenues declined 17% on both lower volumes and yield as industry capacity continues to outstrip demand. We are actively implementing strategies to mitigate this impact, but are very cautious on the cargo outlook for the remainder of the year. Turning to specifics on unit revenues in the quarter. Total unit revenues were up 3.8%, above our guidance on 4.7% higher capacity. Passenger unit revenues were up 2.9% over prior year, sequentially improving 2 points compared to the March quarter, driven by strong demand. Domestic revenues grew 8.8% with 3.6% higher PRASM. This is the best domestic performance in nearly five years with unit revenue growth in every half. Boston led the system with revenues up 25% over prior year on a 10% improvement in unit revenues. Now with over 140 departures a day, Delta is increasingly the airline of choice for Boston travelers. Internationally, revenues grew by 5.3% as we offset a 1.5-point currency headwind to increase our unit revenues by 1.1%. While Pacific revenue performance was softer than our initial forecast, we were able to maintain our margin performance versus prior year. We see opportunity for profitability to improve as we continue to execute on our multi-year Pacific restructuring. Additional commentary on the entity performance for the June quarter may be found in this morning's press release. Looking forward to the September quarter, total revenue is expected to increase 6% to 7% on a 1.5% to 3.5% improvement in unit revenues. July is off to a great start with a new number one system revenue day -- last Sunday or this Sunday? Jill Greer : This past Sunday. Glen Hauenstein : This past Sunday. Okay. While underlying passenger demand remains strong, sequentially, we expect TRASM to see about 1 point pressure from the Easter holiday timing and a slight deceleration in the transatlantic. Domestic, corporate and leisure demand remains strong. Premium product growth should continue to lead to Main Cabin as we monetize the investments we have made in improving the customer experience. In international, currency headwinds are beginning to moderate in the back half of the year as we lap U.S. dollar strength. Atlantic unit revenue is expected to be roughly flat over prior year as strong U.S. point of origin demand and stable corporate trends are offset by some softer European leisure demand. In the Pacific, we expect unit revenue declines will be similar to the June quarter, but should begin to moderate later this year as we lap foreign exchange headwinds and as our comp ease. Latin is positioned to remain our best performing international entity as strength continues in both Brazil and Mexico, and we expect system capacity to grow by 4% in the September quarter on modest decline from our first half run rate. Full year capacity is trending slightly above 4%, including additional capacity from higher completion factor, incremental joint venture flying to assist our partners with grounded airplanes and increased charter flying. I'd like to congratulate our charter team on an outstanding quarter and strong year-to-date performance. As we think longer term, our opportunities lie in leveraging both our brand and our scale to grow our revenues, expand Delta's competitive advantages and differentiate the perception of Delta in the minds of our consumers. We're targeting our capacity and markets with the best growth potential, improving the efficiency and profitability of our core hubs though upgauging. While the last 10 years were spent fundamentally transforming our domestic hub substructure, we are currently in the midst of the most significant fleet evolution in Delta's history. We are focused on getting the right aircraft on the right routes, allowing us to deliver leading customer service, focused products and services and expanding our margins. With over 200 narrow-bodies set to deliver over the next four years, we are building a more efficient fleet that best serves the scale of our network. These are larger gauge aircraft with a higher percentage of premium seats which help drive Delta's margin profile. Our fleet transformation extends to the international entities as well. Not only will our fleet become more efficient with new deliveries, our entire international fleet will have upgraded interiors including Premium Select and Comfort Plus by the end of 2021. The improved international products combined with efforts to create a more seamless experience for our customers flying within our partner network, gives us confidence in our global ability to continue to drive profitable growth. The scale of our global network, product investments and Delta's best in class service are the foundation for our revenue premium and underlie the improved economics of our recent American Express agreement; that agreement alone should drive a nearly $7 billion contribution by 2023, double to what we saw in 2018. In closing, we expect strong demand to continue throughout the rest of the year. Our first half results and pipeline of initiatives give us strong confidence to again raise our revenue growth target to 6% to 7% for the full year. As pleased as we are with the record June quarter result, we're even more excited about our great runway opportunities. And with that, I'll turn it over to my good friend, Paul. Paul Jacobson : Thanks, Glen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you again for joining us this morning. Our results through the first half of the year show that we're delivering against our Investor Day plan to drive both, topline growth, margin expansion and continue to return consistently to our owners. In the first half of the year, revenue has grown by 8%, our operating margins have expanded by 200 basis points, and we\u2019ve grown earnings per share by 30%. We\u2019ve also generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow, more than all of 2018 with $2 billion of that going back to shareholders. Our after-tax ROIC on a trailing 12-month basis is 15.3% as the investments we have made are driving strong returns. These results give us confidence to raise full year revenue, earnings per share and free cash flow guidance. For the full-year, we're on track to deliver 6% to 7% topline growth, at least a 150 basis points of margin expansion and 25% EPS growth. With results to date and updated expectations for the full year, we now expect to return $3 billion to shareholders in 2019. This is a $500 million increase above our initial plan outlined at Investor Day. Turning to June quarter results. We set a June quarter record with pretax income of $2 billion. Our operating margin of 17.1% was 2.3 points higher than last year; our pretax margin of 16% was the highest we've achieved in two years. We\u2019re firmly on track to exceed our target for full year margin expansion and now expect at least a150 basis points of improvement versus 2018. We continue to deliver solid cost performance with efficiency gains throughout our operations, fleet transformation and One Delta initiatives all contributing. For the June quarter, non-fuel unit costs were up 1.4%, in line with our guidance of 1% to 2%. This included approximately $60 million of pressure due to higher depreciation expense associated with our decision to accelerate the retirement of the MD-90 fleet by two years to the end of 2022. This impact is largely limited to the June quarter as 31 aircraft were permanently retired. We will retire another nine of these aircraft by year end and expect MD-90 depreciation to moderate in future periods. One Delta is enabling a more efficient approach to our ongoing fleet transformation as well. The team has identified a number of opportunities to drive incremental efficiency gains as we transition aircraft into and out of the fleet, minimizing friction cost from operating small sub-fleets. We will continue to realize fleet simplification benefits as we reduce and exit another fleet type in the MD-90. And as we induct new aircraft such as the A330-900neo, we\u2019re streamlining entry into service to minimize unproductive time. This enables crew efficiencies through better training and scheduling management and drives incrementally higher ROIC through less idle time on the asset. Non-fuel unit costs increased 0.6% in the first half of the year, giving us confidence in our full year CASM-Ex guide of approximately 1%. In the back half of 2019, we faced tougher cost comparisons from last year\u2019s performance as well as decelerating capacity growth. While fuel was volatile during the June quarter, Brent prices remained below prior year levels. Total fuel expense decreased $35 million on 4% lower market fuel prices. Refinery profits of roughly $40 million were flat to last year. Our re-fleeting and One Delta initiatives drove a 1.6% improvement in fuel efficiency in the June quarter and we expect a 2% fuel efficiency gain for the full year. Non-operating expenses for the quarter were $60 million higher than prior year due to lower pension income and a decline in our equity partner earnings. For the full year, we now expect non-operating expense to be in the range of $525 million to $575 million. This is above prior expectations due primarily to these lower partner earnings. For the September quarter, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $2.10 to $2.40 per share, up 25% versus prior year\u2019s midpoint. This equates to a pretax margin of 14.5% to 16.5% comparing favorably to last year\u2019s 13.6% result. This includes an expectation for non-fuel unit cost growth of 1% to 2% and all-in fuel price of $1.95 to $2.15 per gallon. This is down from last year and similar to the June quarter. Our guidance includes an approximately $40 million contribution from the refinery this quarter, which is expected to benefit the September quarter fuel price per gallon by roughly $0.04. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains strong. Adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR of 1.7 times is at the low end of our target leverage ratio of 1.5 to 2.5 times. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we continue to proactively address our pension obligation with a voluntary $500 million contribution in the June quarter. We generated $3.3 billion of operating cash flow and reinvested $1.4 billion into the business during the June quarter. This produced free cash flow of $1.8 billion, bringing our first half free cash flow to $2.5 billion. This represented conversion of more than 100% of net income, nicely ahead of last year, benefited by both top-line growth and margin expansion. Our strong first half performance sets us up to achieve $4 billion in free cash flow for the full year and we expect the net income conversion of nearly 90%. This includes our expectation for full year CapEx of $4.5 billion, which is unchanged from initial guidance provided in Investor Day. Our healthy balance sheet and cash generation enable us to consistently return cash back to our owners, while also investing in the future growth of the Company. During the quarter, we returned $497 million to shareholders. Including the accelerated buyback earlier this year, total shareholder returns are just over $2 billion through the first six months of the year. We funded our accelerated buyback in the first quarter with a $1 billion short-term loan. With cash flow running ahead of plan, we completed repayment of the short-term facility earlier than anticipated. Since first announcing our capital allocation strategy in 2013, we have returned more than $14 billion to owners. We've reduced our fully diluted share count by approximately 25% and increased our dividend for six consecutive years. But importantly, we've done that while also investing in our business and our people. Additionally, we're maintaining low debt levels and improving the funded status of our pension plans as part of our commitment to maintain our investment grade credit ratings. Our consistent repurchase activity and 15% dividend increase in the third quarter demonstrate our continued strong conviction on the durability and sustainability of our business model. These results are a validation of our unrivaled network, our dedicated people and our powerful brand. Our competitive advantages continue to deliver industry-leading results and drive long-term value for all of our stakeholders. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jill to begin the Q&A. Jill Greer : Thanks, Paul. Jake, we're ready for questions from the analysts, if you could give the instructions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will begin with Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Mike Linenberg : Yes. Hey. Good morning, everyone. Yes. So, I have one and one follow-up. Just I guess the first one to Glen. You called out the strength in Boston. And I think over this last quarter, I think Boston was maybe officially announced [ph] as a hub. I think there was also some press out about maybe some other focus cities like Nashville and Austin. As we think about your domestic capacity growth in 2019, Glen, will more of it be allocated to these focus cities or newer hubs, or how should we think about the split across your system? Glen Hauenstein : Great question, Mike. I think, Boston is a true focus city for us that we have commitments over the next year, year and half to take our departure levels up towards 200. For those of you who are familiar with our Boston operation, we have shared our terminal with various carriers over the years. And we will take over the entire terminal, starting late this summer, will allow us to continue to grow in Boston. And what we've been focused on is making our hubs more efficient so we can drive higher earnings and targeting those cities that are high growth. And Boston, Seattle, Austin, Nashville, Raleigh, all fit that profile of cities where growth and growth for air travel is significantly higher than they are across the system in general. So, that's really been our thoughts to continue to grow where markets are growing and to continue to make our existing hubs more efficient. Mike Linenberg : Okay, great. And just then jumping over to Paul on the pension, the $500 million contribution. Is there any more -- are you required to contribute more this year? It sounds like maybe you went above and beyond what you were required to. And where is -- what\u2019s the funded status of the pension at this point, if you could? Thanks. Paul Jacobson : Good morning, Mike. Thanks for the question. So, all the contributions that we made are voluntary. As we\u2019ve talked about at Investor Day with airline relief, we have fully completed all of our required funding through 2024. But we remain committed to try to achieve an 80% funded status by the end of 2020. Right now, we're in the low to mid-70s. The plan is performing very well, in line with equity markets globally, and we expect to be a good year on the return front. Operator : We will now move to the next question and that will come from Jamie Baker with JP Morgan. Jamie Baker : Good morning, everybody. First question, either for Glen or for Gil; it\u2019s a hypothetical. If you had a substantive portion of your fleet grounded right now, from an operational perspective, what would be the most intelligent and profitable way for Delta to reintroduce aircraft in a manner that wouldn\u2019t prove detrimental to RASM? Simply hypothetical, how would Delta phase grounded aircraft back into its operation? Hopefully I'm asking in a way you're comfortable answering. Ed Bastian : Hey. Jamie, this is Ed. Actually I\u2019m going to jump to line. I\u2019m going to answer it. We know what you are asking, and it\u2019s really not appropriate for us to be speculating as to what the other carriers ought to do. It's clear that Max has been a real -- it\u2019s had a dramatic impact on our industry. I think the reintroduction when the time comes is going to have to be carefully managed, no question. But in the interim, we're going to continue to watch and see the development there. But, I don\u2019t think we should be looking to second guess or call out the current or the expected actions of our competitors. Jamie Baker : Second probably for Paul. So, you continue -- Delta continues to demonstrate that it's possible to grow revenue at a rate nicely ahead of that of capacity which of course lays ways to the long-held view that that wasn\u2019t possible. Similar to my question last quarter, could you rank order what drives this. I assume loyalty is probably the biggest driver, but we\u2019ve had significant consolidation. There's a phenomenon of segmentation, there is consumer shift from goods to services. I'm just trying to understand the drivers and better hopes of predicting the sustainability of this trend given that it is a new trend. Glen Hauenstein : Jamie, it\u2019s Glen. I think, all those things that you just mentioned are contributors to it. It is not one thing. And it is, while we are really about the American Express transaction, that is not the key driver within the quarter but excellent performance. I think as much being able to charge for products, being able to understand where people want to fly, being able to put the right products and services in those markets and being able to charge customers to what they're willing to pay us for it. And I think it\u2019s a combination of everything you just mentioned. Jamie Baker : Okay... Ed Bastian : Jamie, this is Ed. I\u2019ll just chime in on Glen\u2019s response as well. This is a growing business. I think for years people wondered whether it was a mature business. But, when you think about what consumers are looking to go, and whether it\u2019s as you, the millennial, impact of wanting experience versus ownership, whether it\u2019s the baby boomer segment that\u2019s looking to explore, I think technology has had a huge impact here. People are more aware of the world than ever before, people are more interested in seeing the world and connecting with the world than ever before. And as the best performing airline in a market that\u2019s growing a multiple GDP, we\u2019re really well positioned to see this continue to grow into the future. And all the other actions that you talk of more tactics in terms of how we continue to drive a greater value back to consumers, but I think the fundamental demand for this product in this business is very, very strong. And we\u2019re capitalizing on it. Jamie Baker : And if I could just squeeze in a third question, since you deflected -- understandably deflected the first. Just getting back to Mike\u2019s question about Boston and reiterating a question I asked about 11 years ago, how do you define hub? Ed Bastian : I think a hub is a place that we connect traffic. And an endpoint clearly is the opposite of a hub. And so, to the extent that we\u2019re beginning to connect traffic and more and more traffic over Boston, we would consider it hub. This year, we\u2019re connecting almost a 1,000 people a day from the U.S. to Europe over Boston for example with our partners started new service from Boston to Asia. Now, I think when you think about our ability to connect people through a city that\u2019s what we define as a hub. Jamie Baker : Okay. Thank you very much, gentlemen. Take care. Operator : We\u2019ll now hear from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Rajeev Lalwani : Good morning. Thanks for the time. Glen, I wanted to come back to some of your comments and I guess Ed\u2019s as well. But, in particular when you think about the divergence you\u2019re seeing in cargo and passenger; is that something you\u2019ve seen before as cargo, maybe a leading indicator of potential rollover? I'm just trying to get more and more comfortable with the demand outlook as we\u2019re looking forward. Glen Hauenstein : Well, any of us could take that Rajeev. Cargo is not -- certainly not a big contributor to the total revenues. It\u2019s probably less than 2% of our total revenue base. The impact we\u2019re seeing in airfreight has been across the industry, not just the airline industry but the major freights and express companies are seeing those same impacts. I think a lot of the reduction currently is due to the big inventory build last year in advance of the tariffs and all the geopolitical trade tension that existed. And as a result, there is not as much demand for near in airfreight. So, shipping and other forms of transportation are probably getting a higher amount of volume. So, it\u2019s something that\u2019s important to us but at the same time I don\u2019t think it has really any direct correlation to what we see on our passenger base. Rajeev Lalwani : That\u2019s helpful. And then, Paul, a question for you on the cost side. We\u2019ve obviously seen capacity pick up for this year. Is that not creating a tailwind on the CASM side, or is it simply offset by some of the D&A items you talked about? And then, just generally, how do you feel about keeping trend steady, i.e. inflationary cost curve going forward, given that where we\u2019re looking at, potential labor step-ups for you guys, for the industry and so on? Paul Jacobson : Sure. Thanks, Rajeev. We obviously have enjoyed in the first half some of the benefit and we\u2019ve seen that in our results with our non-fuel CASM benefiting alongside higher completion factor and more consistent and better operational performance contributing to that, that has helped. We've been pressured a little bit by some of the revenue index. So, with revenue growing at more than almost twice the rate of capacity, we see some revenue index pressure around commissions and around merchant fees, et cetera. But, all that is good money to spend from that perspective. Last half of 2018, we had negative CASM. So, we got a little bit tougher comps going in, but we feel very comfortable about holding the line between 1% to 2% and delivering that 1% for the full year. Obviously, the additional D&A from the MD-90 fleet, which we absorbed into our regular earnings has pressured that somewhat. But, we do feel confident. Looking forward, we continue to see really good progress from One Delta. It's contributed almost $200 million incrementally in the first half of this year over 2018 and we're on track to exceed $500 million total from the One Delta program through the first two years on track to our $1 billion number. We're going to need to continue to do that. Obviously, there is potential pressure on the horizon, but we are constantly diligent about it and we feel good about holding that below that 2% goal long term. Rajeev Lalwani : Thank you, guys. Operator : We'll now hear from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : Hey. Good morning. Ed Bastian : Good morning. Hunter Keay : Couple of questions on loyalty. Can you hear me, by the way? Sorry. Ed Bastian : Yes. We can hear you. Hunter Keay : All right. Is there a point where you feel like your loyalty is so strong that you can fully remove yourself from the aggregators that commoditize for look and feel of air travel, airfare? Ed Bastian : Our strategy has been to build something that consumers want to buy and let them choose how they buy it. And that's led to a continuation of a migration towards Delta direct channel and Delta loyal customers. And I think that's how we see the landscape continuing to evolve. The question is, do you want to do a more aggressive and say no to customers who might want to buy our product to a certain way or distributors, and the answer is we would never want to do that. We would just want to continue to focus on buying directly from Delta, and Delta flights as the better way to buy a Delta ticket. Hunter Keay : Why not? I mean, southwest customers, a lot of those guys go straight there without price comparing. And I would argue that a lot of Delta customers now buy Delta airfare without price comparing because they feel like it\u2019s a good value. So, maybe this is a 5 10-year question. But, why not maybe say, if you are going to commoditize our product and sell in the way that's not representative of the value you're getting, we're just not going to do business with you. Ed Bastian : Hunter, let me offer my thoughts here. We're going down that direction obviously. I\u2019d say, 10 years ago, about one-third of our tickets were sold over the online agencies. Today, we're down to somewhere around 10% to 15%. And probably, as you look forward, you're right, delta.com is going to take more and more of that traffic. So, I don't think we need to put a stake in the ground and say that we won't sell over those channels. But at the same time, the online agencies are aware that they need to provide a differentiated experience to our customers in order for us to continue to invest in them and together have our content on their sites. Hunter Keay : Okay. Thanks. And just one more quick one, just related to it. Do you happen to know maybe through survey work or whatever, how many customers book directly with you guys without price comparing? Ed Bastian : We have no idea. Operator : And our next question will come Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi Syth : Just a question on the cost side. With the tariff, I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s having an impact on airport projects and cost, then what the implication for just airport cost in general and the LaGuardia project you're working on in particular, and the types of that. I think we're seeing a lot of just airport projects in general and a lot of funding related to that and wondering if we're going to start to see funding pressure and if that just may translate to higher airport cost for industry in general or if we might see some of these projects getting curtailed? Ed Bastian : Good morning, Savi. Thanks for that. Certainly, we've seen some inflationary and tariff related pressure on structural steel and other elements. I would say actually a little bit of a bigger piece has been just general inflation in the areas of New York and LA where we're constructing. There is obviously a lot of infrastructure work going on and competition for labor is tight. That being said, both of those projects remain on target, on schedule and on budget. The work that the team is doing has been phenomenal on the ground in both places, and this is one of the strong benefits that we feel we have by controlling the financing and controlling the construction of these projects, being able to manage through these things and the teams have done an amazing job. Savi Syth : So, any thoughts, and then as you look at other airports as well, it\u2019s a follow-on on if we're going to kind of continue to see this increasing cost of airport inflation or if some of these projects get curtailed actually as economy kind of slows down here? Ed Bastian : I think, you're going to continue to see airport cost inflation across the board, there is a lot of infrastructure improvement happening, not just at our hubs but across the board. But all of these are customer enhancing and going to make the customer experience better, more streamlined with more features and more modern. So, we actually feel good about it. And those projects are all moving ahead. We feel comfortable absorbing that rate of inflation as we can deliver those products and in line with our general cost goals. Glen Hauenstein : Savi, if I might take a stab at what I think you're getting to is, when you think about the trends in the U.S. aviation industry, the big cities tend to be getting bigger and the small cities tend to be getting a bit smaller. And if you look at Kennedy when we made the initial investment, during the first year or two, our CPE went up slightly. Sitting where we are today, by driving a more efficient, larger airplane through those facilities, which you couldn't have done with the previous facilities, our CPE is now significantly below where we were just a few years ago and even before the construction. So, really, these are the enabling projects for the airlines to become more efficient as well. Operator : And now, we will take a question from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Brandon Oglenski : Good morning, everyone. So Glen or Ed, I want to circle back to this idea of sustainably growing revenue above GDP. And I know, we\u2019ve kind of hit on at this call like the decommoditization of the products. But can you talk to, have you seen, like repeat purchases of these different branded fares or segmented products, or is it just like a novelty that could potentially wear off as consumers just go back thinking, hey, a seat is a seat? Ed Bastian : I think, it's become more and more sticky. And that\u2019s why I think we pointed out that every year, the paid load factors in the premium products get higher and higher and higher, and we continue to drive loyalty into those products and services. So, I think our ability to continue to grow those sectors, I think when you look back and say what was wrong with this industry five or ten years ago as we all thought that it was a race to the bottom and that the only thing that mattered to consumers having all is fare. What we really figured out when we did a lot of survey and results was that for most customers or 60% of the customers, they were choosing on something other than the lowest fare. And then when we dissected that even more that with 60% of customers that really 80% of revenue, and we weren\u2019t really geared towards being able to provide value. And that\u2019s the full genesis of this transformation of Delta and its premium products and services; it\u2019s been about providing people what they want to buy. Glen Hauenstein : And Brandon, the other thing I\u2019d add to that is that we\u2019ve been growing our topline revenues easily the last two years in the high single digits level year-on-year, again multiple of where GDP has been. And the diversity of those revenue streams is powerful, whether it\u2019s loyalty and other components of that but the other thing is our net promoter scores were at their highest in record. So, not only are they purchasing these new products, they\u2019re even more satisfied than ever in the services that Delta is providing. So, I think it\u2019s quite sustainable and I think it\u2019s going to continue to grow at a pretty accelerated pace. Brandon Oglenski : Okay. Well, it makes sense because we\u2019ve always had travel options on hotels and cars. So, if I can, I want to ask one nerdy analyst question here. So, you guys are guiding to 6% to 7% topline growth for the year. Let\u2019s say capacity is around 3%, close to 4% for the fourth quarter. I think that\u2019s implying TRASM that would be close to flat. Is there anything in the guidance that suggests like a slowdown in the industry yields or maybe a bit more caution on the economy? Ed Bastian : As I said -- so, you\u2019re right. That\u2019s a nerdy analyst question. No, we\u2019re not expecting to see any friendships in the numbers, we\u2019re probably just being a little conservative in our long-term topline guide. Brandon Oglenski : All right I appreciate it. Operator : And now, we\u2019ll hear from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Andrew Didora : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Paul, I actually wanted to get your thoughts here as we head into the back half on, just on IMO-2020 and how you\u2019re thinking about that and the impact of jet fuel. Are there any ways to hedge this as what we see futures contract show kind of a meaningful step up from the end of the year into 2020? And does this maybe change your thoughts at all on the refinery? Paul Jacobson : Andrew, good morning. Thanks for that. At the end of the day, as we said, the refinery, given its diesel and jet production will effectively serve as about a 35% hedge against that. So, we feel like we\u2019re well-positioned going into that. Certainly, we\u2019ve seen a little bit of pressure on the future\u2019s curve but it hasn\u2019t been near what the market had expected or at least thought in extreme cases that it would be. So, we\u2019re continuing to watch it and keep it close. The refinery is performing well. We\u2019ve seen some upward pressure on gasoline and other products on the profitability of that given the recent announcement by PES to shut down their refinery. And we feel like we\u2019re well-positioned to be able to continue to deliver those results. Andrew Didora : Got it. That\u2019s helpful on the diesel and jet hedge. And I guess my follow-up question here just on the free cash flow execution, obviously has been excellent this year. Can you maybe talk a little bit on how sustainable you see this $4 billion going forward, particularly in the face of maybe some rising jet fuel, possibly slowing economy? And can you remind us of what levers you have to pull in case any of these scenarios play out? Thanks. Ed Bastian : Well, sure. We always have the flexibility levers on voluntary spending and capital et cetera to be able to manage that, which is why our balanced capital allocation strategy is the right one, because it can be flexible and respond to changes. But, if you look at our cash flow conversion rates, they've been going up pretty steadily. And a huge contributor to that is the American Express deal. We\u2019ve talked about the loyalty program, the cash turn versus the deferral that we see. Some of that to the balance sheet is very strong and that's expected to continue to grow, which will enhance our operating cash generation going forward. This year in particular, we've lapped a couple of sizable increases in non-cash related expenses, principally the pension as well as depreciation and amortization. So, you see the cash efficiency of the earnings stream increasing and that should continue as well. So, the trajectory we're on we\u2019re confident about, and we feel good about being able to continue that performance into the future. Andrew Didora : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from David Vernon. One moment, please. David Vernon : Hey. Hello? Operator : Go ahead. David Vernon : Coming back to the theme of infrastructure for a second, Paul. If you think about the amount of money sort of Delta has been putting into airport projects for last several years, is there a point over the next several years where you start to get some free cash flow leverage off of that investment, because we're starting from a pretty low base in terms of airport quality around the network? I'm just wondering if there is a point in investment horizon where that non-aircraft CapEx could start to fall off a little bit. Paul Jacobson : Well, thanks for that, David. We also, for the large projects that we are doing because we finance those in the tax-exempt markets or through general airport funds, are excluding those from investing activities, because they are on a standalone and we repay those over time. So, I think there is going to be a steady stream of investment across the airports whether it's driven by the airports themselves or by us. We\u2019ve put significant investment into our Sky Club and Lounge program for customer satisfaction. And clearly, those are paying dividends in the product scores and the revenue performance of the Company as well. So, I don't see the non-large infrastructure changing significantly, as we go forward. But, those large infrastructure projects will be here for a little bit of time, and they will be great for the customers. And as Glen talked about, they create some significant operational efficiencies and scale benefits for us to be able to amortize those costs over higher loads. David Vernon : And maybe just as a follow-up, Glen, that tie in as for kind of the cost advantages, creates for you as a bigger airline. As we kind of finish the development of the airport at LaGuardia, for example, how does that change sort of the competitive dynamic against the lower cost carrier in that market? Glen Hauenstein : I don't think we want to speculate on how they're going to react to the new facilities. But, I do think that we know that in order to accommodate the growth of air travel in New York City, we have to have a bigger facility as if you\u2019ve used it, you understand how constrained it is. And that constrains our ability to put larger airplanes in there that can drive significant cost efficiencies and accommodate growth over time. I think we all realize particularly in summertime how constrained New York City aerospace is. So, there is really no way to be able to put more airplanes in there. So, we're going to have to put bigger airplanes in there that are more efficient, and those facilities are the key enablers of that. David Vernon : Given your scale benefit, wouldn\u2019t you think that the higher cost per employment might be more relatively impactful for a lower cost carrier than it would be for you to absorb, or am I not thinking about that right? Glen Hauenstein : Clearly, our business model would be favored in a high CPE environment. Operator : Now, we will take a question from Helane Becker with Cowen. Helane Becker : One of the areas that you guys seem to be on the leading edge of but don\u2019t talk a lot about is what you are doing regarding environmental and sustainability efforts. And I think you're pretty big internationally and that seems to be where there is more focus rather than the U.S. -- from international investors more than domestic investors. But could maybe talk a little bit about how we should think about your efforts in that regard and whether you think they add to brand and so on? Thank you. Ed Bastian : Sure. Helane, thanks. It\u2019s a very good question and you are absolutely right. ESG is going to become an increasingly important part of our responsibilities in our governance of our brand and how we operate in to the future. You are right that is probably a bigger point of emphasis in Europe today than it is in the U.S., but it's going to continue to grow here as well. We\u2019ve made a lot of commitments as an industry as well as in airline and I'm pleased to say that the Delta is continuing to meet its commitments in that. We\u2019ve made a commitment as a company as well as an industry to reduce our footprint by 50% by the year 2050, which requires that we need to continue to reduce our footprint by up to 2% per year and which is right in line with where we are today on fuel and emissions. We\u2019ve made a commitment as a company to eliminate single use plastics from on-board our aircraft, as well as in our lounges, in our airports and we continue to make new announcements. I just saw the new amenity kits that we\u2019ve got for international that's eliminated the plastic. We're going to be taking the wrappers off the blankets here soon. Every day there is a lot of small efforts, all of which add up to a lot of big impacts. So, ESG is something that we are paying good attention to. I think, investors will increasingly pay more attention too. And it\u2019s going to be a point of pride for Delta people as we bring forth the lead in that effort as well. Gil West : I would just add, this is Gil, that also sustainability goes hand in hand with efficiency because as the waste is reduced, right, there is a cost savings associated with that. So, whether it\u2019s fuel, as an example, fuel efficiency to be, but everything else associated with waste, we save money on. Operator : Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thanks and congrats on the strong results. I wanted to ask you about the accelerated retirement of the MD-90s two years early. Was there a corresponding new order to facilitate that? How far out does your current narrow-body order book take you? And have you considered any potentially opportunistic pricing on the Max? Paul Jacobson : Hey, Duane. This is Paul. Thanks for the question. The decision to retire the MD-90s is part of the continued move and fleet simplification. Driving that through, we feel comfortable with our existing order book. There were new orders accompanying that decision as we thought about it. And we feel good with that balance on the trajectory that we\u2019re on to be able to drive to the benefits of fleet simplification, significantly reduce the complexity in the business, which is going to translate to better efficiency going forward. Duane Pfennigwerth : And have you been tempted by any opportunistic pricing on the Max? Glen Hauenstein : Duane, we are very focused on the narrow-body transformation that Glen talked about in his comments. We\u2019ve got -- we made a decision two years ago to invest in the 321. And I think that we\u2019re going to stay that course. Duane Pfennigwerth : Fair enough. Thank you. And then, just for my follow-up, very strong Latin RASM, comps actually get easier, much easier in the back half. Can you just remind us what were the main drivers of weakness in the second half of last year, was it more Mexico, was it South America? Thanks for taking the questions. Glen Hauenstein : It was both, Mexico and Brazil last year, which have had turnarounds in both those marketplaces that really -- those are at the centers of Latin turnaround. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thank you. Jill Greer : Jake, we\u2019re going to have time for one more question from the analysts. Operator : Thank you. And that question will come from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Dan McKenzie : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Both of my questions also tie to revenue sustainability. On corporate revenue, I\u2019m hope you can elaborate on underlying volumes tied to the larger managed accounts and the smaller unmanaged accounts. I'm wondering if there\u2019s been a change in velocity here. One of your competitors had some pretty substantial operational disruptions. And I guess, I'm wondering, to what extent there are new revenue pipelines getting turned on from potentially new accounts or is just the corporate revenue story more about getting the existing account, just to pay more? Glen Hauenstein : So, it really isn\u2019t about the corporate accounts paying more. It\u2019s really the yield trends have been very stable this year both domestically and actually slightly down internationally primarily driven by currency headwinds. But it\u2019s really been a volume story. Volumes have been up throughout the year. So, we\u2019ve seen very robust volumes, particularly domestically with many weeks being up double-digits in terms of the volumes. So, I think we\u2019re relatively excited about the broadness of this. And clearly there are industries that are growing and there are industries that are scaling back. But in general, the trends have been overwhelmingly positive for volume. Dan McKenzie : Glen, I thing that actually ties to the second question I have here. And that is just sort of kind of helping to clarify some of the revenue outlook for later this year. It sounds like the outlook is factoring in some impact from the Max is coming back and potentially from some elevated macro risk. And it sounds like you\u2019ve got some strong offsets to those headwinds, corporate volumes being one of those. Should we think about the offsets to some of these risks later this year as also being on the international side of the revenue equation ex-Europe? Glen Hauenstein : I think, as we go through the year and really more in the fourth quarter, we\u2019re starting to lap the higher dollar. And as you know, international has a longer sale -- advance sale than domestic. So, the tail end of the fourth quarter should -- or the mitigation of headwinds should be better as we move through the year. And we're also looking at starting to lap some of the weakness in some of the sectors. As we have mentioned earlier in the call, automotive has been down. And as you might expect with a hub in Detroit and a very big Midwest presence, that had a pretty large impact on us. So, as we get to the fourth quarter, we're actually lapping those lower comps. And so, that should actually improve. Hopefully, we can get back to a constructive environment in one of our biggest sectors. And so, we are really looking forward to a very strong close to the year. Dan McKenzie : Very good. That's helpful. Good job on the quarter. Thanks very much. Jill Greer : I think that's going to wrap up the analyst portion of the call. We will hand it over to mates in our media team. Jake, if you could give the instructions to the media for how to get in the queue. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go first to Leslie Josephs with CNBC. Leslie Josephs : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Could you please update us on what\u2019s going on with Wi-Fi and those tests? You said you had a two-week test in the last quarter. Where are the tests this quarter and when you expect it to be free throughout the network? Thanks. Ed Bastian : Sure. Leslie, this is Ed. We did conduct two weeks of test. It was on a limited scale. We learned a lot about the technical capacity challenges that you face when you want to open a Wi-Fi up free on with great broadband capabilities across our entire global network. We are now ready to announce when the next free test will come, but they will be coming certainly later this year, and we're on a path here. We think it's important that our customers stay connected. And entertainment is something I think that will continue to distinguish Delta in the sky. Leslie Josephs : Thanks. And then, just one quick follow-up on the interview this morning, you said that about 65% to 70% of first class is paid in cash. That's first class purely or is that first in like Delta One business class as well? Ed Bastian : That\u2019s essentially our first-class product, both domestic as well as international, our paid load factors in that 60% to 70% range. Leslie Josephs : What was it last year\u2026 Ed Bastian : What's that? Leslie Josephs : Sorry. What was it last year? Paul Jacobson : Well, I can give you some of the details. Leslie Josephs : Okay. Thanks. Ed Bastian : Importantly, it's not cash. It's cash and frequent flyers using their mileage to upgrade into those cabins. And I think that's one of the real -- when we talk about continuing to increase the diversity and the ability for people to sit up here, we're trying to bring more and more ways to get there. And that's -- increasing the distribution has been one of the keys. Leslie Josephs : Thanks. Operator : And now, we will hear from Tracy Rucinski with Reuters. Tracy Rucinski : Hi. Good morning. I'm interested in hearing a little more context on your Hanjin Korean Air investment. You mentioned your close personal relationship with the Cho family. Did anyone from the Cho family contacts out to ask for help in wording the activist fund, KCGI, and what role do you expect to have in Korean Air corporate governance? Ed Bastian : Tracy, this is Ed. We do have a close relationship with the family as well as with the company. We are in contact on almost daily basis across our two companies. And I\u2019m not going to comment relative to investment, how we develop our investment thesis. But the investment that we made in Korean is consistent with the investments you\u2019ve seen us make in many of our main partners around the globe. So, I don't think there should be anything considered unusual at all about it. Operator : We will now take a question from Ted Reed with Forbes. Ted Reed : Thank you. I have two questions. So, first is about the Max. When you guys decided not to buy the Max, what was the reason? Your competitors had it -- had ordered it, was it just cost or was the wait too long or something else? Ed Bastian : Listen, the Max, is a good product. I\u2019m not dismissing, it\u2019s a very competitive tool that OAL has. We look at all aspects of performance. We looked at the customer view of product. We looked at the cost from the OEM. We looked at the engine. We looked at what we were able to do with Pratt and Whitney on the geared turbofan and the commitments that we\u2019ve received in the neo. So, it was a comprehensive review. It was a close call. We spent quite a few months analyzing and going back and forth. But the 321neo in aggregate carried the day for us. Ted Reed : All right. Thank you. Secondly, I would like to ask about Boston. You said -- Glen, you said you get the 200. Is that going to be it for you, once you get to 200? And also you mentioned competitors are flying Boston to Asia, is that something you are interested in? Glen Hauenstein : No. I said, our partners were flying from Boston to Asia. As you may know, our partner Korean launched Korea to Boston this year on 787 and it was an incredible success. So, they\u2019ve been doing quite well on that way. I think they will expand that service as we move into next year. We\u2019ve been working with our partners, we\u2019ve been growing our own hub. And I think 200 is kind of our medium-term objective here and we think we\u2019ll get there in the next 18 to 24 months. But beyond that, we\u2019ll see how the market grows. We think at 200, it\u2019s a very sustainable and very profitable franchise for us. Ted Reed : Is it important to be the number one carrier in market share in Boston? Glen Hauenstein : No. It\u2019s important to be the most profitable and most loved. Ted Reed : All right. Thank you, Glen. Ed Bastian : Jake, we have time for one final question, please. Operator : And that final question will come from Elliott Blackburn with Argus Media. Elliott Blackburn : Good morning. Thanks. I wanted to ask, you guys touched on this a bit and you bought the Trainer refinery years back in part to ensure continued fuel production in the New York market. How does the planned closure of the Philadelphia refinery change Delta's outlook for fuel supply and cost in that region? Paul Jacobson : Elliott, this is Paul Jacobson. Thanks for question. That Trainer refinery was originally purchased for events just like this. As we saw supply contracting in the region through various closures back in 2012, we saw this as an opportunity for us to take a little bit more control over production and we've done just that. We've taken the refinery and used it in connection with our commercial operations to drive on average $0.05 per gallon benefit against our competitors using the benefits of the refinery and all the logistics expertise that we have. That means this translates to about $200 million per year. Certainly, we expect to see some rebalancing going on with the lost production from the PES facility. And we believe the Trainer refinery is well positioned to help us offset any increases in the region we might see. Elliott Blackburn : Thanks. Do you guys continue to seek a partner at that facility or how is this also changing kind of your outlook for refining generally in that area? Paul Jacobson : We\u2019re always looking for opportunities to enhance the return structure and the overall structure of how we manage that refinery. We went through the process, we found -- we\u2019ve got multiple investors and firms interested in talking to us. Ultimately, we weren\u2019t able to put a deal together that met all of our needs and have decided for the time being to remain at the status quo. So, we expect no changes in that structure and we\u2019ve put our pencils down on that process. Elliott Blackburn : Thanks very much. Ed Bastian : That will conclude today\u2019s call. We\u2019re grateful for everyone\u2019s time and look forward to sharing the great results that we will be talking about in October. Thank you, everybody. Operator : Once again, ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude your conference for today. We do thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Delta Air Lines September Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. My name is Jake, and I will be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today\u2019s call will be recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jill Greer : Thanks, Jake. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our September quarter call. Joining us from Atlanta today are Delta\u2019s CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Paul Jacobson. Our entire leadership team is here in the room for the Q&A session. Ed will open the call and give an overview of Delta\u2019s financial performance, Glen will then address the revenue environment, and Paul will conclude with the review of our cost performance and cash flow. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up. Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta\u2019s SEC filings. We\u2019ll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. And you can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investors Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, Ed. Ed Bastian : Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Demand for the Delta product is as strong as ever, and our powerful brand unmatched competitive strengths and pipeline of initiatives are driving earnings growth, margin expansion, and solid returns for our owners. Earlier today, Delta reported the September quarter pretax profit of $2 billion, which is up $350 million from last year. Our EPS increased 30% to $2.32 per share with operating margins expanding by 2.5 points. Importantly, we\u2019ve already generated $4 billion in free cash flow year-to-date. Our employees continued to deliver the very best operational reliability and service for our customers, even against the summer\u2019s backdrop of record passenger volumes, airport construction projects, and difficult weather. We\u2019ve now had 123 days without a single cancellation across the entire Delta system this year, a 23% improvement over last year\u2019s record performance. This unprecedented level of reliability combined with great service from our team continued to drive higher customer satisfaction and growing brand affinity for Delta. Year-to-date, our domestic net promoter score has improved more than 5 points over the prior year, and we\u2019re also seeing positive momentum in international net promoter scores with opportunity for further improvement as we continue to upgrade cabin interiors and enhance our customer experience. Stronger customer satisfaction is translating into higher revenues. Revenues grew 6.5% to a record $12.6 billion in the quarter, and we now expect to achieve approximately 7% top-line growth for the full year. I want to thank the entire Delta team for producing one of the best quarters in our history. You are the force behind the Delta brand. And to recognize your efforts through a challenging summer, we have accrued another $517 million towards next February\u2019s profit sharing. This brings the total for the year to nearly $1.3 billion. In addition, we\u2019re making important investments in our people, including improvements to benefits in the 4% base pay increase that went into effect last week for ground employees and flight attendants.  Beyond investments in our people, we are continuing to improve the customer experience through a record number of new aircraft deliveries, airport terminal projects, and technology innovations. These investments support long-term growth, industry-leading profitability, and strong cash flow. In many ways, 2019 has been a transformational year for our Company. We\u2019ve firmly established Delta as the largest airline in the world, both on revenues and profits and are solidly on track to produce our fifth straight year with pretax profits in excess of $5 billion. We have the world\u2019s most valuable airline brands, one that is mentioned not just among the best global airlines but alongside top consumer brands. And we\u2019re building out our portfolio of industry-leading partners across our business. Just two weeks ago, we announced a new strategic partnership with LATAM Airlines. The agreement adds geographic diversity in a fast growing continent, adding 100 new destinations to our map and significantly improving our position in South America. Once approved, our proposed JV will move Delta from current number four position in South America to a combined number one position. We expect this partnership to translate to $1 billion in new annual revenue over the next five years and improve returns in the Latin entity. Along with our existing partnerships with Aeromexico and WestJet, we\u2019re creating a true carrier of the Americas with the ability to connect travelers as never before. American Express is another important long-term partner, and the combination of our two brands has created an industry-leading co-brand credit card portfolio. Our recent contract renewal provides a diverse, high-margin revenue stream that we expect to grow to nearly $7 billion by 2023, with further growth through the end of the decade. Last week, we announced the major relaunch of our Delta SkyMiles American Express Card portfolio. We are providing our customers with more ways to earn miles and new benefits that deliver an even better travel experience. The investments we\u2019re making in our people, product, service, and partnerships are diversifying our revenues and will grow the earnings power of our business for years to come, important steps on our path to being the world\u2019s leading airline. Demand for our product has never been higher. We\u2019ve grown our revenues by 15% over the last two years. And to ensure that we continue to deliver the very best product and returns in this industry, we need to continue to invest in our people and our service. This volume growth coupled with challenging weather patterns has added costs in the back half of the year and will add about 1 point to our CASM-Ex fuel run rate in 2020. I'm confident that these are the right investments for the health of our brand. And with the productivity still to come from our fleet, facility and technology investments, we have the right platform to mitigate this cost inflation over the long term. With that said, it is important to note, our overall fourth quarter unit costs all-in are expected to be down 1% due to the drop in fuel prices and our margins should expand once again in Q4. In closing, we are on track to deliver very strong results in 2019. Demand trends remain healthy and our full-year earnings guidance is for more than 20% improvement over last year's earnings per share. We have built a durable foundation through our culture, leading operational reliability, unrivaled network, our loyalty program, and relationship with American Express and an investment grade balance sheet. These strengths combined with a great brand powered by the very best professionals in the business provide the engine to drive long-term value for our owners. I look forward to sharing more details on our strategic outlook and 2020 business plan at our upcoming Investor Day in December. Now, with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Glen and Paul to go through the details of the quarter. Glen Hauenstein : Thanks, Ed, and good morning. First, I\u2019d like to thank the entire Delta team for their hard work during our busiest summer ever. In the quarter, we ran record load factors and carried 3.3 million more passengers than last year, up 6%. The exceptional operational performance and unmatched service our people provide are the foundation for improving customer satisfaction and the reason why more customers than ever are choosing to fly Delta. When combined with the solid demand backdrop and progress against our commercial initiatives, we delivered a record quarterly revenue of $12.6 billion, up 6.5% over last year. This marks the ninth consecutive quarter of top line growth at a level more than 2 times GDP. We also continue to diversify our business with 52% of our revenue generated by premium products, loyalty, and other non-ticket revenue sources. Premium product revenue grew 9% in the quarter to $4 billion on top of last year's growth of 13%. Momentum is expected to continue from the modernization of our fleet and improved ability to sell these products. Total loyalty revenues grew 16% to $1.2 billion, driven by double-digit increases in mileage redemptions, co-brand spend, new card acquisitions, and roughly 100 million benefit from the new contract with American Express. Enhancing our customer loyalty and trust is at the heart of our business. And together with American Express, we are finding new and innovative ways to reward our customers for their loyalty. We are on track to achieve another record year of card acquisitions in 2019. Our redesigned card offerings will deliver rich rewards and support continued growth in our membership base in the years ahead. We are making SkyMiles more valuable by offering members more ways to use Miles on Delta. Miles as currency launched last December and customer response has been strong. By the end of the year, we expect nearly 1 million customers will have used Miles to upgrade their experience. This revenue stream is projected to deliver over $100 million this year, ahead of our initial expectations. We expect this to continue to grow as we give our SkyMiles members more options to use miles anywhere they can use cash with Delta. Corporate revenue was solid, improving 5% in the September quarter on top of the 12% improvement in the same period of last year. Domestic led with 8% revenue growth, offsetting a modest decline in international corporate revenue. In our most recent corporate travel survey, 86% of travel managers expect to maintain or increase their travel spend in 2020. Leisure revenues remained healthy, growing 7% for the quarter with very strong demand during the peak summer travel season. Our MRO grew 9% in the quarter, and we are confident in our goal of roughly 20% improvement for the full year. Similar to the freight operators, we are seeing pressure on cargo revenues, which declined 17% on both lower volumes and yields. This is consistent with last quarter\u2019s decline. Turning to some specifics on unit revenues in the quarter. Total unit revenues were up 2.5% at the midpoint of our guidance on 3.9% higher capacity. Passenger unit revenues were up 1.7% over prior year as strengthen in domestic and Latin more than offset headwinds from FX and pockets of non-U.S. point of sale softness along with the impact of lower fuel costs. We continued to optimize our leading domestic network with revenues growing 7.8% on 3.2% higher RASM and a sustained unit revenue premium to the industry of nearly 120%. Revenue and margins grew in every domestic hub with revenue improvements of 10% in our coastal hubs and 6% in our core hubs. Boston performance led the system again with 24% increase in revenue and a 5-point improvement in margin. Internationally, revenues grew by 1.1% as 3.1% capacity growth offset a 1.9% decline in PRASM including more than 1 point of currency headwind. Latin was our best performing entity with 3.6% PRASM improvement. In the Atlantic, we saw strong U.S. point of sale continuing to offset weakness in European point of sale as currency was a major factor during the quarter, driving nearly all of the 1.6% PRASM decline. Pacific is the only entity where revenue was down over prior year. This was due to a decline in corporate travel driven by tariff impacts on the automotive and manufacturing sectors, and lower leisure demand to and from China. While Pacific is facing some near-term headwinds, we continue to see long-term opportunity for growth and profitability improvement. Looking forward, December quarter total revenue is expected to increase more than 5% on unit revenues of flat to up 2%. We are seeing solid corporate and leisure demand with revenue growth driven by premium products, loyalty and MRO. Sequentially, December quarter TRASM is negatively impacted by the timing of JV settlements and Jewish holiday calendar shift. Excluding these items, underlying PRASM growth remains consistent at approximately 1.5% in both 3Q and 4Q. For the full year, we now expect to achieve approximately 7% revenue growth on full year capacity growth of 4.5%, while sustaining our 110% unit revenue premium to the industry. While still in the planning stages for 2020, the strong demand environment and our commercial initiatives and our relaunch to service to India support our expectations for another year of revenue growth in excess of GDP. As always, we remain mindful of the economic backdrop, changes in fuel price and the industry landscape. Our additional planning assumptions for 2020 call for 3 to 4 points of capacity, with a point of that capacity related to our relaunch of service to India. Generally, capacity growth will be focused in the areas of strength that support our long-term plans. This includes further optimization of our domestic network and growing our global presence in conjunction with our partners. Our premium products and non-ticket sources like American Express and our MRO business are expected to continue to outpace our main cabin revenue growth into next year as we build on our strong 2019 results. We will provide more details of our capacity growth and commercial initiative for 2020 and beyond in our upcoming Investor Day in December. In closing, a more diversified revenue base along with our pipeline of Delta specific initiatives, give us confidence in our ability to achieve the high end of our plan for 6% to 7% revenue growth in 2019 and sets us up nicely for another year of revenue growth in excess of GDP in 2020. And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to my good friend Paul. Paul Jacobson : Thanks, Glen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. We\u2019re delivering against our Investor Day plan to drive top line growth, margin expansion and consistent returns to our owners. Year-to-date, our top-line has grown 8%, operating margins have expanded by over 200 basis points, and we\u2019ve grown earnings per share by 30%, driven by strong core fundamentals in our extended Amex agreement. We\u2019ve also generated $4 billion of free cash flow, meeting our full year target in the first three quarters of the year, while also reinvesting in the business. Our investments continue to drive strong returns, supporting the long-term growth potential of the business. Our after-tax return on invested capital on a trailing 12-month basis is 15.9%. This represents more than 300 basis points of improvement since 2017, while our invested capital base has increased by nearly $2 billion. Turning to September quarter results. We delivered solid performance in the quarter with pretax income of $2 billion and a pretax margin of 15.7%, 2 points higher than last year. Fuel was volatile during the quarter, but average prices remained below prior year levels. Total fuel expense decreased $249 million on 18% lower market fuel prices, including a $49 million benefit from the refinery during the quarter. Our refleeting initiatives drove a 2.1% improvement in fuel efficiency during the quarter, keeping us on track to deliver a 2% fuel efficiency gain for the full year. While non-fuel unit costs in the quarter were up 2.4%, total unit costs were down 2%, as a result of those fuel prices. During the September quarter, we announced a pay increase for eligible ground and flight attendant employees effective October 1st. This had a modest impact on the September quarter, and has about a 1 point impact on CASM-Ex in the December quarter. In addition to the pay increase, we\u2019re making investments in staffing and resources to ensure that our people can continue to deliver an industry-leading product for our customers in light of the strong demand. We expect these investments which provide the foundation for sustainable growth will add about 1 point to non-fuel cost in 2020. Our current plan assumption for 2020 is non-fuel unit cost growth of 2% to 3%. We\u2019ll provide more detail on that at our December Investor Day. In the December quarter, we\u2019re also seeing an approximate 1.5-point impact to unit cost from the mark-up of liabilities related to long-term disability and retirement benefits. We do not expect there to be any impact from these adjustments on 2020 costs. Our investments combined with these accruals are adding approximately 3 points of CASM-Ex pressure in the December quarter and resulting in expected non-fuel unit cost growth of 4% to 5%. Non-operating expenses for the quarter were $65 million higher than prior year, primarily due to higher pension expense consistent with our 2019 guidance. For the full-year, we continue to expect non-operating expense in the range of $525 million to $575 million. Looking forward, we expect December quarter earnings to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.50 per share. This equates to a pretax margin of 9.5% to 11.5%, which is down from prior year as we lap more than $100 million of onetime gains, including the sale of Delta Global Services last year. Excluding this non-operating gain, our pretax margin is expected to improve over prior year and we expect our operating margin will expand by more than 150 basis points. For the December quarter, we are forecasting fuel to remain below prior year levels, with all-in fuel price of $2 to $2.20 per gallon. We expect total unit costs to decline again in the December quarter as a result of this. With the solid fourth quarter outlook, we are on track to grow full-year earnings per share by more than 20%. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the September quarter, adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 1.7 times at the low end of our target leverage ratio of 1.5 to 2.5 times. During the September quarter, we generated nearly $2.4 billion of operating cash flow, reinvested $800 million into the business, and invested $150 million to support our new strategic partnership with LATAM. This produced free cash flow of $1.4 billion, meeting our full-year free cash flow target of $4 billion in just nine months. Our full-year core CapEx guidance $4.5 billion is unchanged, including the $100 million as part of our LATAM agreement to acquire 14 A350 aircraft. This recent transaction with LATAM is an exciting opportunity for Delta and as an example of how our balance sheet enables strategic moves that expand our competitive strengths. We continue to consistently return cash to our owners in addition to investing in the future growth of the Company. During the September quarter, we returned $468 million to shareholders. For the year, we remain on track to return approximately $3 billion, in line with our commitment to return at least 70% of free cash flow to shareholders. Our consistent repurchase activity and 15% dividend increase in the third quarter demonstrates our continued conviction on the durability and sustainability of our business model. We've been able to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders while maintaining low debt levels and improving the funded status of our pension as part of our commitment to maintain our investment grade ratings. These financials are a validation of our strengths, which continue to deliver industry-leading results and drive long-term value for all of our stakeholders. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jill to begin the Q&A. Jill Greer : Thanks. And before we go to the Q&A, if we can just -- that time of year when we announce our December Investor Day this year, please mark your calendars for December 11th and 12th. We'll be back here in our hometown of Atlanta. For now, just mark your calendars, we'll send out more information as the date gets closer. So, with that, Jake, if we can have the instructions for the analysts on how to join the queue? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll hear first from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Michael Linenberg : Hey. Thanks, yes. Hey. Good morning, everybody. I guess, maybe this is a question to Ed. If you can just give us an update on kind of where things, to the best of your knowledge, stand with respect to the tariff situation and the potential impact to Delta? And is it new aircraft orders; is it order aircraft as they deliver? Any color around this topic would be great. Thanks. Ed Bastian : Thanks, Mike. It\u2019s aircraft as they are being delivered, which we have expressed our concerns that this is kind of a retrospective tariff on decisions taken in the past. That said, we\u2019re evaluating all of our options. We do not expect the cost to incur -- any cost of tariffs through the end of this year. We are expecting some deliveries out of Mobile in terms of 321s and those do not carry a tariff. And looking forward, we\u2019re examining our options next year to make sure that we mitigate any increase to the prices that we\u2019ve already negotiated with Airbus. So, at this point, yes, we\u2019re looking at our options, and I am not going to into any details around the options since it\u2019s still pretty fluid at the moment, but we do not expect this is going to be a material cost to Delta, certainly not in the near term. Michael Linenberg : Okay, great. And then, just a quick follow-up to Paul. I just -- I'm not sure if I heard it right. You talked about the CapEx associated with the LATAM A350s, and maybe that was just an amount that hits in 2019. Did you say $100 million or did I hear that right? Paul Jacobson : Mike, you heard that correct. That\u2019s expected in the fourth quarter of \u201819. Michael Linenberg : Okay. Thanks, everyone. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Moving on to Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey, thanks. So, just playing back the summer, it feels like you\u2019ve tried to flex up and respond to the environment, and that has obviously driven some expense, some over time, some airport costs. Can you comment on the quality of the incremental traffic that you picked up? Was it high quality or was it low yielding? And is this something that you plan to repeat in 2020? If not, why isn\u2019t it a tailwind to the 2020 cost outlook? Ed Bastian : Hey, Duane. This is Ed. I\u2019ve said a number of times, second quarter as well as the third quarter, we certainly were a beneficiary of the MAX not operating. That said, we don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve got -- we\u2019ve got a significant amount of new incremental growth coming from that. The majority of the growth clearly was the strength of our own brand, strength of our product and services, which continues to outperform anything that we\u2019ve seen historically, and the costs that we talk about are not just due to the high demand. Remember, we ran a load factor of 90% from April all the way through August pretty much. But we also had an incredibly volatile weather pattern this summer that gave us very limited recovery option. So, the heightened load factor expectations, the fact that MAX was not out, the weather, all created an environment that we\u2019ve got to reinvest to make certain that next year, because I expect the share -- any share we picked up are going to retain going forward, we\u2019re better prepared to handle the volumes in 2020. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay, thanks. And then just for my follow-up, I wanted to ask you maybe a longer-term question about South Florida. How do you think about the growth prospects for that market longer term and potential connecting opportunities with the LATAM partnership? Is this about getting a bigger presence in South Florida for Delta or is it about building out from Atlanta to point South? Thanks for taking the questions. Glen Hauenstein : Thanks for the questions, Duane. It\u2019s a little bit of both. I think, if you think about improving the connectivity to the existing LATAM infrastructure in South Florida, there is a little bit we probably have to add to replace some of the flows that\u2019s existing today on American, but we\u2019re not creating a new hub; we're not creating a new giant connecting complex. We're doing selective adds. So, think of it, if you think about Miami as a hub and you think about our size in Dallas or Denver or Chicago, it probably looks a lot more like that to make sure we have key fleets that will go over Miami and then really work with LATAM once we get ATI to continue to develop Atlanta and our other U.S. gateways as the primary connecting points for the South America traffic. So, I think we have a pretty good plan that takes the best of both, that\u2019s connecting complexes in the U.S. and best service within the local markets, and I think that\u2019s going to be a great platform for growth moving forward. Operator : We will now move to the next question, and that will come from Helane Becker with Cowen. Helane Becker : So, I think this might be a question for Paul. As I look at those actuarial assumptions you changed, you mentioned that it doesn\u2019t flow through to next year. But, I think you are also spending some money to bring your pension plans into closed or funded status. So, I was just wondering if it's possible for you to give us an update on that. Paul Jacobson : Good morning, Helane. Those two issues are somewhat unrelated. The actuarial changes relate to the long-term disability program, and this is actuarial tables that are updated every few years and we\u2019d seen a little bit of an increase in trends. So, we have to markup that liability one time. It hits that P&L, and that\u2019s why it's not expected to repeat this year -- or next year. As to the pension, we continue to strive to target 80% funded status by the end of 2020. And so far, the assets are on strong trajectory this year with strong returns. Our pension expense, as we cited on in the prepared remarks is really a function of last year's returns as that gets spread over a full year. So, as we head into 2020 and we get those updates both on the funding as well as the investment returns, we\u2019ll have more detail at Investor Day on 2020. Operator : We will now move to the next caller. And that will come from Joe Caiado with Credit Suisse. Joe Caiado : Paul, maybe just picking off where Helane left off there on 2020. I\u2019m not asking for explicit cash flow guidance for 2020, obviously, but just hoping you could walk us through some of the puts and takes in operating cash flow for next year, things like cash taxes, you just touched on the pension there, but any other moving pieces that we should be aware of? Paul Jacobson : Good morning, Joe. Not materially. Obviously, we see growth in the business, we see growth in the Amex portfolio as we continue to work our way up to nearly $7 billion by 2023. Those are some good sides in the business. We have articulated a belief that we\u2019ll be a cash taxpayer in 2020. That\u2019s not expected to be a huge headwind for us. So, we see consistent cash flow generation in 2020 at this point. And we\u2019ll provide those details at Investor Day as well. Joe Caiado : Okay. I appreciate it. And my second question on free Wi-Fi, whoever wants to take this. It\u2019s obviously something that your business travelers demand. So, that\u2019s an important box for you to check. But, it also feels like it\u2019s a consumer data play. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about maybe the second derivative commercial opportunity from that initiative, if you will, just perhaps in terms of what it can do for merchandising or just learning more about every passenger and every seat. In other words, how do you monetize free Wi-Fi over time? Ed Bastian : Hey, Joe. This is Ed. I\u2019ve again been vocal on this. I think, it\u2019s something that our customers not just demand but deserve. I think, the main benefit to me is the connection that they will continue to have to the brand and the strength of the brand and our selling proposition. But then, you\u2019re right, there\u2019s a second derivative order with respect to any commercial opportunities that we could create around that surface. We\u2019re not ready to talk into detail yet. We\u2019re still a ways off from announcing the exact start date. We\u2019re learning a lot on the technical capacity that we currently have and any additional changes we need to make. But, we\u2019re on the path to getting there and I'm excited by it. I think it\u2019s going to be a great new service to our customers when we get there. Operator : And now, moving on to the next caller, and that will come from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi, you may be muted. Please unmute. Savi Syth : Good morning. Sorry about that. I know it\u2019s early stages, but I was wondering if you could help me understand a little bit more on the 2020 cost outlook. It seems that you kind of -- it almost seems that you\u2019re indicating that you over-earned this year because the cost is about catching up your current market share, but you also had a lot of cost by paying kind of over time for your current -- for all your crusades to meet the capacity needs this time. So, kind of wondering how it adds that incremental 1 point and how should we think about that cost outlook for next year? Glen Hauenstein : Good morning, Savi, and thanks for the question. The pressure that you cited and certainly what we\u2019ve called out going back to some conferences this fall was real. And as I articulated, we felt a little bit like bursting at the seams with all the passenger loads and some of the weather pressures that we saw. And undoubtedly, some of the staffing investments that we\u2019ll make will help mitigate some of that. But it\u2019s really about arming our people with the tools and resources they need to serve our customers in an expanding base. Our total revenues are up 15% over the last couple of years, and there is investments in that process that we need to continue to make in order to drive the quality that our customers are used to, to continue to earn that revenue. So, it goes beyond that. And as we said, we\u2019ll give more details at Investor Day. Ed Bastian : Savi, this is Ed, if I could add to that. We\u2019ve given a long-term trajectory on non-fuel cost of being around 2%. And when we can go below that, we do as we\u2019ve been I think for the last couple of years. That means occasionally, it might be above that. But I think our long-term trend line is -- 2% is a good target for us. I would not say that we over-earned this year. We certainly had that cost both in Q3 and Q4, related to the high volumes that we had. I think, this is about as much infrastructure investments that continue to better serve the growth, whether it be in airports and technology and in our people, and our service providers as it is dealing with the secure volumes of a very busy summer. So, this is a long-term investment that I\u2019m confident is going to have long-term returns. Savi Syth : That makes sense. If I might just ask a smaller cost question on 4Q, just on Trainer, just expectations there? I might have missed it. Paul Jacobson : Sorry, Savi. On Trainer? Glen Hauenstein : Yes. Paul Jacobson : Trainer is expected to have a slight loss for the quarter that\u2019s built into our fuel price guidance. We have some scheduled maintenance on a couple of units that\u2019s going on now that's expected to be completed in early November. But overall, the refinery continues to operate well. Operator : And next, we\u2019ll hear from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : Ed or Glen, when we think back to simple fares in 2005, I\u2019m wondering why that failed. And at its core, this is really a loyalty question. Is there a thought to maybe trying something like that again, given such clear product distinctions between their types and the segmentation era? Glen Hauenstein : Hunter, I think simple fares might have been too simple, and maybe as an industry we weren\u2019t ready for it. We didn\u2019t have the sophistication to really manage it well. And I think that\u2019s really the infrastructures we're putting in place now and how we see the evolution of pricing occurring over the next year. One of the things that you would have to admit about the industry in general is it\u2019s transactional and it's not really trusted very well. And I think we learned that because sometimes you go look and the flight you want to take on a Monday morning is $500 and sometimes it\u2019s $1200 and sometimes it's yet another number. And I think, what we're doing with all of the data that we\u2019re collecting is we're trying to bring more stability to that pricing model over time. And it's not really simple fares but it's more reliable fares. And it's not a revolution, it's an evolution. So, we're on a journey on this and we're trying to be less transactional and more customer-driven. And we\u2019re not at our destination yet and it will take several more years for us to get there. But I love the question because I do think it's a sense of how do we become a better consumer brand. And I think one of the things that we have to do is to have trust from our consumers. Hunter Keay : That's great. Thank you, Glen. And then, Ed, maybe for you. The third runway Heathrow, is that a done deal? And how can you leverage the airport work that you've been doing here in the U.S. with your ownership stake in Virgin and maybe have a seat at the table for how that extension -- how that looks over there as it happens? Thanks. Ed Bastian : I don't believe it's a done deal. I think, it's certainly something that's needed. I think, there is a lot of work going into the termination of the cost, the long-term impact to the city. We're going to provide certainly through Virgin our perspective on a build there, but we are a relatively small share of overall Heathrow. So, I\u2019m not sure we're going to have much of a voice in that process. Operator : Now, we will go to a question from Jamie Baker with JP Morgan. Jamie Baker : For Glen, the 10% PRASM premium, that's driven by about 20% domestically and basically flattish on the international, if I\u2019m correct. Why don\u2019t you think you get a RASM premium on international? Glen Hauenstein : I think it depends on the entity. Of course, each international entity is different. We get a premium in the transatlantic. We have not gotten our premium historically in Latin America, and I think that's one of the reasons that we are so excited about the LATAM transaction as our offering really wasn't what it needed to be to drive revenue premiums being the number four carrier. So, I think that was one of the things that we thought we needed to have a structural improvement in our offering in Latin America in order ultimately to drive significant premiums. And I think we achieve that in the long run, not today, but over the long run by securing LATAM. And then, in the Pacific, there is a lot of different -- it's a small entity for us and we have made significant improvements there. But, our stage length is really working against us. And I think, as we transition through to Haneda next year, we've told our investors we\u2019re on a multiyear transformation. And one of the things we'll talk about at our Investor Day is we\u2019re arriving at our destination finally in Asia, and that will give us the building blocks I think to drive premium with the products that will drive premium and with the introduction of the Delta One suites and the premium economy. I think, we're well-positioned to drive premiums in the Pacific as well over time. Jamie Baker : And second on loyalty, maybe for Paul, maybe for Ed. I think, everyone recognizes that loyalty represents a moat around the business. But, it's not clear to me how some of your Amex assumptions, the path towards that $7 billion figure, how that gets altered by a U.S. recession? I've got all the data on what happens to air travel demand. But, what are your recessionary assumptions in terms of quarterly mileage sales, card openings, consumer spending? I mean, I know loyalty is more durable than air travel, but I still don't know how durable. Ed Bastian : Well, Jamie, I'll take that. Obviously, we don't know what the economic outlook over the next five years. And the $7 billion number that we have disclosed is our target together with Amex, over this timeframe. It doesn't necessarily indicate that's recession proof. I mean, certainly, it's sensitive to spend, probably the single biggest element that we have in there. But, we also have modeled what happened in 2009 and how quickly spend did return. It's one of the reasons why we're creating not just greater loyalty through the card and the brand portfolio but also getting avenues for currency to be used as dollars, and the technology work that we have. And I think it's actually been one of the real nice innovations we brought to the market this year is that we're giving alternative use for currency, and people can spend and conserve cash. So, I would say it's our target. Could there be bumps along that way? Certainly. It's not a flat guarantee. But, I think it's our best estimate together with Amex what we expect to see over the next five years. And at the same time, even through the process, this year while you have some economic concerns, I wouldn't say significant concerns in terms of consumer spend, we're still seeing growth on the card portfolio at double digits. Jamie Baker : Is there a quarterly minimum in terms of what Amex is obligated to purchase in terms of miles or is there a scenario where spend was soft enough, they would have enough miles and they could just drop to zero for a period for Delta? Ed Bastian : We're not going to get into any details of the contract, Jamie, as you can appreciate. Jamie Baker : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you, everyone. Operator : Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley will have the next question. Rajeev Lalwani : Ed, Paul, a question for you. You've provided some good color on costs into next year. But, as we think about just over the next several years, how do we get comfortable with your ability to bring those costs back down to that target 2% or below level when you've got a pilot deal that's out there and you are likely going to be decelerating some of that capacity growth back to more normalized levels, if you will? Ed Bastian : Rajeev, I'll take that. The 2% number is what we've given you in the past and we continue to see that hold. One of the -- we'll provide a lot more color when we get to Investor Day as to how we see the 2020 cost outlook. But, one of the pressure points we're also facing in 2020 is that our gauge in 2020 is actually going to be relatively flat year-over-year, and that's been certainly a source of productivity for us on unit cost. We expect to see that pick up again in \u201821. So, that's going to be another pressure that we're facing in the short term. But, we'll give you our perspective on that when we give you the details. But, we have faced our labor pressures in the past. We expect that whatever deal is cut with the pilots is going to be within the frame we talked about it. Rajeev Lalwani : Okay. And then, Glen, actually a follow-up for you. You talked about a pretty strong demand environment. The supply backdrop seems pretty favorable from what we can tell. At the same time, you're pointing to RASM that's nearly flattish, once you take out the card benefit. I know there are some puts and takes there. But, can you just reconcile those two dynamics they seem to be odds with one another? Glen Hauenstein : I think, we were trying to get to that in the call. So, I appreciate the question that our lift PRASM, which is what's coming off the tickets, is really very flat between 3Q and 4Q at about 1.5%. So, the TRASM decline between 3Q and 4Q is really a previous year accounting adjustments, which didn't occur this year. And so, that's what we were trying to say in the call. I'm sorry if we weren't clear enough. But, thanks for the question because I do want everybody to understand that the revenue coming off the tickets themselves is positive, it's consistent at about 1.5 up between 3Q and 4Q. Operator : Now, moving onto Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. And Joseph, please go ahead with your question. Joseph DeNardi : [Technical Difficulty] Operator : I am sorry. Joseph, we\u2019re not hearing your question clearly. Joseph DeNardi : Is that better? Operator : Yes. Please continue. Joseph DeNardi : [Technical Difficulty] at the Amex partnership a lot more that you used do. Analysts asked about it a lot more. I still think investor don't know what to [Technical Difficulty] on the valuation of the company. So, it suggests that [Technical Difficulty]. So, I'm wondering when do you think you'd be in a position to consider [Technical Difficulty] so investors can see profitability from a financial standpoint? Thank you. Ed Bastian : Joe, you were still breaking up. If I understood your question, it's along the lines of, are we prepared to increase the segment disclosure relative to the American Express loyalty component of our business. Is that right? Joseph DeNardi : Yes. That's right. Ed Bastian : Yes. We're always evaluating how we provide the best insight for our investors into the drivers of our opportunities for the future. We've improved some of the disclosure. And certainly while we have to work within the confines of our contractual obligations to Amex, the confidentiality provisions, yes, I think it's a valid question, it's a fair question. It's something we need to continue to think about how we get greater visibility. It's an very important source of revenue for us today, it's certainly a growing source, probably growing faster than most other revenue components we have in the business, and it's certainly margin accretive. We can debate how you want to cost those miles, but it's certainly highly accretive to us. So, I think it's a fair question. I don't have an answer for you quite yet, but we're going to keep looking at. Joseph DeNardi : And then, Ed, given the value of the Amex agreement and how valuable you think it can be, why isn't Sandeep's role a C level position? Ed Bastian : Did Sandeep ask you to ask that question? Sandeep and the loyalty team are incredible contributors and highly valued. And I wouldn't go on title or definition. I've got great visibility to Sandeep and I see him just about every week on it. So, he\u2019s a great asset to the Company as well as his entire team. Joseph DeNardi : Thank you. Operator : And now, we'll move to a question from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Catherine O\u2019Brien: So, year-to-date, you've been seeing some nice growth in your -- some of your non-ticket revenue categories like travel related services and, of course, loyalty revenue with the new Amex deal. Could you maybe walk us through some of the puts and takes on these non-ticket revenue streams into next year? Is there still room left to add some more products or should we expect to see growth accelerate in some of your ancillary businesses? Thanks. Ed Bastian : Well, I'll talk a little bit about premium products and maybe turn that over to Gil for some of the ancillaries like the MRO. Clearly, we see room for growth there. And that's been on a different trajectory than base ticket fares. And as you saw, we grew premium products by 9% in the quarter, which was above the, of course, average of the total revenue growth at 6.5%. So, we continue to see that moving forward. And it's really, we think, our ability to a, price those products, given the increasing demand that we see from consumers on them, but b, also continuing to increase the number of channels we distribute them through. And as you know, we've been working to do that more on our digital channels but also through -- there are travel management companies and our partnerships and through the OTAs. And we're seeing some great early results on that. But, it's got ways to go over the next years -- months and years. So, we continue to see that as -- being able to grow even through maybe a challenging economic environment. Gil West : Yes. Hi. This is Gil. I would just add -- first, just a shout out to our tech ops team for -- I mean, they are the best in the business. But the MRO business for us year-to-date is up about $120 million year-over-year, about 23%. So, we're seeing strong growth in the current year. As you look forward, some of the investments that we've made in terms of capacity for new generation engines, in particular the Rolls-Royce Trent engine and the Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan, those volumes start to ramp next year as well, albeit those will mature in three or four years. But, we'll benefit from some of that tailwind as well in the MRO business as we move forward. Catherine O\u2019Brien: That's great. Thanks. And then, maybe just one quick follow-up on costs. And I think, you already alluded to this Ed, but I just want to make sure I've got it right. In your 2020 CASM outlook, the 2% to 3%, there is a potential new pilot deal that is contemplated in that number. Is that correct? Ed Bastian : Katie, I'll take that. We are not going to comment to pilot deal or in any nature. 2% to 3% is our best estimate where our cost will be next year. We're not going to get into the details relative to our negotiations. Catherine O\u2019Brien: Okay, understood. Thank you very much. Jill Greer : And Jake, we're going to have time for one more question from the analyst. Operator : Great. And that last analyst question will come from David Vernon with Bernstein. Ran Yang : Hi. This is Ran Yang speaking on behalf of David Vernon. So, just to clarify talk go back to the CASM-Ex guide into 2020. The one point step up, is that something that you can potentially offset with other cost initiatives, like One Delta? Paul Jacobson : One Delta continues to pay big dividends for us. And while we expect the level of investment back into the product and the infrastructure as Ed articulated, we're always striving to find some of that productivity. And as we've said before, we'll detail more about the 2020 cost outlook at Investor Day in December. Ran Yang : Got it. Thank you. Jill Greer : That's going to wrap up the analyst portion of the phone call. I will now turn it over to Tim Mapes, our Chief Communications Officer for the analysts -- or the media portion. Tim Mapes : Good morning, everybody, and thank you to the members of the media for holding on. We have a little bit under 10 minutes of time to take questions. I'll just remind everybody, as we said earlier with analysts, please if you would limit your questions to one and so we can get through as many of these as quickly as possible. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll hear first from Elliott Blackburn with Argus Media. Elliott Blackburn : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Curious how the Trainer refinery is going to adjust to the higher renewable fuel blending requirements that the Trump administration is proposing begin next year? Paul Jacobson : Good morning, Elliot. This is Paul. We are in a full compliance with our RINs requirements under the RFS standard and have done a good job of managing through that volatility that we've seen over the last several years. And I'm confidence that the team will be able to continue to address that. We continue to advocate on behalf of small and independent refiners that long-term solutions have to be identified. But, we\u2019re managing through that in the short term. Elliott Blackburn : So, do you think that this -- it doesn't sound like you are concerned that this added cost is going to affect the refinery\u2019s kind of viability long term? Paul Jacobson : We certainly think that it can result in added costs. We don't believe necessarily that it affects the full viability. But, it does have an economic impact to the region and our ability to continue to drive those results at the refinery. Operator : And now, we'll move to the next question and that will come from David Koenig with Associated Press. David Koenig : Hey. Good morning. This is for Ed. You gave a figure on TV for hiring this year and next year. Can you go over those targets and how many will be pilots for example? And then, overall, how much of that hiring is just replacing people who retire or leave and how much of it is actually pure growth? Ed Bastian : Sure, David. We haven't given out the specifics by job classification for next year. But, we've been hiring at a rate of about 6,000 new employees coming into the Company for the last couple of years, and we expect again going forward, next year, at a similar level. Pilots are going to be increasing in numbers due to retirements. The retirement age really starts to ramp up in the next two to three years. And so, those numbers are going to grow as well as to accommodate some of the growth that we've seen in the business. And one of the things that we'll be doing a bit differently than we did this past year is we're going to be hiring earlier in the year and continue to keep the hiring going through the year rather than have it in more discrete period. So, we'll have all of our new hires in position hopefully ready to handle as much of the new volume that's going to be coming in next year, not the [indiscernible]. In total, I'd say the -- probably at least half of the 6,000 we're talking about are retirement, replacement of workers that are retiring, half to two-thirds; and then, there is kind of some growth as well. David Koenig : Okay. I'm a little unclear about pilots. Will you grow the overall number of pilots, or next summer you'll have more? Okay. Ed Bastian : We just haven't given the number, but we're going to be growing our pilot hiring too. Yes. David Koenig : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Operator : And next, we'll hear from Ted Reed with Forbes. Ted Reed : I have two questions. First for Glen, if I look at what you're doing this quarter, it seems like you're growing at southern most major airport on the East Coast in Miami and then northern most in Boston. Is that a good way to look at it? Glen Hauenstein : I don't think we've announced any plans to grow Miami yet. But, as I outlined in the earlier call, I think, we will add some key spokes into Miami. It won't be giant. But, I think we have had a successful growth in Boston. And as you know, this past quarter, we just took back our terminal. That terminal was constructed almost 15 years ago and opened, and this is the first time that we've occupied the terminal that was built for Delta. And I would assume that we will be the leading carrier in Boston in terms of revenue in 2020. So, yes, we've done a lot of growth in Boston. Ted Reed : Secondly for Ed. As you look at the impact of the tariffs, is your response -- your ability to respond going to be based on Mobile and taking more production from Mobile? And do you have any priority in getting the production from Mobile? Ed Bastian : Well, certainly Mobile is going to be very important for us going forward. And that's -- yes, that's going to be the focus of our domestic strategy to be getting our 220s, our 321s via Mobile as Airbus continues to ramp up that production capability. I'm not going to get into any longer term ideas we have because obviously it doesn't necessarily help you on the wide bodies. But, we're evaluating options there. And as I said, our goal is to mitigate any potential tariff exposure. Operator : Now, Leslie Josephs with CNBC, we'll have the next question. Leslie Josephs : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. This is about basic economy. I've been noticing the fare differences between main cabin and basic seem to be going up, I mean across various routes when you guys started -- I know you started a long time ago. But, maybe a couple of years ago, it was like $30, $40, now seeing sometimes $100. Is that kind of across the board? What kind of benefit are you seeing from that? Ed Bastian : Well, basic economy is not something that we want to grow. It's not really a premium product. And as we've outlined before, defensive product against ULCCs, we want to have best-in-class product whatever people's needs are. And for people who only care about the lowest fare possible, I think, we have by far the best offering. And the differential between that and the main cabin, it hasn't been an intentional shift in separating those out. But, I think what we're testing in many cases is what are people willing to pay for that. And sometimes in business markets, it's a bigger differential. And I think maybe that's what you're looking. At a market basket level of all markets, the difference has only been a couple of dollars different. But, I think at individual market levels, it may be greater. Leslie Josephs : Okay. When did that start, that larger gap? It was about $30, $40 just a couple of years ago. Ed Bastian : Yes. I think you'd have to give us what markets you're looking at because each one of the markets is managed individually. Leslie Josephs : Okay. Like transcon, for example. Ed Bastian : All right. Well, again, I think, we can get back to you with some more details. But, the intent has not been to move up the ladder significantly. Operator : We'll take our final question today from John Biers with AFP. John Biers : Hi. Thank you for taking my call. We've seen a fair bit of data showing that there is weakness in the manufacturing sector in the U.S. right now. There is a strike that's been going on for weeks now in Detroit, which is one of your hubs. Are you seeing any weakness right now in your demand forecast looking forward for the U.S. in general? There's -- obviously we've had more talk about possible recession in the next couple of years. Any shift at all, any weakness compared with a few months ago? Ed Bastian : John, this is Ed. No, not at all. We had a -- as we've mentioned a number of times on this call, we had record summer in terms of both volumes and revenues. So, all time high revenues for us. And the domestic system is what produced those records. Our domestic revenues were up 8% in the third quarter. And we continue to see advanced bookings, the domestic consumer being quite strong. We expect the holiday period to be a strong period. Looking ahead, we don't have a great view into 2020 since it's pretty early for us on our booking curve, but the -- our business is heavily levered to the U.S. consumer. And the U.S. consumer is doing quite well and is preferring Delta. John Biers : Thank you. Glen Hauenstein : With that, we'll conclude today's call. As has been mentioned earlier, we look forward to seeing everybody on December 11th and 12th here in Atlanta. And we're grateful for your time today. Thank you. Operator : And once again, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference for today. We do thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

My name is Shannon and I will be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma'am. Jill Greer : Thanks Shannon. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us on our December quarter end full year call. Joining us from Atlanta today are our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Paul Jacobson. Our entire leadership team is here in the room with us for the Q&A. Ed will open the call and give an overview of Delta's financial performance, Glen will then address the revenue environment, and Paul will conclude with a review of our cost performance and cash flow. [Operator Instructions] Today's discussion does contain forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in our SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. All results exclude special items unless otherwise noted and you can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, Ed? Ed Bastian : Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Earlier Delta reported our full year results including a December quarter pretax profit of $1.4 billion which is up $240 million compared to last year. Our EPS in the quarter increased 31% to $1.70 with pretax margins expanding 140 basis points to 12.4%. The December quarter performance was a great finish to what was truly an outstanding year on all fronts. Strategically, with the American Express renewal and the announcement of LATAM and Wheels Up partnerships, operationally with best-in-class completion factor and on-time performance, and financially with industry leading revenue profits and cash flow. 2019 was the best year in our history. The top line grew 7.5% to $47 billion, positioning Delta as the largest carrier by revenue in the world. We delivered $6.2 billion in pretax income, an improvement of more than $1 billion over 2018, setting a new record for Delta and the U.S. airline industry. Full year earnings per share improved 30% over the prior year and we generated $4.2 billion of free cash flow with $3 billion returned to owners. These results simply would not be possible without the incredible work of our Delta team. I am pleased we'll recognize our employees' performance in 2019 with $1.6 billion in profit sharing. This marks the highest profit sharing in Delta's history and is the sixth consecutive year of $1 billion or more in profit sharing. We could not be happier for our people. For our customers, we continue to run the world's most reliable airline. We ended the year with 165 cancel-free days across the entire Delta branded system with 281 zero canceled days on our mainline operations, representing an entire month's worth of improvement over the record performance that we set in 2018. Recently, Delta was named 2019's Most On-Time North American airline by Flightglobal for the third year in a row. Exceptional operational performance along with unmatched customer service is why more people than ever are choosing to fly Delta. In 2019, we flew 204 million customers, a 6% increase over 2018. And over the last decade, we've significantly improved the quality and reliability of Delta's operations. And as a result, our customer satisfaction scores have more than tripled. Domestic Net Promoter Score is now regularly in the 50s, with nearly five point improvements over the course of 2019. Delta's continued investment in our operations, products, service, airports and technology are reshaping customers perception of our brand and our journey to improve continues daily, and we plan to keep climbing by powering our culture of service through technology. Last week, I had the honor of delivering the opening keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show, where we outlined Delta's vision for the future of travel, unveiling innovative technologies to better serve customers and give our employees the best tools to use in the world. Delta is leading the industry in every dimension. In five short years, Delta will celebrate its 100th anniversary. It's amazing to think how far we've come, but even more exciting to look ahead. 2020 is off to a good start. The U.S. consumer and travel demand remain healthy, our brand has strong momentum, and we have a pipeline of commercial initiatives that support another year of revenue growth in excess of GDP. Consistent with our plan that we outlined at Investor Day last month, we expect to grow 2020 revenue by 4% to 6%. This is on top of the 15% growth that we've delivered over the last two years. Our full year earnings outlook of $6.75 to $7.75 per share positions Delta for the sixth straight year of pre-tax profits in excess of $5 billion. Free cash flow is also expected to remain strong at $4 billion in 2020. This would bring Delta's three year cumulative free cash flow to over $10 billion by the end of this year. By leveraging a solid financial foundation with increasingly diverse revenue streams and building brand momentum, we are demonstrating an unprecedented level of earnings and free cash flow consistency for this industry. This is enabling us to reinvest in our business at a level that others cannot match. This reinvestment is extending our competitive advantages and when combined with a great brand powered by the very best people in the business, we have the engine to drive meaningful long-term value for our customers, our employees and our owners. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Glenn and to Paul to go through the details of the quarter. Glen Hauenstein : Thanks, Ed, and good morning. First, I'd like to thank the entire Delta team for delivering a record year in 2019. It's their hard work that enabled $47 billion in revenue, an increase of more than $3 billion over prior year. The 7.5% growth was broad-based with strength in both business and leisure, improvements in domestic and international, and double-digit growth in loyalty and MRO. Total unit revenues improved 2.8% sustaining our revenue premium to the industry of more than 110% and outpacing non-fuel unit cost growth of 2%. We continue to diversify the top line with 53% of our revenue generated by premium products, loyalty and other non-ticket revenue sources. Premium product revenue grew 9% in the year to $15 billion. We've continued to improve and invest in the premium experience and we are seeing increasing product affinity. On average 70% of customers that fly in premium products purchase an equal or better product on a future trip. We are providing SkyMiles Members more options to use miles anywhere they can use cash with Delta. Since launching, upsell with miles a little over a year ago 1.2 million customers have redeemed miles, contributing $135 million of incremental revenue and we continue to expand capabilities, most recently with the ability to pay for bag fees using miles. Brand preference for Delta is stronger than ever. We are seeing momentum in customer satisfaction scores and in 2019 Business Travel News named Delta, the world's best airline for business travel for the ninth year in a row. More customers are choosing to interact directly with us with 52% of trips purchased directly from Delta during the year. Digital is our fastest-growing distribution channel. Mobile revenues grew by 35%, driven by an active user base of over 24 million customers. Total loyalty revenues grew 18%. We added the highest number of SkyMiles Members in our history with over 6 million new enrollments. We also acquired 1.1 million new co-brand cards setting a new record and marking the third consecutive year of more than 1 million co-brand acquisitions. We deepened our customer engagement to drive 12% growth in mileage redemptions in co-brand spend. This is the fifth year of double-digit growth for portfolio spend. In 2019, our renewed contract with American Express benefited revenue by approximately $500 million. Delta's close relationship with American Express is a strategic advantage that is truly unique. In 2019, the total contributions grew by 20% to $4.1 billion. We expect this to reach $4.4 billion in 2020 and grow to nearly $7 billion by 2023 on a combination of improved rates, continued acquisition momentum and spend growth. Enhancing customer loyalty and building trust is at the heart of our business. And together with American Express we are finding new and innovative ways to reward customers for their loyalty. Later this month we will be launching our new portfolio of card offerings. The redesigned cards deliver new and richer rewards that will continue to increase customer benefits and drive future card acquisitions. Turning to the December quarter. We delivered a strong close to the year with top line revenue growth of 7.2%. Total unit revenue growth of 2.4% beat guidance and marked our 11th consecutive quarter of improvement over prior year. Passenger unit revenue was up 1.4% over prior year led by strength in domestic and LATAM. Holiday travel came in ahead of expectations driven by strong consumer sentiment and a condensed booking period between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Domestically we saw strength in business and leisure demand with solid yield gains on peak travel days. Premium product revenue outpaced our expectations, growing 9% in the December quarter on top of last year's 10% growth. Domestically, revenue was up 7.7% on a 1.6% improvement in unit revenues. Corporate demand was strong at up 6% and premium products remain a key contributor, up 11% year-over-year. Similar to the September quarter, we saw revenue and margin improvement in every domestic hub with revenue up 10% in coastal hubs and 6% in core hubs. Internationally, revenue grew 2% on flat PRASM. LATAM was the best-performing entity with 6.3% PRASM improvement, a three point improvement sequentially. Brazil and Mexico both delivered double-digit PRASM gains. In the Atlantic, PRASM declined 1.6%, almost entirely driven by FX. Specific revenue stabilized on a three point sequential PRASM improvement. While China remains soft, trends improved in Japan and Delta Premium Select performed well as we continue our fleet and product transformation. With new and reconfigured aircraft now on 80% of our Pacific routes, we have the Delta One suite and Premium Select products in place. In the March quarter we expect total unit revenues to increase by 5% to 7% on unit revenues up flat to up 2%. The sequential change in unit revenues from the December quarter is due to lapping last year's American Express contract benefits and MRO engine volume timing. Importantly, PRASM growth remains consistent at approximately 1.5% in both 4Q 2019 and 1Q 2020. March quarter expected capacity growth includes approximately two points of leap year and the launch of service to India. In 2020, our plan of 4% to 6% revenue growth is driven by four areas; strengthening brand preference, better selling and servicing of our products, continuing to win with business and corporate travelers and driving increased loyalty with more customers. Corporate and leisure demand trends remain healthy. The overall outlook for corporate travel is positive. In our most recent survey 80% of travel managers expect to maintain or increase their spend in 2020. While momentum in premium product revenue is continuing in 2020 with the ongoing modernization of our wide-body fleet and improvements in how we sell and distribute premium products. We also expect additional growth from American Express and MRO albeit at a more moderate rate than in 2019. In our network we are expanding service and personal hubs, refocusing on opportunities in our core and developing our partnerships with LATAM. We expect to begin our Co-Chair relationship in the March quarter. In December we launched new service from JFK to Mumbai and revenue trends are ahead of forecast. We expect approximately a one point unit revenue pressure in the transatlantic as the route develops throughout the year. In the first half of the year Delta will consolidate Tokyo operations at the preferred downtown Haneda Airport. We will also shift Beijing service to the new Beijing Daxing Airport. These moves are strategically important and are the final steps in our multiyear restructuring journey in the Pacific. Over the last decade Delta has established a global scale advantage through an unprecedented network transformation and by building a leading portfolio of partnerships around the world. This evolution provides the foundation for an acceleration of returns over the next decade as we mature and grow investments in fleet, partners, facilities and technology. Delta's continued investment ensures that we extend our competitive advantages. Our culture, operational reliability, global network, customer loyalty and an investment-grade balance sheet to retain our leadership position in the industry. In closing, we delivered an outstanding 2019 and are off to a very strong start in 2020. And now I'll turn it over to Paul. Paul Jacobson : Thank you, Glenn. Good morning, everyone, and thank you also for joining us. In 2019 we delivered pre-tax income of $6.2 billion more than $1 billion improvement versus prior year and over $300 million higher than Delta's prior record. Pre-tax margin expanded by 160 basis points to 13.2%. Earnings grew 30% to $7.31 per share. Cash flow was also a key performance highlight. We generated over $4 billion in free cash flow while continuing to invest in our people, our fleet, our partners, and technology. These investments are generating strong returns with an after-tax return on invested capital of 16.2% in 2019. This represents nearly 500 basis points of improvement since 2010 all while doubling our invested capital base. In the December quarter, pretax margin expanded 140 basis points to 12.4%. This was above guidance on stronger unit revenue, lower fuel, and a net $80 million gain that resulted from selling our stake in GOL and beginning to unwind our relationship. Excluding this gain, pretax margin grew 70 basis points and earnings beat consensus by approximately $0.21. While total expense grew 6.9% in the quarter half of that growth was due to pension expense, the markup of benefit-related balance sheet obligations, and profit sharing from the growth in profits. These cost increases were partially offset by lower fuel expense which declined $370 million, primarily on lower market fuel prices. Non-fuel unit costs were up 4.4% in the quarter in line with our guidance. For the full year, non-fuel unit cost came in at 2% consistent with our long-term target, despite the pressures we saw in the back half of the year. For the March quarter, we expect non-fuel unit cost to increase 2% to 3%. While fuel has been volatile over the last month, based on yesterday's price, we expect March quarter fuel price of $2 to $2.20 per gallon in line to slightly above prior year. Combined with the outlook on revenue Glen provided, we expect March quarter pretax margin to be roughly flat year-over-year. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, during 2019, we generated $8.4 billion of operating cash and invested $4.5 billion back into the business. Free cash flow of $4.2 billion resulted in nearly 90% of net income converted to free cash flow. As outlined at Investor Day, we are planning capital spending of $4.5 billion in 2020 as we continue to replace our fleet and invest in product and technology. These investments are transforming Delta's fleet to drive margin benefits through higher customer satisfaction, increased premium seats, and significant fuel efficiency improvements which is helping to drive our sustainability goals. Returns on these investments are strong and the compounding benefits of reinvestments support long-term growth. Delta's investment-grade balance sheet remains an important competitive advantage. Including the debt we raised during the quarter, our leverage ratio was 1.7 times at year end. This puts us at the low end of our targeted adjusted debt-to-EBITDA range of one and a half to two and a half times. Bad debt issuance was $1.5 billion of unsecured debt made up of five and 10-year notes. The blended unsecured rate of 3.24% is the lowest for these durations in Delta's history. The proceeds funded the majority of the acquisition of 20% equity stake in LATAM. With LATAM tender now complete, we will begin recognizing 20% of LATAM's earnings in the non-operating line beginning in the March quarter. Moving to pension, we are actively managing our obligation through a combination of funding and asset returns. In the December quarter, we contributed an incremental $500 million of voluntary contributions into the plan, bringing elective contributions in 2019 to $1 billion. For the year, planned asset returns were about 19.5% fueled by strength in the U.S. equity markets which will drive favorability in our 2020 pension expense. And while lower discount rates impacted the liability, our funding strategy and strong returns helped improve our funded status of 75%. This is a 700 basis point improvement over prior year and nearly double the funded status in 2012. In 2019, Delta's unfunded liability also improved by $1 billion. We plan to make $500 million of elective contributions in 2020. Under airline relief recall, we have no mandatory contributions through 2024. Strong cash generation allows us to reinvest in the business, while also addressing these balance sheet obligations and simultaneously consistently returning capital to shareholders. In the December quarter, we returned $225 million in share repurchases and $259 million in dividends for a total of $3 billion in 2019. We ended 2019 with $1 billion remaining on our repurchase authorization, which we expect to complete by the middle of this year. It is our powerful brand, unmatched competitive advantages, and the collective efforts of all Delta people that allow us to continue to deliver industry-leading results and drive long-term values for our owners, our customers and for our people. And I'm truly excited for the year ahead. Consistent with the guidance changes announced at Investor Day, we are no longer providing quarterly EPS, but are well on track to deliver full year earnings per share of $6.75 to $7.75 per share in 2020. And we expect another strong year of free cash flow with expectations for $4 billion, again this year, bringing our three-year cumulative free cash flow total to over $10 billion by the end of 2020. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jill to begin the Q&A. Jill Greer : Thanks, Paul. Shannon, we're ready for the question-and-answer period with the analysts, if you could give some instructions on how to get into queue. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from David Vernon of Bernstein. David Vernon : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for the time. So, Ed as you think about the decision to sort of accelerate the investments in technology and the experience maybe even going after some adjacent revenues in rideshare through partnership and that kind of thing is this \u2013 are these activities going to be funded kind of within the existing capital envelope? Or do you expect Delta to kind of maybe spend a little bit more over the next couple of years as you look on kind of executing the vision you laid out at CES? Ed Bastian : Hey, David. David, thanks. Yes. The capital that we spoke of at CES and the technology that we displayed is within the envelope that we've been working with in technology. One of the things that we've done over the last several years is upped our investment in technology, and we're now on a capital level running at about $500 million a year in technology. However, for the first couple of years of that, a lot of it was focused on infrastructure and resiliency and the data sets in data architecture that's now finally starting to be able to produce the type of technology and innovation that you're seeing. And so it's going to be more heavily weight going forward towards business and commercial application as compared to infrastructure. But it sits within the envelope we've been using. David Vernon : And maybe just as a quick follow-up as you think about the return on this incremental investment is this going to be sort of a gradual enhancement to the revenue premium that you earn? Or do you see some sort of step changes in opportunity along the way whether it's material cost out or revenue opportunities kind of within the next three to five years? Ed Bastian : I think it's both, David. Certainly the revenue opportunities are significant we do go through in this past year. We looked at what we thought our digital investments and new product offerings this year generated and we estimate about $200 million of incremental revenue, whether it be using SkyMiles as a currency to upsell, the new-generation shopping and booking tools that we have. Opportunities also sit on the cost front with better decision support in IROPs and optimizing the fleet and making certain that we're able to ensure that our crew are best utilized and any downtimes are minimized. And I could go on there's a long list of opportunities that we have. So I think it's going to be both a cost opportunity as well as a strong enhancement to the brand as we build closer and closer digital connections with our customers, 204 million customers a year. The only way you can build that connection with them at the personal level that they choose is digital and we're off to a great start. David Vernon : All right. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question will come from Helane Becker of Cowen. Helane Becker : Thanks very much operator. Hi, everybody and thank you very much for your time. Glenn, I know you said that you're seeing strong demand on the corporate side and I'm sure that's true. But I'm starting to hear from some companies that they're thinking about cutting expenses and asking their employees to rethink some travel and I'm wondering if you're seeing any signs of that among your top corporates? Or if you could just mention maybe where you're seeing the strength, if it's a particular industry group? Glen Hauenstein : No, I think we're seeing strength across the board. And we've heard this from time to time that people are worried about corporate spend and travel but it seems to be in a very good position as we head into 2020. And as a matter of fact, last year we did see a little bit of weakness in manufacturing but we're starting to lap that and we're starting to see some positive momentum coming out of that sector. So generally, we're seeing some very good signs from our corporate. Ed Bastian : Yes I think the only thing I'd add to that Helane, this is Ed, is we're certainly seeing some weakness as Glenn touched on in Asia with China issues and some of the tariff discussions that's bled over into Korea and a few of the other Asian economies. But fundamentally Glenn's right, the health of our businesses in the U.S. and the U. S. corporate is doing quite well. Helane Becker : Okay, okay. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up to that. Would you rather see faster growth in leisure traffic or faster growth in corporate traffic? Glen Hauenstein : We've experienced both. I think we like them both equally. And I think what in leisure is really \u2013 what we're seeing in leisure really is an interesting separation of people who are looking for quality and willing to pay higher fares or upsell into better products and services at the highest quality airline in the U.S. So we see an increase in yields, in leisure which is very good for the industry. Helane Becker : Right. So what you're seeing is leisure travelers buying up and fewer people in that basic economy bucket, is that a way to interpret your comment? Glen Hauenstein : That's a way to look at it. Helane Becker : Okay. All right. Great. Well, okay, thanks very much for your help. I appreciate it. Operator : And our next question will come from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : Hey, good morning. Thanks. Helane, just segued nicely into my question actually. You mentioned leisure seeking quality. Glen, is there a point where you view basic economy as being brand dilutive to the point where maybe it doesn't really fit the Delta concept anymore as you guys try to focus on that higher quality? Glen Hauenstein : I think from the beginning we've been really clear that we want to have the best-in-class products and services no matter what your travel needs are. And I think we would always see for entry-level customers who are only sensitive to price that we would have best-in-class there. As a matter of fact you might think that our overinvestment is highest in basic economy, but that's the entry point. And once they see the quality of service the Delta people provide I think they stay with us throughout their entire life cycle. And that's an important product for us to continue and maintain. Hunter Keay : Okay. And then if you think big picture take a step back for a second, think over the next five to 10 years, would you ever get so comfortable with your loyalty and value proposition to intentionally drive down your load factors, just a few points with an eye on driving RASM pretty much entirely through driving the yield premium, which -- so the idea would be really you change the overall feel of the flying experience with less crowds and less pricing volatility to really truly differentiate yourself as a premium brand and feel airline? Glen Hauenstein : I think we're always looking at what that is. And I think we've taken steps really structurally. Let's say we invented comfort plus in the domestic arena. I think what we would see maybe is the continued adoption and demand for that product builds over time that we might create more of that on existing fleets, which would take the density out. I can't see us ever wanting to fly with empty seats. I can't see us wanting to sell a plane that is meeting the demands of our customer base that might include more premium even than we have today. Hunter Keay : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Andrew Didora of Bank of America. Andrew Didora : Hi, good morning, everyone. I actually had a follow-up question on the tech investments. I guess the $500 million you're spending on tech CapEx, how do you think about the ROI needed on that spend relative to say on a new plane order or plane refresh? Glen Hauenstein : Well, Andrew we need to do both, right? This is not -- we're not trading off technology for planes. So we need to have continued enhancement of our fleet. That's clearly where the bulk of our CapEx goes is into our fleet and the modification of our aircraft. We're going to be taking 80 new airplanes into the fleet this year. And those -- but those fleet investments are also then facilitating technology as we bring new technology on board the fleet. So I don't look at them as differentiated or trade-offs. We've got an overall CapEx budget that we look at as a company. We try to stay within the 50% threshold plus or minus of operating cash. And that's how we get there. Now we do certainly look at ROI and returns on every one of our digital investments and capital initiatives. And I'm pleased to say they've been producing largely the results we'd expect. Andrew Didora : Great. Thank you. And Glen I know in the press release and you've been breaking out the domestic results by both core hubs and coastal hubs. As you think about growing your network over the next one to two years, what segment of those do you see the biggest capacity opportunities in? And then as a follow-up can you just -- I assume the core hubs are Atlanta, Detroit, Minneapolis, and Salt Lake, but do you see any of the coastal markets moving into the core bucket anytime soon? Thank you. Glen Hauenstein : Well, I think they're core; they're just not geographically centered. So, your ability to connect traffic when you're in Seattle is a lot less than when you're in Salt Lake City or Atlanta or the other ones you named. So, we have really used our first-mover advantage post-merger to take advantage of having the opportunity to consolidate positions in some of the key coastal markets like Seattle, Boston, Los Angeles, New York. But we did that a little bit at the expense of growing connectivity in our interior hubs. And so over the next several years, we'll be working on continuing to improve the products and services we offer at the coastal hubs, but really refocusing a little bit on growing the interior hubs to improve the connectivity of the airline. Andrew Didora : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank. Michael Linenberg : Hey, good morning everyone. I guess just two quick ones here. Paul I just want to make sure I heard you right the LATAM running that through the P&L. I know it closed late in the fourth quarter, but I guess nothing really shows up in the fourth quarter. Is it beginning in the March quarter, did I hear you right on that? Paul Jacobson : That's correct Mike. Beginning in the March quarter. Michael Linenberg : Okay. And then with respect to getting to the 20%, as I recall, I don't know if there was a sort of the conversation about whether or not it was going to be one or two board seats. Do you have a better sense? Do you know whether or not you have two board seats at LATAM as a result of that? Has that been figured out? Ed Bastian : Yes. We have two board seats Mike. Michael Linenberg : Okay, great. Great quarter. Thank you. Ed Bastian : Thank you. Thanks Mike. Operator : And we'll now hear from Jamie Baker of JPMorgan. Jamie Baker : Hey good morning everybody. First question for Glen and it's a follow-up to a topic that we discussed last quarter regarding the potential to generate an international RASM premium at some point. I'm curious if the fourth quarter results or the first quarter outlook shows any progress in this regard. And secondly does the full year guide have any specific assumptions? Or should we treat any potential evidence of an international RASM premium as upside to the guide? Glen Hauenstein : I think we're continually working to improve our international unit revenues and I think this fourth quarter was -- we're moving in the right direction and we see those trends continuing into the first quarter. We can't see yet what our competitors are doing, but I think we have an opportunity to continue to increase our relative performance and our absolute performance as we go through 2020 and hopefully beyond what we have in our plan. Jamie Baker : Okay. Second for Ed. It's related to ESG. I know you spoke about the topic at Investor Day; you gave some examples of Delta's environmental consciousness. I'm not sure if you saw Larry Fink's letter this morning. I mean what I keep struggling with on this topic is fleet. We've commended your fleet strategy for some time now specifically running a higher average age than your competitors. I just have to wonder if we're on the cusp of that possibly coming back to haunt you and whether ESG compliance necessitates bringing the fleet age down which in turn has CapEx implications. I'm not quite sure how to phrase the question, but how would you respond to somebody telling you that your fleet strategy is incompatible with growing ESG mandates? How about that? Ed Bastian : It's an interesting way to put it Jamie. Listen, we take our ESG and very specifically our environmental and sustainability requirements and goals to heart. And hopefully you heard me not only at the Investor Day but also at CES I closed on that topic specifically. It's something that fleet plays a big part of candidly being somewhat of having an older our fleet actually has given us opportunities to move faster in that space maybe than others, every plane we put in. And we're putting in 80 new planes are 25% more fuel-efficient than the planes that we're retiring. We at Delta we're the only airline back in 2012 that voluntarily capped our carbon footprint at 2012 levels. No other airline has done anything like that. We're looking at ways by which we can go even more aggressively. Fleet is only \u2013 fleet is an important part of the solution, but there is many more things to this in terms of how we engage. And I think you're going to be hearing us talk more and more about that over the course of the year. I didn't get a chance to see Larry's letter though I did hear a little bit about it this morning. And I think \u2013 his message is right. Jamie Baker : That's helpful. I really appreciate it. And I know it's been a busy morning. I wasn't calling you up for not having seen the letter yet. You got bigger things to deal with. Thanks again great quarter. Bye-bye. Ed Bastian : Thanks, Jamie. Operator : And our next question will come from Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey. Thanks for taking the questions. Can you clarify your revenue growth guidance versus your RASM guidance into the first quarter? It feels like based on what schedules are showing the implied RASM guidance is flattish, whereas your explicit RASM guidance is up one. Is that just a lower refinery year-over-year? Or what accounts for that difference? Jill Greer : Hey, Duane, it's Jill. The refinery sales are slightly lower year-over-year, but we exclude those from TRASM anyways. And so I think you're just \u2013 they're scheduled. There's a completion factor adjustment you have to make to schedule, but the revenue growth that we're looking at is a solid 5% to 7% in the first quarter, the total revenue growth. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay. Great. And then just on the pension, I understand you expect a tailwind this year. But can you just talk explicitly about what pension expense was in 2019 and what you expect it to be in 2020? Thanks for taking the questions. Glen Hauenstein : Yeah. So, thanks Duane. We had mentioned going in that we had about $250 million of pressure year-over-year in 2019 as a result of the pension returns in 2018. While we haven't given specific guidance we \u2013 if you look at year-over-year, we were up about I think 16% in 2017. So, you can look back and see the sensitivity around that. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Joe Caiado of Credit Suisse. Joe Caiado : Hey. Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. My first question just on the LATAM partnership, apologies if I missed it and Glen, you may have talked about it, but I think the code share with some of the affiliates slated to begin here in Q1. Can you just give us an update on where you are with those government approvals and when in Q1 you think you can launch that? And just as a quick follow-up to that, is there a rough estimate that you could share with us on expected 2020 revenue contribution from LATAM? Glen Hauenstein : I'll start with the first one, which is easier is that. No we're not going to share that today. And the second issue it's by country. And I believe this week we received the ability to code in Colombia. We expect Peru and Ecuador to follow shortly. And then the longer \u2013 a little bit longer tent in the pole. So those should all be up and running like in 1Q. A little bit longer pole in the tent is Brazil and Chile, which we expect later this year. Joe Caiado : Got it. Thank you for that. And then just a quick one for Paul on CASM-Ex, your Q1 guidance right in line with the full year. Should we expect that to be fairly level loaded through the year? Or are there any big sort of moving pieces that you expect in the year that could drive some quarterly swings in that 2% to 3% trajectory? Paul Jacobson : Yes, Joe what I would say is we're obviously not going to give quarterly guidance on CASM for the rest of the year. But as a general rule, if you look at our CASM trajectory in past years it's been pretty skewed with a lot of volatility. We've taken a conscious effort in 2020 to try to balance that across to make that cost performance more disciplined throughout the year and that's very intentional. Joe Caiado : Okay. I appreciate that. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Our next question will come from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good morning, everyone and congratulations on a pretty impressive quarter. So Paul, you guys have had really strong cash flow here. And not to be too much of a cheerleader but it is a differentiated experience on your carrier. So I guess, is there any positive momentum here in CapEx, where you'd say, hey actually we want to spend a little bit more? Does it reprioritize fleet over the airport trends over technology or maybe strategic? Or do you want to stay with this very balanced capital allocation strategy? Paul Jacobson : Well, first of all thank you for the comments Brandon. I think the balanced approach has worked very, very well for us in an effort to balance multiple constituencies, whether it's cash flow performance into the enterprise but driving return on invested capital. We obviously have a lot of demands on capital when you look across the space and the things that we want to do. Prioritization and pace of implementation is an important piece of that. It's not always just capital. It's having the resources to deploy that capital and make sure that it's delivering the benefits and the results. So while I'd say we do have \u2013 we do have some room around the edges, you've seen us do that over time, take advantage of opportunities that are out there. We want to hold roughly to that balanced allocation over time. Ed Bastian : Brandon, I could weigh in also it's Ed. I'd say, if there was any area that we'd look if we had opportunities to accelerate somewhat, it's in the airport infrastructure and construction. We're in the midst of a very significant buildout. And clearly the sooner we can get that done the better. So not suggesting that we're going to change any CapEx assumptions but to the extent we had any capital that was available to be allocated that would be one place I look for using it. Brandon Oglenski : Okay, everyone. Thank you. Operator : And we'll hear next from Savi Syth of Raymond James. Savi Syth : Hey, Glen. Good morning, everybody. Glen I just wanted to ask a little bit more on the regional trends. At LATAM, you had a tougher comp versus 3Q but the performance is still pretty good. I'm just wondering as you, kind of, look forward, generally what are you seeing from a trend perspective? And is there any kind of region where we start to come on tough comp? Glen Hauenstein : So, we're seeing continued strength in the domestic U.S. arena. That's great news for us. And we're seeing I think some really good green shoots in the transatlantic. We've had currency issues over the last couple of years since 2018. And now that we're going to be lapping them as we move through this year, I think we're poised really well for a nice run in the transatlantic. We've seen in the trans-Pacific after a multiyear restructuring that this is the last piece and there's some uncertainty maybe around the airport moves that we are going to have. Those are two major airport moves for us closing Tokyo and Narita after being there for almost 50 years. That's a big move. And so uncertainty over how many people will prefer Haneda. But I think ultimately we are very, very confident that Haneda is a better airport to serve Tokyo than Narita. And so there may be some ripples there that it would be unique to us as we have the largest footprint in Haneda. And then, of course, moving to Daxing and Beijing might be a little bit of a headwind for a short period of time. But again we think that's the right move for us because the connectivity at that airport is going to be far superior in the long run towards our capital. So the Pacific I think we're encouraged at the signs. Today's signing or the signing of the agreement phase one agreement with China is going to be a good thing for us. And if there is an upside to the Chinese, there's been really no capacity to bring capacity reductions in the U.S. to China for the first time in years. So traffic continues to build into China and capacity is being reduced. So that's always a good thing for the airline industry. And then in LATAM, we've seen really good strength in both Mexico and Brazil and we expect that to continue and then accelerate as we can begin to code with LATAM throughout the year. So I think we've got a really good base for international, which is encouraging. And the sequential trends and the improvements are all moving in the right direction for us. Savi Syth : That's very helpful. Thank you. And Paul if I could quickly ask just on trainer, generally what you're expecting especially now that IMO 2020 has come and gone. And just some quick thoughts on what your expectations are for Trainer and steel in general? Paul Jacobson : Sure Savi. So 2019 saw Trainer produced a profit at $75 million free cash flow positive and really a strong contribution to our overall relative fuel story. In 2020, obviously, we've seen at least where we sit today significant improvement in crack spreads at the refinery over last year. We expect about breakeven performance compared to about a $35 million loss last year. So we're looking forward to another sizable contribution overall both in terms of the performance of the refinery as well as the contribution across the commercial space and our fuel procurement. Savi Syth : Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Myles Walton of UBS. Myles Walton : Thanks. Good morning. A lot has changed in the month since the Analyst Day on the Max continued push out there, shut down the line likely a slower delivery rates. So I'm curious as you look at your place in the ecosystem, are you taking a lot of active decisions to capture some of that? Or is this more of a view to benefit through pretty much passive behavior let it come to you? I'm just curious, how much active management you're thinking about versus simply having the premium revenue come your way? Thanks. Ed Bastian : Myles this is Ed. We've all been watching the MAX story for the last year and none of us have a very good crystal ball. We're operating our plan. We're not deviating on the plan based on news flow. We have a strong plan for 2020. And to the extent we pick up some marginal revenue which we clearly have this year that's great. Again, I would caution everyone I would not suggest that's premium revenues that we're picking up because I think the other airlines have done a very nice job of covering their most important revenue pools. But on the margin, we've clearly been a beneficiary and as long as the MAX stays out of the sky, I guess, we'll continue to be one. Myles Walton : And a follow-up on the MRO benefit you might get from further aftermarket work running hot what's the growth rate? I know you said deceleration what's the growth rate you've got baked in for 2020? Ed Bastian : Growth rate in 2020? Myles Walton : Yes. Ed Bastian : I don't think we disclosed that. What we've talked about really as longer term. There is some growth but the big growth story in the MRO is a couple of years out. And for gear turbofan platform and the roles platforms start to enter more service and start to mature that's where we do expect the MRO revenues to double over the next two to three years from today's level. Myles Walton : Okay, thank you. Jill Greer : Shannon, we're going to have time for one more question from the analyst community. Operator : Certainly. We'll take our final question from Stephen Trent with Citi. Stephen Trent : Good morning everybody and thanks very much for taking my time. Just first you mentioned your Amex credit card growth through 2023. To what degree should the revenue growth be driven by the new brands you're introducing? Glen Hauenstein : We don't disclose the makeup of the construction of the increases. But what we have said is that we expect it to grow from $4.1 billion this year to $7 billion by 2023. And we have a very good component plan. I think we outlined the three pieces that include card spend growth, that included new acquisitions, and any changes in the core contract. And those three make up those components. Stephen Trent : Okay, very helpful. And just one quick follow-up as a follow-up to Mike Linenberg's question away back. When you think about LATAM airlines, are there any things that you see in the business that perhaps at this very early stage are a little stronger than you expected or maybe a little bit more challenging than you expected? I appreciate you might not be able to give us much color, but I just thought I'd ask. Glen Hauenstein : No, these are the very early days and we are very, very excited about that partnership and we think it's going to have great long-term benefits. We can only see a little bit as the relationship is just starting and we're just starting to put some of the key components in place with interline agreements. But what we have seen has exceeded our expectations in the early days and we're very optimistic that this is going to be a game changer for us in Latin America. Ed Bastian : If I could echo Glen's comments we're very impressed with the leadership team at LATAM. Cuetos, Roberto, the entire team is a first-class group. I think we're going to find as we start to build out the JV with the appropriate regulatory approvals you're going to see this spool up faster than probably any of our other JVs. There's really good alignment. There's focus and there's a lot of growth opportunity for both carriers throughout the Americas. So we're very, very pleased. Stephen Trent : Okay. Thanks very helpful. I\u2019ll leave it there. And thank you again. Ed Bastian : Thank you. Jill Greer : That's going to wrap-up the analyst portion of the call. And I will now turn it over to Tim Mapes, our Chief Marketing and Communications Officer. Tim Mapes : So we have a few more minutes with the team, I'd reiterate Jill's comments earlier to please just hold your questions to one maybe a short brief follow-up then we'll try to get through as many of these as we can. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Leslie Josephs of CNBC. Leslie Josephs : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. On the investments on tech, do you guys see Delta becoming sort of a travel platform like for corporate travelers sort of like an AmEx or a Concur something like that? And then my second question, if you just have any update on what's going on with the pilots and mediation. Thank you. Ed Bastian : Leslie on your first question we absolutely do see ourselves as becoming an extended travel platform. We're not going to be looking to get in the TMC space or compete with outfits like Concur. But what we are doing is from a consumer standpoint, looking to continue to extend the brand using the Fly Delta app as more of a digital concierge bringing partners such as Lyft closer into the application, so making it easier for our customers to have an end-to-end experience through travel on the Delta app and all the way through hotel partners and other \u2013 other ways by which we can take stress out of the consumers experience. That was the message at CES, and I think it was received well and that's where we're going. We're not going to comment on pilot negotiations. So I'll pass on your second question. Leslie Josephs : Okay. And just on the apps that's more for individual consumers not corporate platforms \u2013 corporation rather? Ed Bastian : This is very much focused on individual consumers. There is clearly some corporate benefits, but right now we're really focused on serving all customers. Leslie Josephs : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Mary Schlangenstein of Bloomberg News. Mary Schlangenstein : Hi. I just wanted to try again on the pilots. Would you at least confirm whether or not you're seeking intervention by the National Mediation Board in the negotiations? Ed Bastian : We are not going to comment on the state of any negotiations with the pilots on any questions. Sorry, Mary. Mary Schlangenstein : Okay. Thank you. Ed Bastian : We think just to clarify. We think it's not appropriate to be talking publicly about it. It's a \u2013 obviously it's a great opportunity for us and our Delta pilots to work together to make sure that they're best compensated and rewarded for what they do. Operator : And our next question will come from Ted Reed of Forbes. Ted Reed : Thank you. My question is for Glen. I imagine that the 10% coastal growth in hubs, includes Boston and I'd like to know, if you anticipated that American would star to grow so fast in Boston they're growing very rapidly there and they added three new routes this morning. Glen Hauenstein : Yeah. I think we've had an incredible success in Boston and Boston, customers are choosing us at \u2013 as a matter of fact the third quarter data from the government just came out and we were in a virtual dead heat with Jet Blue as the largest revenue carrier in Boston. So I think we've made great progress and I think customers will stick with us. And so we'll see who ultimately are the winners and losers in Boston. But I know we'll be a winner. Ted Reed : Do you anticipate that American might start to grow there? Glen Hauenstein : I don't know what anybody else is going to do. And so this is a very competitive industry and people grow and shrink. And I think that in the long term the better products what we've consistently said what is as long as we think we can provide the best products and services we're ultimately going to win. Ted Reed : All right. Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from David Slotnick of Business Insider. David Slotnick : Hey, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering if you're starting to think about the 757 replacement. Are you waiting on Boeing's offering for the NMA? Or are you starting to consider the 321 XLR? Ed Bastian : David, we have spoken many times on that topic. We are looking at the NMA. Certainly we're looking at Airbus offerings. We're not close to any decisions on that yet. David Slotnick : Okay. Do you have a timeline or anything that you're anticipating having to replace those planes? Ed Bastian : We have not commented on timelines even. David Slotnick : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : And we'll hear next from Robert Silk of Travel Weekly. Robert Silk : Yes. So Ed you spoke a lot. At CES you put out a lot of technology, really exciting stuff. But I wanted to ask about maybe some of the things that aren't quite as exciting. For example, can you update me on your -- what -- how you're coming in distribution technology improvement? Also any improvements to just your core system Atlanta and also your PSS? Ed Bastian : I'm sorry. Your question broke up. Could you simplify maybe. You had a lot in there. We had a hard time hearing? Robert Silk : Yes, can you hear me now? Ed Bastian : Yes. Robert Silk : Your distributions technology PSS and also just improvements to the core \u2013 your core systems, how much are you investing in that? And how is that coming along? Ed Bastian : Well, clearly we've been investing a significant amount of money on trying to continue to improve the digital experience and the distribution system and giving customers more choices and more ways to interact with us more optionality. We have continued to release the new updates of delta.com. And I believe we are now at 7 million downloads just this past year on the app. So we continue to evolve in that space and we continue to work with all of our partners and continue to work on making sure that the distribution systems are capable of describing the products that we're trying to sell to our customers, which really can't be done any longer in green screens. So that's been a continual evolution and we've been working with all the partners the GDS's and all the distributors of our products and services to try and highlight what the differentiated products are that we're bringing to market. Robert Silk : Okay. Thanks. And anything else related to the core systems or the \u2013 or PSS improvement? Ed Bastian : We can. Could you repeat that? Had a hard time hearing you. Robert Silk : I'm sorry. Anything else related to any additional improvements with the PSS or the core systems? Rahul Samant : Well, I think \u2013 this is Rahul Samant. I'm the CIO here. And we do, I mean that is our core engine the PSS Deltamatic, which we own. We have an advantage because we own it. We control the entire experience. And to Glen's point, it allows us then to do better with the customer experience and channel improvement because we own the end-to-end technology. Robert Silk : Okay. Thank you all. Tim Mapes : Yes. We have time for one final question. Operator : And our final question will come from Dan Reed of Forbes.com. Dan Reed : Glen, you guys obviously are gaining share in the above average yield the premium segment. Where can we look to see data that actually shows competitive data or competitive metrics where you guys are gaining the premium share? It's hard to put a finger on that number. Glen Hauenstein : Well, there's a lot of data points out there. There's no shortage of data in this industry. Most recently the U.S. government data came out for the third quarter. That's always about 180 days in arrears here or 90 days in arrears. So we did really well. And I think you could look at that. You could look at GDS's, you could look at corporate shares. So there's plenty of data. And if you'd like we could have somebody follow up as you run places you can go find that. Dan Reed : Please. But what is it? Is it just -- you're selling quality is the government -- the premium share gain? Glen Hauenstein : I think the Delta brand is really about providing the best quality airline service in the world and we continue to emphasize that and focus on that. And we have 80,000 of the world's best people delivering it every day. Dan Reed : Okay. Thank you. Tim Mapes : With that, I will wrap up this call. Thank you, operator. Just to remind everybody we'll see and look forward to being with everyone on the next call on April 9th. Thank you again for your time today. Operator : And that does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you all for your participation.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jill Greer : Thanks. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. We have a small team here in the room today including our CEO, Ed Bastian. Our President, Glen Hauenstein and our CFO Paul Jacobson. The rest of our leadership team is on the line for the Q&A. The call today will focus on our response to COVID-19 with Ed giving an overview of our priorities and Paul giving an expense and liquidity update. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A. Please limit yourself to one question in every follow up. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures and you can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com and with that I'll turn the call over to Ed. Ed Bastian : Thanks Jill. Good morning everyone. We appreciate you taking time to join us today. The first quarter of 2020 has truly been like no other in our history. The hearts and prayers of the entire Delta family are with the thousands worldwide who have lost loved ones to this pandemic. None of us could possibly have anticipated the speed with which COVID-19 has affected the health of the world's people and slowed economies across the globe. This has led to an unprecedented situation where demand for near-term air travel dropped to almost zero in a matter of weeks. Our response has been focused on three priorities; first, protecting the health and the safety of our employees and our customers. Second, preserving our financial liquidity to work through this crisis and third, ensuring we're well positioned to recover once the virus is contained and building a plan to accelerate our progress through this period of recovery. Nothing is more important than the health and the safety of our people and our customers and we have substantially increased our investment in cleanliness across the organization. These include a wide range of safety and cleaning measures on our planes, at the airports and across our facilities. And these actions won't end when the virus abates. We're taking steps to help our employees and customers practice social distancing. They include blocking middle seats, pausing automatic upgrades, modifying our boarding process and reducing meal service and other touch points. I've always said we have the best team in the industry. I want to thank all 90,000 of them for the incredible work that they are doing. Our employees are on the frontlines in the fight against the virus keeping our nation's airways open for essential travel even as they worry about their own health. Our nation has a lot of heroes in this battle against the virus and I'm proud of the men and women of Delta serving our nation in this time of need. The CARES Act Payroll Support Program recognizes the important role our employees to play in supporting the U.S. economy and we are grateful to the President, members of Congress and the administration and particularly secretary Mnuchin for their support and their leadership. On Monday, we received $2.7 billion of the $5.4 billion that's expected over the next few months. $3.8 billion of this is direct aid with $1.6 billion in a low-interest unsecured 10-year loan. When you combine this relief with our actions in the capital markets and our aggressive cost management, we expect to have at least $10 billion in liquidity at the end of the June quarter. Since early March, we've raised $5.4 billion in new financing and will likely raise several billion more this quarter. A strong indication of the confidence that the capital markets have in Delta. And while this will help ensure we have liquidity to weather the crisis with a more than 90% expected reduction in revenue this quarter we needed to quickly address costs to stem cash burn. We have taken actions to reduce our total cost base by over 50% in the June quarter. This amounts to $5 billion reduction over the prior year, which is impressive given the very short timeframe with which we had to get this done. And it was the great spirit of the Delta people that were a big part of making that happen. Right now 37,000 employees more than one third of our workforce have elected to take voluntary unpaid leaves ranging from 30 days to one year; a significant personal sacrifice that I will forever be grateful for. This is helping reduce our daily cash burn which started at $100 million per day in March down to $50 million a day starting next month in May. Paul will go into more detail on these cost reductions and the cash burn trajectory that we are seeing. After taking care of the safety of our customers and our people and protecting the financial liquidity of our enterprise, the third priority we have is starting to build our recovery plan. These are truly unprecedented times and the path to recovery is uncertain and will likely be choppy and while we all wish we could predict the pace of the recovery, the truth is our recovery will be dictated by our customers feeling safe both physically and financially to begin to travel at scale. Given the combined effects of the pandemic and associated financial impact on the global economy, we believe that it could be up to three years before we see a sustainable recovery and to succeed throughout that environment we will likely need to resize our business in the near term to protect it in the long term. And while the resizing business over the short term is painful it will also be an opportunity to accelerate strategies to streamline our company, simplify our fleet and reduce our fixed cost base in ways not possible in the past. It will allow us to advance the timelines as some of our critical airport infrastructure projects as we don't have the same constraints that limited progress and drove higher cost to construct. We will be focused on what it takes to regain consumer confidence to travel and we are enlisting the very best medical advisors to help us navigate the journey from testing through to vaccines and helping translate those solutions to our business model. Safety will no longer be limited to flight safety but personal safety as well. And while we may have more questions than answers about our path forward at present one thing that is certain it is that the strengths that are core to Delta's business our people, our brand, our network and our operational reliability are enduring. These advantages will continue to differentiate Delta and position us to succeed. In short, we have the same aspirations for our company today that we had a short 60 days ago and while the path to recovery may take several years there are many aspects to this crisis that will make us a better, stronger and more resilient airline. In fact, I believe that the customer of tomorrow will place a higher premium on the quality of service than ever before and that is our calling card, the strength of our brand, our reliability and the service excellence of our people redefining personal safety for our customers and serving as the bedrock not just for our recovery but our acceleration into the future. So that is how we're navigating this crisis, taking the very best care of our customers and our people, preserving the financial liquidity of the enterprise and building a plan to not just rescale the business over the recovery period but to streamline it and accelerate progress on our long-term strategy. I would like to thank all of our employees, our partners, our community and government leaders, our suppliers, our banks, our owners everyone who is helping to contribute to protect Delta's long-term success. Our customers continue to send thousands of strong messages of support on a daily basis which I greatly appreciate and I'd also appreciate the great work of our leadership team in navigating a core in which we know we will prevail. Thank you all for that. And before I turn the call over to Paul, I have some good news that I hope you have all heard. As you know Paul had announced his plans to retire on February 28 but he never left the office and I personally asked him to reconsider and he's graciously agreed. Paul is an incredibly important part of our team and we're fortunate that he will remain as Delta CFO. Paul? Paul Jacobson : Thank you Ed and good morning everybody. Thank you all for joining us. It is great to be here and thank you for that Ed. Our March quarter pre-tax loss of $422 million, $1.3 billion lower than last year was Delta's first quarterly loss in almost decade. As revenues rapidly deteriorated through the month of March we took decisive action to reduce our cost base and preserve liquidity ending the quarter with $6 billion in cash. Our ability to move the needle on costs in the month of March was limited as schedules and bid periods were largely set. Starting this month however, our cost structure has taken a big step down with the adjustments we have made. These actions include strategically parking more than 650 aircrafts to get optimal maintenance savings and reducing our facilities expense by consolidating concourses and temporarily closing Sky Clubs. We've eliminated the majority of our discretionary spend for things like contractors and advertising as well. We also instituted a hiring freeze and reduced work hours across the business and as Ed mentioned 37,000 of our employees have volunteered to take an unpaid leave of absence. Together these actions result in savings of approximately $550 million in the June quarter alone. With such a large capacity pull down we needed to go beyond what we normally would consider volume related costs. Because of our aggressive cost management we were able to swiftly make 60% of our total operating expenses variable in this environment. These efforts have offset more than $200 million of unplanned expenditures associated with new cleaning procedures and the recent debt raises that we've accomplished. Combined with $2 billion in lower fuel expense from reduced flying and lower fuel prices we expect a $5 billion reduction in total operating expense for the June quarter. Our ability to achieve these savings simply would not be possible without the dedication, spirit and commitment of the Delta people. With the immediate needs of the June quarter addressed, we're now beginning to think about how we reset the cost structure of the company for the longer term. Glen and his team are developing scenario views of what the revenue environment might look like for the next several years. This will underpin not only how our network should adapt but how our cost structure will need to as well. In the current environment, we can take a fresh zero-based look at our cost structure. Especially where we spend money on overhead like facilities, advertising and third-party contract providers. And as Ed mentioned accelerating work on initiatives like fleet simplification will have a lasting benefit to our cost structure going forward because ultimately cost reductions are the biggest lever to mitigate cash burn in an uncertain revenue environment. At the end of March a cash burn was running approximately $100 million per day. You can think of this in two parts; roughly $10 million to $20 million in negative net sales as refunds outpaced bookings and the difference in expense burn. As we move through the June quarter we expect net sales to remain slightly negative as we work down our refund backlog and take additional capacity actions. When closed in demand returns cash will recover as corporate customers purchase new tickets and leisure travelers are utilizing their travel credits over a multi-year period. In addition to our work on expenses we've had good success negotiating deferred payments to airports, vendors and lessors. During this time we've also moved quickly to reduce capital outflows cutting more than $3 billion of our planned 2020 CapEx, suspending all shareholder returns and deferring elective voluntary pension funding. Putting this together, we expect cash burn should come down to $50 million per day beginning in May, a 50% reduction from where we were just a few short weeks ago. That moderation should continue in the back half of the year as revenue recovers modestly but we are prepared for cash flow to remain negative through the end of the year. To make it through this period we have been actively and aggressively raising liquidity. The work we put into the balance sheet over the last decade has made a tremendous difference as we went into this crisis with more than $20 billion in unencumbered assets and low debt levels. Since early March, we've raised $5.4 billion of new financing at an average rate of just under 4% encumbering approximately $6.5 billion of collateral. For the remainder of the year we have an exhaustive list of potential initiatives that we could action if needed to further bolster liquidity. Among other things this list includes raising additional debt against our remaining unencumbered assets. We are also eligible for a $4.6 billion secured loan under the CARES Act. While we plan to apply for that loan later this month to reserve our place we have several months to determine if we will take those funds and accept the loan. In closing, Delta has experienced shocks before perhaps not this big but in many ways we spent the last decade preparing for this next disruption. Our people have acted quickly and decisively to protect the financial health of the organization and I'm proud of what the team has accomplished in just a short period of time. This environment remains fluid and anything but predictable. But we will continue to plan for every eventuality and are committed to taking the steps necessary to ensure that Delta is positioned to help lead the industry and the economy out of this crisis. And with that I'll turn the call back over to Jill to begin the Q&A. Jill Greer : Thanks Paul. Lauren if you could give the analysts the instructions to get into the call queue. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Andrew Didora : Hi. Good morning everyone. Can you hear me okay? Ed Bastian : We can. Paul Jacobson : Good morning Andrew. Andrew Didora : Great. Thank you for the time. Ed or Paul, Paul you gave a little bit of color around this but can you maybe, provide a bit more granularity on how you get from $100 million of cash burn at the end of March as $50 million run rates kind of in the back half of the second quarter? What's the biggest drivers here? Is it CapEx? What are some of your assumptions around the air traffic liability, draw down, any opportunities at the refinery, etc? So any color here would be helpful. Paul Jacobson : Sure. Thanks. First of all thanks Andrew for being here and for your question. It really is the across the board effort, across the expense base obviously certain volume based costs like passenger commissions, passenger service items have come down commensurate with the loss of travel demand. We've seen 80% to 90% reductions in some of those line items. We mentioned briefly in early march that we were taking actions across our maintenance program and Jill and our technical operations team has done an amazing job of stripping out over 80% of our maintenance costs in the June quarter year-over-year. That's largely as a function of the fact that the performing fleet today doesn't need nearly as much inventory of serviceable parts and components that we had planned. So we've been able to shift our focus to those critical items reducing over 80% from that. We mentioned all the salaries and related across-the-board that has been a collective effort coming forward. The suspension of CapEx, obviously a big piece of that, we had done a good bit of that even in the second half of March but really it's across the operational side that's driving a lot of that incremental benefit. Ed Bastian : The other thing Andrew is all the leaves, over 30,000 employees have taken voluntary leaves many of them in April, the current month were in on an unpaid basis and are extending those throughout not just the quarter but some into the full year and those are monumental and they're really helpful. Andrew Didora : Got it. Thank you for that. And then just second question here maybe Ed, a bigger picture question here for you on your fleets given some of your comments on what you see kind of a whole long recovery process here? So when you look at the other side of this crisis what do you think will be the biggest changes for the Delta fleet? Do you think it will be a little bit more weighted towards newer aircraft with varying economics and how are you thinking about that and especially as you speak with the OEMs right now? Thank you. Ed Bastian : Well, certainly anything that was scheduled to retire over the next five years as an accelerated path towards retirement just to be very-very simple and straightforward. If the MD 80s were already retiring this year so that's on the MD 90s. We'll probably be making that decision soon in a similar vein. We got 767, 757 there's some of the older models that we operate. We will certainly be looking at the a RJ's with smaller RJ's that we operate. But we'll be taking the time to, as they say accelerate into the future and fast-forwarding many of these decisions with simplification and streamlining of our entire business model at the core of the new normal for Delta. Many of things that we're on a path to do. I think we shorten that pathway considerably as a result of this crisis. Andrew Didora : Great. Thank you for that. Ed Bastian : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Jamie Baker : Hey good morning everybody. Paul the best news of today is that you're with us on the call and we'll be going forward. I'm sure you're going to hear that from others but I did want to add my voice after Ed's comments. Now when you spoke at our conference a month ago, a month and a half whatever at that time it was $20 billion unencumbered asset pool. You said the recent deals drew that down by about $6.5 billion. Does that mean the current pool is $13.5 billion or have any of the underlying assets been revalued and as a clarification on that have you yet identified what collateral you might post as part of a government loan and whether a treasury could take equity in SkyMiles? Paul Jacobson : Well first of all Jamie, thank you for your kind comments. It's really good to be here too. The simple math is the right one, the way we're looking at it we have constantly updated the market values of the collateral and where we look. So yes, against what we just disclosed we've got about $13.5 billion that we continue to review and we have a list against those assets. So we're going to continue to move forward on raising liquidity, making sure that we shore up that balance sheet and keeping all options on the table. As for the government loan program we haven't had any specific conversations as I mentioned in my comments. We have worked out with them that we are going to apply for the grant, I'm sorry for the loan by April 30, but the provisions of that program give us until September 30 to decide whether we will actually action and structure and take that loan going forward. Jamie Baker : That helps. Sorry go ahead. Paul Jacobson : No, I was going to say no conversations about any specific collateral at this point in time. We have shared with them that we are committed as is the -- not just the language but the spirit of the program to access it if there are no reasonable capital markets opportunities available and we still feel pretty good about what's available to us in the market. Jamie Baker : Got it. And second question, you also made reference to aircraft CapEx essentially going down to zero. Looking to clarify that, does that mean that you're simply not sending any cash to Telus or you\u2019re saying that there's full financing already in place. To put differently if we do see an aircraft delivered this year should we assume that it is fully financed? Ed Bastian : Hi Jamie. It's Ed. Jamie Baker : Hi Ed. Ed Bastian : Hi. The situation with Airbus is one that obviously we've got a great relationship. We're having constructive dialogue but the reality is as I've shared with gentlemen and he shares our pain. We've got 600 aircrafts on the ground. We don't need any more aircraft to be putting on the ground and we'll work through this issue. We don't have any plans to expend cash to your point over the balance of this year on new aircraft, whether eventually over the course of the year we wind up taking some fully financed aircraft. It's an open question right now but the reality is is that they're, they're good partners and they're working with us on it. Jamie Baker : I appreciate it. Thank you both. Ed Bastian : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Michael Linenberg : Paul, glad you never left. So two questions here when we think about the Payroll Support Program and as you [indiscernible] how are you going to account for that? How does that run P&L? I understand that the loan fees will show up as interest expense. That'd be like an extraordinary item? Paul Jacobson : So Mike good morning. The grant peace net of the loan will actually flow through as a contra expense item essentially offsetting the requirements that are in there for maintaining workforce, etc. So it'll show up as an offset to salaries and related or other operating. We're still working through that but it will flow through the P&L. The loan piece of it will obviously be capitalized on the balance sheet as a debt instrument. Interest expense will flow through that and the warrant will be reflected as equity. Michael Linenberg : Okay then just to be clear then just the $100 million going to $50 million it's not reflecting that as an offset coming from the P&L later or at least impacting the cash? Paul Jacobson : No. It's in all the cash numbers that we've talked about in terms of ending above $10 billion in June. Michael Linenberg : Great. [indiscernible]. Michael Linenberg : Great. And then just secondly as we think about the Amex program. We were at a number around 4.5 on its way to call it 7 billion as we think about the components, rate doesn't change, it will probably be down in 2020 and maybe acquisition doesn't grow much or moderates is that a fair way to think about the trajectory in 2020? Paul Jacobson : I think so Mike. I know Amex has their call later in the week on earnings and they'll probably discuss how they're doing, how they're referring to the crisis. Clearly given the fact that passenger demand is falling also dramatically, our carts think has not fallen off nearly as dramatically but it's down in numbers in the short term and it's one of the things that's enabling us to keep, we got 10% revenue target in the current quarter compared to our current plan. That's one of the contributing factors is the spend on the card. Michael Linenberg : Okay. Very good. Thank you. Ed Bastian : Mike, I think when Amex talks on Friday, I think you will probably have some better, I don't want to I am close to Steve and I know the numbers. I don't want to share anything but I think when you hear their perspective it will better answer your questions than I can. Michael Linenberg : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi Syth : Hey good morning. I wonder if you could help me as abridge the liquidity kind of getting from $6 billion to $10 billion? It appears the cash spend will be around $5.5 billion in quarter, you have the -- kind of maybe most or all of those $5.4 billion in TSP, and I think based on the disclosure you have the sale leaseback of one to two and there's kind of aircraft mortgages and perhaps some term loans there and I think that leaves a gap about $2 billion to $2.5 billion. Is that financing that you need yet to do to reach that 10 billion or am I missing something there? Paul Jacobson : Savi, it's Paul. I would simply say that you're good at math. That works pretty well. Savi Syth : I guess that math degree works out well for me. Paul Jacobson : You are using it well. Savi Syth : Just a follow up on that. As you think about your financing opportunities, I know you talked about having unencumbered assets but you think about like unencumbered assets, miles, equity or maybe even like doing something with trainer. How would you prioritize that? Or is it kind of see kind of the best fit for kind of financing going forward? Paul Jacobson : Well Savi, I think we have as I mentioned in exhaustive list of potential opportunities that range across the board including secured debt, equity convertible, the government loan program SkyMiles lots of different things on it. What I would say is that, we're looking to optimize two things. Number one which is availability and an ease of financing and two is just availability of the markets in general. We have found great success in both the secured debt markets as well as the sale-leaseback markets that have done particularly well for us and we would certainly put that at a higher priority than we would be thinking about equity down the road. So well, the uncertainty means that we can't rule anything out we're certainly prioritizing use of our unencumbered assets. Ed Bastian : And I would share Savi, I would share Paul's thoughts on the financing prioritization but don't forget the most important liquidity we raised is it\u2019s cost savings, in this environment where revenue wasn't coming in the door and while it's great that we have access to the capital markets. My team is doing a very good job. The fact that we're able to save 50% of our total operating costs that we had in our forecast just 30 days ago in the current quarter that's $5 billion as well. So that's a meaningful statement of liquidity that will obviously continue to build off of. Savi Syth : Very good point. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Brandon Oglenski : Good morning everyone and thanks for taking my question. So I guess just to follow up on that, in terms of equity funding, I guess one up maybe potentially be a bit more aggressive here because if you need the equity financing in the future obviously that's not guaranteed to be there. Can you give us your thoughts there? Ed Bastian : Brandon, you weren't real clear. Was your question about a potential equity raise? Is that what you're asking us? Brandon Oglenski : Sorry my phone's cutting out Ed. The question is if you need equity financing in the future it could be harder to get, so I guess why not potentially be more aggressive on that part of the balance sheet right now? Ed Bastian : Yes. Well we're not in a position to take any options off the table. We're looking at, at all options. We have no plan for that at the moment. We've got a pretty good list of opportunities to raise liquidity from before executing that option but we're not going to exclude any option going forward until we have a better view when the recovery is going to come. Brandon Oglenski : Okay. Appreciate that and then Paul, on the unencumbered assets I think around $13 billion or $14 billion you disclosed, how much of that is aircraft and what should investors expect you could get LTVs on that asset base? Paul Jacobson : Well, Brandon it varies. I would say that about half of that is aircraft of various ages and vintages. Some of the newer airplanes that we have been doing sale leasebacks on, we've been getting a 100% sometimes even marginally a little bit more than what we had appraised for on that basis. Some of the older airplanes as we are looking at that are going to have let's say leaseback content more secure debt type content that would have a lower loan-to-value going forward. So it really varies across the pool but we've taken that pool. We've assigned value to what we think is doable and we're marching along that plan. Brandon Oglenski : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein. David Vernon : Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the time. First question for you on the approach towards taking gross holdings and global partners obviously there's going to be quite a few markdown to those assets as we go through the next couple of months here. Would you think about that asset as a potential source of liquidity on the way back up or would you continue to think that those investments are kind of strategic and core to the Delta in the future as well? Ed Bastian : David again you broke up a bit on the phone. Your question is about our investments in our international partners using that to raise our cash, monetizing them. David Vernon : Yes, well on the way back up yes. I'm just wondering if you may be thinking about that strategy across differently. Ed Bastian : Those are all strategic partnerships and they'll all go through and they are all going through a very similar situation is that they arguably even more stressed than the domestic U.S. airlines are given that the international business across the board is pretty much down to very-very small numbers. We are in constant contact with them. We'll continue to provide our insight, our expertise. We're not in the position to be making any financial commitments to any of them and they are aware of that and we will work with them as the recovery takes hold. This recovery is going to be choppy. It's going to take some time. My expectation, I think our expectation is domestic will come back faster than international but international will come back and there's a path to getting there and we're very proud of those partnerships and I have no interest in trying to sell them or monetizing them at this point or any time in the future candidly. David Vernon : All right. Appreciate that color and then maybe a longer term question for Glen or Ed maybe you could comment on how investors should be thinking about the range of reasonable margins assuming demand it does take a couple of years to recover? Should we be expecting the margin profile of the business to be dependent on getting back to 2019 levels or would you expect to be able to maybe come out of this at a better margin level with less volume than you had in the past? Glen Hauenstein : Hey, so that's a really open-ended speculative question. How I'm looking at this from myself and we're all of 40 days into this right, is that there is a big, there's a crisis that we're in the midst of we're going to need to navigate the crisis. We're prepared at Delta to go through for whatever time it takes. We've got the liquidity. We've got the balance sheet strength. We've got the resiliency of our people in our brand. We'll get through this. It may take, take several years to get to it but we will get through it. But once we're able to demonstrate to our customers\u2019 confidence and the safety of air travel, just like we do today and play safety there's a personal safety, travel will continue. It may not continue in all of its current form. There will be some impact maybe telecommuting or some sort of things if everyone's enjoying being on Zoom videos, I personally don't but maybe some people do, maybe that'll change the nature of travel a bit but business is done face-to-face. People enjoy experiences. All the things we've seen over the last year period of years actually has, in my opinion caused people to miss travel more than ever before in this lockdown phase and we'll get back whether it means our margins are going to be at the same level. I would hope so. That's certainly going to be our goal and we'll be a smaller industry coming through this. I have no doubt and that there will be opportunities to be streamlined and I think people will pay a premium for service excellence like never before. Those are my views in the question. David Vernon : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : Ed, that's so funny you just said that I was literally going to ask you about that comment you made. In the prepared remarks you said a customer of tomorrow will place a higher premium on quality of service. You seem to emphasize that in the script and I want to know what you mean by that and how are you going to position Delta to capitalize on it from a product perspectives? Ed Bastian : Well, I think it's premature to be speculating on product per se Hunter, but I firmly agree to believe that even when you ask people what's the most important thing to get them to start traveling and it's going to be confidence in their safety, their personal safety not just their physical safety and we are, at Delta we have years and years and years of expertise in flight safety expertise and we've got rigor and analytical tools. We are the safest form of transportation in the world of any form of transportation in the U.S. aviation system. And by applying that same level of analytical rigor and insight working with the medical community and I'm not trying to be a healthcare professional here but we do have medical expertise and advisers that we are working with and will continue to work with the help translate the return of business to where people feel safe and an accommodate that. We will make whatever changes to the business model that will be necessary. If it turns out to be immunity passports will be a new form, you think about everything that came out of 9/11 with TSA and homeland security and new public agencies. Could there be a new public health agency coming out that requires a new passport to travel and I don't know but we'll be on the forefront of all those advances but I do believe people will value not just the experience but who's providing the experience and the reliability and the service excellence of that and that's our calling card, that's our brand. That's what Delta stands for. Hunter Keay : Right. That's all fair, but yes I mean you were kind of there before too. So what I'm trying to parse out is what you expect to actually change; is one of those things it's ironic I actually about lower load factors three months ago on this call, is one of these things that maybe you think about running a lower load factor sort of permanently and having less variability in pricing. So maybe it's a 65%- 75% load factor you guys run all the time so people feel a bit more spaced out or the seats themselves are further apart. I mean like what kind of stuff are you talking about changing here that's different. Ed Bastian : I think all those are fair observations Hunter. I don't know what the answer is. We're going to spend the time in these next few months to as we build the company that we want for the future not necessarily rebuild what we had and we'll be asking ourselves to that question. We'll be asking consumers those questions. We will be, we will have a chance to test as we move forward, as we walk through. This recovery is going to take several years. It's going to be a multi-phase. It's going to be choppy along the way. We'll have opportunities to test all those species and see what it takes. Ultimately, it's going to be what it take to inspire confidence in air travel and the safety of that maybe it's vaccine in two years on a widespread. I don't know but there's a host of ideas and options and alternatives that we are exploring and we'll do whatever it takes to make sure that we get our business model not to back to where it was but improved and more resilient for the future. Our margins whether our low factors come down or not it's possible. They certainly will be in the short to medium term. Whether they eventually get back to 90% who knows but we'll figure it out as we go. The other thing I do know is that there will be fewer airplanes flying in the skies for an extended period of time and that's going to be an opportunity for us to focus more on a more premium experience and getting paid for what we deliver. Hunter Keay : Ed, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey thanks and thank you for doing this call. I just had a question on your international JV partners. What are the potential capital needs to keep some of them going if they are unable to get stimulus funding? Ed Bastian : Well, I think all of our international partners are working with their local governments as to what's required to provide backstop and support similar to how we work with our government here in the U.S. I'd say the thing that's a little different in most of the international marketplace is that they're talking about loans as compared to grants and we were very successful and I give the U.S. airline aviation industry some real kudos for getting out in front of this working with A for A working with all the CEOs across our space to understand that this is not just about putting more debt on airlines balance sheets but keeping people in their jobs for a period of time to give us a chance to understand what the other side of this looks like in six months. I don't know that you'll see that on an international scale. I think there will be a lot of loans. You may see some international airlines nationalized. I think there's going to be an array of alternatives. You will see some international airlines go away. You will see some international airlines not on our specifically this is probably go through administrative and bankruptcy processes. So I think as we look at the trajectory of the recovery it's going to be slower internationally than domestically and as a result that we're going to stay really close to our partners and help provide them not the financial support but certainly the commercial support and the strategic savvy to navigate a very uncertain recovery. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thanks and then just for my follow-up had a couple of questions this morning on trainer. Interesting times with negative crude prices and is this something that you're in the process of winding down and to the extent you are, is there any potential working capital tailwind, if you were to wind trainer down and thanks for taking the questions. Paul Jacobson : Sure Duane and before I answer that I want to go back to one thing that David had asked and just to clarify for the avoidance of any doubt that the partner investments that he asked about monetizing that Ed said we're not interested, are not included in our unencumbered assets calculations just in case there was doubt about that. And as we think about trainer Duane obviously we've made some adjustments both in terms of where the market sit but also in terms of our own declines in jet fuel production, our jet fuel consumption which have been significant. We have cut production at trainer. We're operating about just a little over half of what we were and blending all that jet fuel into diesel and trainer is covering its variable costs and contributing to fixed costs in the short term. That being said we do expect it to produce a loss in the second quarter and as we think about trainer obviously we are thinking about what does the airline look like afterwards and we will assess all that. It remains an important part of our overall fuel strategy but that's obviously somewhat muted in the current environment today. Duane Pfennigwerth : Would there be a working capital tailwind if you were to kind of wind it down? Paul Jacobson : Nothing significant as we have a lot of that working capital already securitized and we managed to keep that relatively constant throughout all the operation. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen. Helane Becker : Thanks very much operator. Hi everybody. And thank you very much for the time. So here are my two questions. One is, do you think this will be a demand led recovery? How are you thinking about recovery in that regard? And second, Ed you talked a lot about what you can do once people get on your planes and certainly at the gate there's a lot you can do there's probably a lot you can do in the check-in process but what about in the airport? How are you working with your airport, your various airports about how you can ensure customer, I don't know what the right word is because it's not safety but I really don't know what word is. Ed Bastian : It is safety Helane. No, it is safety. It's personal hygiene. It's personal safety and the answer to your second question I'll take first is yes we are. We've got a lot of staff in the airport environment and not a lot of departures. So we've reallocated a lot of our team members to ensuring not just the cleanliness and the hygiene aboard our aircraft. You would probably not be surprised to know that as we continue to survey our customers even though we have fewer traveling we still continue to survey them that our cleanliness scores are through the ceiling, 3, 4X times improvements on board to planes and if you want to go check it out for yourself I'd encourage you to the travel on us. You can, you can see that. But working through the airport the facilities, working with TSA, all the things that we have to do to reduce touchpoints and allow customers the same level of safety on board to planes as they, they transit through our facilities. So we are looking through all of that. What will return through the recovery I don't know. I simply classified as a demand, I mean certainly I think demand will be there when it's safe to travel, when people feel confident that they feel through both the medical progress we make through the medical community, through government leadership when people indicate that it's safe to travel and that's when the recovery will take shape. This is very unlike anything we have ever encountered. We have encountered a lot of crisis in our industry. This one where people physically do not feel safe to venture out of their homes is unique to us and we got to inspire the confidence they have to start traveling again. Helane Becker : That's very helpful and if it helps I'm pretty sick of parades present. I love my house but I miss traveling. Ed Bastian : Good. We miss seeing you Helane. Helane Becker : Have a day. Thank you. Ed Bastian : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Joseph DeNardi : Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Just two straightforward questions for you Paul on the marketing company the loyalty program. Is there a scenario where you could do a pre-sale with Amex and use it as collateral for government money? And then what is the value of that asset worth as you see it? I think it's a pretty big moat that's protecting shareholders from dilution at this point. So can you just talk about what would you think the assets worth? Paul Jacobson : Joe, I think you've done a lot more work on that than we have necessarily but I would say that we have not contemplated securitizing it or monetizing it in any way and the asset base that we have and the permitted liens under our agreements, we think ultimately would make a pretty good package if we decided to take a government loans. So I don't think we need to look to loyalty for that. As for the opportunity to do a pre-sale up, not going to get into any details. That's obviously a conversation that we would have with American Express and Ed speaks to them very regularly and that's that's borne out of the partnership mentality. It's not anything that we would comment on here publicly. Ed Bastian : Joe. The only thing \u2013 Joseph DeNardi : Do you have to do an equity issuance or a pre-sale in order to qualify for the government that money? Ed Bastian : No. Joe. No, we don't. Yes, I just wanted to add on to what Paul was saying about Amex. They're great partners. We've been through thick and thin with them. We've done pre-sales in the past. If we come to the point where we feel that's an important source of liquidity, we will have good constructive conversations but we are not having conversations unlike publicly reported [documents] indicate we are not and but we're staying close to our good partners in that at some point we very well made but not, there's nothing imminent to announce it now. Joseph DeNardi : Okay. That's helpful and then I don't know if Glen is on the call or Ed, you'd like to talk about it. Can you just talk about demand. What sort of booking look like and what may be the mix of corporate versus user tells you at this point in terms of which is holding up, just any commentary you feel comfortable talking about. Thank you. Ed Bastian : Well, I categorize this with we're bumping along the bottom here and bookings are down. Traffic is down about 95% and that's where we're sitting and it's a mix of people who need to get there that's essential people traveling as I said before. So people who need to get to see sick people, people who are first responders, people whose work goes on and it's required for them to travel. So it's really people who are needing to travel and I think as it said before as people perceive it as being safer we will see the larger volumes come back but with everybody having stay at home orders, it's hard to envision when you can't leave your house, how you would go to travel at this point. Paul Jacobson : Yes. It\u2019s the demand questions are hard to answer because there's not a lot of data right now but one data point which is progress is that where cash sales are now starting to equal the refunds going out the door. So that wasn't the case, 30 days ago. We are being overwhelmed by the amount of cash refunds relative to the new cash sales coming in. So that's going to take some time. We're prepared for the duration and we know we've got a good product and good service and a good brand that will be there when people go set to travel. Joseph DeNardi : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Myles Walton with UBS. Myles Walton : [indiscernible] comments. First, on the government assistance for payroll protection beyond September 30, as you think about it is that something you think is necessary for the industry -- the industry would ask for? Ed Bastian : Additional government support beyond September 30 is that your question Myles? Myles Walton : It is. Yes. Ed Bastian : I wouldn't speculate. My sense is the appetite for additional relief beyond that will be challenging and I think the combination of the PSP together with the loans to provide us with liquidity we need to get through this crisis. That'd be my view. Myles Walton : Okay. And then secondarily kind of post crisis, I know you said it would take a few years but just a business model to run an airline, do you think that now airlines are effectively going to have to sit on six months of cash expenses in cash to satisfy whatever criteria there is to weather the next pandemic should have come along? Ed Bastian : I don't know. That would be a difficult financial burden to carry. I don't think we can build our business models to sustain once-in-a-century pandemics and we'll learn a lot from this. We will be a lot more resilient about this. This will take us a bit of time as an industry to dig out. They have got plenty of time to ask those questions in the future but for now we're very focused on weathering this storm and getting through over the next several years and then we'll have time to think about that. Myles Walton : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next comes from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Catherine O'Brien: Good morning everyone. Thanks for the time. I hope you all are safe and healthy. So two fairly quick ones. If you're not expecting any aircraft deliveries for the medium term or perhaps not even through the end of this year, is that $1.2 billion cash inflows in the sale-leaseback transaction you just closed today on aircraft already in your fleet? And then if so do you have any aircraft remaining in your fleet that might be attractive to put into a future sale-leaseback deals? Paul Jacobson : Good morning Katie. So the answer to your first question is absolutely those are all sale leasebacks on the existing fleet and I didn't catch the second question. Apologies. Catherine O'Brien: Sorry. I said are there any other remaining aircraft that would maybe be attractive to put into the future sell leaseback deals that are currently in your fleet? Paul Jacobson : Yes. We still have some as I mentioned in my earlier comments about half of the remaining is aircraft which includes some newer vintage models that we think are good candidates for sale leasebacks and some older aircrafts that at the end of the day probably are not that would be more in line for a secure deathbed transaction. But we still have some, yes. Catherine O'Brien: Okay. Got it. Appreciate that and then maybe just for my follow-up, the rate at which you've been able to get cost out of the system is impressive. Should we expect those cost savings to increase through year-end and potentially further lower that June Q exit rate cash burns or are there any items where you've been granted deferrals in the short term that maybe come back online towards year end? Thanks. Ed Bastian : Well, thanks Katie. We are going to do our best to continue with the programs we've got in place working through voluntary measures with our employees. They're doing a great job of taking leaves and reducing work hours and finding ways to preserve cash, our maintenance program we're doing the same thing. I think we'll have that same goal into Q3 certainly and hopefully Q4 and give us time to start building demand over the balance of the year to where the revenue can start to catch up with the level of cost savings that we're having and use that to reduce the cash burn but in the short term teams on a massive effort and I think you're going to see that continue. There\u2019s always been a lot of dialogue in our business as to what our true variable cost structure is. We're seeing that we've got a lot of variability that we've built into the cost structure and it's proving to be an important source of resiliency for us in our strategy here. Catherine O'Brien: Okay. Thanks. Appreciate that. Jill Greer : Hey Lauren, we are going to do one more question from the analysts. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Trent with Citi. Stephen Trent : Thank you very much everybody and appreciate you taking my question. Hope everybody and your families are okay. Quick ones from me. I was wondering if you could just give us a little color on how you might pivot a little to perhaps take opportunities more air cargo flow with passenger flow depressed at the moment? Ed Bastian : Thanks Stephen. I hope your family is well as well. We're doing that. We have a lot of work going on in the cargo space. We probably should have mentioned that during the call more. We've instituted charters going over to China as we're bringing medical supplies, PPE back to the workers on the front line of this crisis. We're working with a number of different companies to do that through. We have looked at and we're taking some of the main deck seats off our \u2013 a few of our international planes to facilitate taking greater lift in the short term and we'll continue to use those resources where it makes sense for certainly for some time to come. Team in cargo, Shawn Cole, is doing a really-really nice job and we've got a lot of people supporting in the broader community what we can do with relief efforts. Really proud. The other thing we've done, we didn't talk about is that we've repatriated over 5,000 people working with the State Department from markets that we don't even fly to historically or going into India and bringing tons of people back to their families safely and we continue to do some of those missions going forward. Stephen Trent : Very helpful and just one last follow-up actually a follow-up to the gentleman from Stifle\u2019s questions. When we think about the credit-card side of the business, longer term, it's fair to say that a lot of that consumer oriented card activity should continue to spool up in line with your expectations. Is that fair to say? Ed Bastian : Absolutely. Again there's nothing in this crisis that shows us any individual part of our business model. It doesn't work over time, but as long as people feel safe, everything's going to work. So spending will work, travel will work, experience will continue to be important and our partnership with American Express is incredibly strategic and important to us in the future. Stephen Trent : Thank you very much everybody and be safe. Ed Bastian : Thank you. You too. Paul Jacobson : Thanks Steve. Jill Greer : That's going to wrap the analyst portion of the call. We're actually having some technical difficulties on the call control. So I'm going to turn it over to our Chief Marketing and Communications Officer Tim Mapes to address the media. Tim Mapes : Well, I just wanted to thank everybody for your patience and your participation today. It's unfortunate that we're having this technical issue because Ed and the executive management team had actually asked for and expressed an interest in additional time to handle questions. So I think we will follow up with the varying members of my team to get these questions answered and get them into. We had 10 reporters queued up for this. So if you don't mind we'll follow up. Jill Greer : We will work to set up a separate call for that. Hold on just a minute. Tim Mapes : Again thank you for your patience. We are going to follow up, the members of my team will follow up with each of the reporters that we know were in the queue today. We will get varying ways of following up on your questions but I just wanted to thank you for your time and your participation today and know that we do know who was queued up and we will followup with each of you with different members of my team. So our apologies. Jill Greer : Thanks Lauren. Operator : Thank you and that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation today.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session, following the presentation. As a reminder today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jill Greer : Thanks, Cecilia. Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us for our June quarter earnings call. Speaking today on the call will be our CEO; Ed Bastian and our CFO; Paul Jacobson. We also have our President, Glen Hauenstein and our entire leadership team here with us for the Q&A. To get in as many questions as possible during the Q&A, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I'll turn it over to Ed. Ed Bastian : Thanks, Jill. Good morning everyone, thank you for joining us today. We are now four months into the pandemic, and the nearly $4 billion pre-tax loss that we just posted, reflects the severe impact that COVID-19 is having on our company and our industry. The June quarter was remarkable for a confluence of crisis that rocked our nation. In addition to the pandemic and its impact on public health and the economy, the issue of inequality and social injustice for Black Americans has been front and centered. In this environment, our number one focus is taking care of our people. This includes not only protecting the health and safety of our employees, but also maintaining our commitment to supporting the fight for equality and social justice. We are committed to listening and understanding. We must be a stronger advocate for justice and equality across our business, from our operating procedures to the programs that we offer our people, the support for policy change. Our people are the heart and soul of Delta, and I am incredibly proud of their perseverance and resiliency through these trying times, and forever grateful for the sacrifices that they are making for our company. Since demand bottomed in mid-April at less than 5% of our normal traffic, we've seen a small but welcome uptick in passenger volume, being driven almost entirely by domestic leisure travelers or those flying for essential reasons. And while it's encouraging to see customers start to return, the revenue environment remains challenging. We have thought from the start that the recovery will be choppy and the past few weeks have shown that to be true. We're expecting our overall revenue for the September quarter will be only 20% to 25% of what we saw last summer. And we've seen demand growth flattened recently with the rise in COVID-19 cases. We're watching trends closely and have pared back our capacity plans for August. Business travel, which typically provides 50% of our revenue is not yet returned in any meaningful way. With corporate offices slow to reopen, quarantine restrictions in markets like New York and Chicago, and states in the Sunbelt reversing or pausing reopening plans. We remain cautious on the pace of recovery through the balance of the year. In addition, there isn't a clear timeline when international borders will open for U.S. travelers. So it's against that uncertain backdrop that we are taking the industry's most conservative approach to capacity. For the September quarter, we expect our seats available for sale, which accounts for 60% load factor cap will be 20% to 25% of last year's level, up from 10% in the June quarter. Given how dynamic the current environment is, we are maintaining our flexibility, and we'll adjust our capacity plans as needed based on changes in demand. Since the crisis began, we have taken decisive actions to protect our people and our customers, increased our liquidity, and importantly, preserved our ability to respond in the future. Customer employee safety remain our top priority and restoring consumer confidence in travel is at the forefront of our recovery plan. We have taken extensive and proactive measures to implement a multilayer approach to protect customers and employees. Additionally, all of our aircraft are equipped with HEPA filters, generating high quality, hospital grade air quality onboard. Restoring consumer confidence to travel on Delta is the driving force behind our Delta Care standard, which includes requiring customers and employees to wear masks, enhancing clean protocols for aircraft, electrostatic spraying before every departure, blocking middle seats and capping load factors at 60% to provide more space onboard. We're committed to blocking middle seats through September and expect to continue our policy beyond that date as well. We've also created a Delta Global Cleanliness Organization and are collaborating with two of the world's best health organizations, the Mayo Clinic and Quest Diagnostics. The Mayo Clinic is helping to assess our safety protocols, consulting on how to improve safeguards, as well as designing COVID-19 testing for our full workforce, both for the active virus and the presence of antibodies. The added layers of protection are having an impact. Since implementing these changes as of the 1st May, the infection rate among our customer facing employees, those who spend their days working onboard our aircraft and in our airports, is well below the national average, providing another solid data point on the safety of air travel. In addition, our net promoter scores have never been higher, as customers recognize our health and safety efforts onboard and on the ground. Our top financial priority has been to protect our liquidity. Paul and the team moved quickly and decisively to raise capital, ending the quarter with $15.7 billion in liquidity. Entering this crisis with a strong balance sheet allowed us to access nearly $15 billion in new capital, on top of the $5.4 billion from the CARES Act without issuing equity. And while accessing capital is critical, the most important liquidity action we can take is reducing our cash burn. In June, our daily cash burn for the month averaged $27 million a day, a substantial improvement from the $100 million per day that we were experiencing in late March. The major force in that improvement is our cost performance which has been remarkable, as we\u2019ll take out over 50% of our total operating expenses for both the June and September quarters. That's due in large part to the more than 40,000 Delta people who have volunteered to take short-term unpaid leaves. Our crews who have seen their hours reduced as flying has been cut back, and the sacrifices made by our hourly and myriad ground employees, whose work schedules have been similarly reduced by 25%. I want to thank all the Delta people who volunteered for an unpaid leave. They're making a real difference in helping us navigate this crisis. We also want to thank all our colleagues who have been serving our customers in the face of this pandemic. The spirit and team work of our people is the difference has never shined brighter. With demand growth stalled at present, we expect July's daily cash burn to be similar to what we saw in June. As we go through the summer and into the fall, we'll continue to move quickly to balance what we're seeing in the revenue environment with our ability to get cost out of the business and keep us on the path to achieve our goal of breakeven cash burn by the end of the year. Given the combined effects of the pandemic and associated financial impact on the global economy, we continue to believe it could be two years or more before we see a sustainable recovery. So to succeed in this environment we are building resilience across the company in creating a new stronger Delta, albeit one that will need to be smaller for the next several years. That means accelerating strategies to streamline our company, simplify our fleet, and reduce our fixed cost base in ways not possible in the past. We have made the decision to permanently retire more than 100 aircraft this year, including the entire MD-88, MD-90, 777 and 737, 700 fleets. We have the most flexible fleet in the U.S. and are pulling for these and additional fleet simplification initiatives, which we believe will provide a lasting benefit to our cost structure. The difficult reality of resizing the airline is that we need a smaller work force until we see demand return. We'll be wrapping up our voluntary departure and early retirement programs this month, and as of last night, we already had over 17,000 employees voluntarily sign up to depart the company. We also have thousands more signed up for voluntary unpaid leave of absence into the fall. We are hopeful that we can accomplish the vast majority of the headcount changes we need through these programs, minimizing if not eliminating the need for involuntary furloughs. This will require creativity and collaboration across all of our work groups, and I'm hopeful that we can get there. And as we navigate this difficult environment, we're also working closely with our airline partners around the world, who are facing even more significant financial challenges. During the quarter both LATAM and AeroMexico filed for bankruptcy here in the U.S. under Chapter 11. And Virgin Atlantic is working through an out of court re-capitalization. While each of these is disappointing, none of our partners' home countries were prepared to provide governmental financial support, similar to what the U.S. treasury did with the CARES Act, which necessitated their decisions to restructure. We have the utmost confidence in all of our partners and remain firmly committed to our partnerships, which will be important when we rebuild a much more resilient international network in the recovery. In closing, we remain grounded in the strengths that are core to Delta's business, our people, our brand, our network and our operational reliability. These strengths and the shared values of the Delta family guide every decision we make, differentiating Delta with our customers and positioning us to succeed when demand returns. I want to thank everyone who's contributing to Delta\u2019s support and recovery efforts, through the most challenging time in the company's history. Our customers, partners, suppliers, owners, community leaders, government officials, their support has been overwhelming. And a special thank you to the finance group of airline professionals ever assembled, our Delta people for managing this difficult environment with grace, employees determined to return Delta to our position of leadership in our industry, and in our world. And with that, I'll turn it over to Paul to go through our financials. Paul? Paul Jacobson : Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everybody. This June quarter results we reported this morning illustrate the truly staggering impact of this pandemic on our business. Revenues declined 91%, and we reported a $3.9 billion pre-tax loss, one of the largest in Delta's history. Results exclude several items directly related to the impact from COVID-19 and our response, including $2.5 billion in impairment charges from fleet-related decisions, $2.1 billion in write-downs related to equity partners and a $1.3 billion benefit from the CARES Act grant recognized during the quarter. During this quarter, our total operating expenses declined $5.5 billion or 53%. The June quarter cost performance was more than $400 million better than our original expectations, in part due to the incredible contributions of more than 40,000 employees, who have elected to take voluntary unpaid leaves. With substantially reduced flying, fuel expense was nearly $2 billion lower compared to the prior year quarter, and we generated over $250 million of savings from parking more than 700 aircrafts. We were also able to reduce facilities expense by consolidating concourses and temporarily closing sky clubs, while eliminating nearly all discretionary spending. In the September quarter, we expect to achieve a similar 50% year-over-year reduction in operating expenses, despite a sequential increase in capacity. This reflects the increased variability we've achieved in our cost structure and what we've been discussing, since the COVID epidemic. As Ed said, our top financial priority remains to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity to whether whatever comes at us. To this end, we've taken decisive action to bolster our liquidity position, ending the quarter with $15.7 billion of liquidity. Daily cash burn also improved sequentially each month during the quarter to average $27 million in the month of June. This outperformed our initial expectation of $50 million cash burn per day during the month of June. One-third of that improvement came from better cost performance with two-thirds from an improvement in net sales, which inflected positive in early June and remained there. It's worth noting that approximately $10 million of our cash burn is attributable to our international business, so our domestic business is only burning $17 million a day, which is a testament to the efficiency of the reduced operation. As Ed mentioned, we are staying agile to balance what we're seeing in the revenue environment with our ability to get costs out of the business. This approach improves our cash burn trajectory, which helps us to preserve our balance sheet capacity for the future. The strength of our balance sheet has been evident during the pandemic, as we have raised $15 billion in new liquidity at a blended average rate of 5.5%. When combined with funds received under the CARES Act Payroll Support Program, we ended the June quarter with this $15.7 billion of liquidity. Even with no improvement in our cash burn rate, this equates to 19 months of liquidity. This is more than sufficient to address our upcoming maturities. But if needed, we have the ability to continue to raise additional capital through either our own efforts by leveraging our unencumbered assets, or electing to participate in the CARES Act Secured Loan Program. In an effort to ensure compliance and flexibility throughout the recovery, we also amended all of our bank credit facilities to permanently replace the fixed charge coverage covenant with the $2 billion minimum liquidity covenant. So in spite of the significant amount of debt we have raised, our adjusted net debt has only increased by $3.4 billion since the start of the year to $13.9 billion. Reducing our daily cash burn is critical to keeping the net debt down, and that is why we remain uniquely focused on it. In closing, while we have a long road ahead of us, we've made tremendous progress in just the last four months. By raising cash early and aggressively managing costs, we are prepared to navigate what will be a volatile revenue period, while making decisions to position Delta well for the eventual recovery. Our people have acted quickly and decisively to protect our customers and our company. And I'm so proud of what the people of Delta have accomplished with that grace, professionalism and determination that Ed mentioned. They are the reason I'm confident, we will emerge from this crisis as a stronger, more resilient Delta as our customers return. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jill to begin the Q&A. Jill Greer : Thanks, Paul. Cecilia, we are ready for questions from the analysts, if you could give them instructions on how to get in the queue. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Hunter Keay, Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : Hey, good morning, everybody. Ed, you mentioned, you recently said you expect some amount of business travel. I think you said 20% will turn out to be unproductive in retrospect and suggesting obviously it's not going to return. So what are some of the specific characteristics of the business travelers that do come back, that might be different from the ones who don't? Like for example, maybe they fly more per year, but to fewer cities, or these are the people that use lounges more often, things like that. So what do these people look like? And how do you win them or keep them? Ed Bastian : Well, first of all, Hunter, I think fundamentally, business travel is going to come back and it's going to come back at scale. I'm not the one that thinks that we are in a permanently depressed level of business travel for the foreseeable future. I do think there's a lot of inefficiency, which we can all appreciate in business travel. The number of trips that the average rogue warrior takes, I'm sure is going to come down. In certain cases, the international trips that we've all been on where we've flown over to Europe for a two hour meeting and flown back that does nothing but beat you up, and you'd certainly be much easily better accommodated over a video call. But it's going to be trips that are focused on relationship building, interacting, whether it's with your customers, conventions, new contacts, reviewing performance on a global scale. Those are going to stay. I just don't see there's a substitute for that over time. It will take some time to get back. I don't think we'll ever get back entirely to where we were in 2019 on the volume of business traffic. But the resiliency of the business traffic that we are going to now bake into our business model going forward, I think will be a better way to measure the sustainability of the recovery. Hunter Keay : And then another one for you, Ed. When was the last time you talked to Steve Squeri? And what is your single biggest shared commercial concern right now? And what is it that he tells you is most important to preserve the relationship and the economics that your company share? Ed Bastian : I talk to Steve all the time. He's not just a great business partner, he's a great friend. And we share our thoughts and strategies together. We are their biggest and most important business partner and American Express is ours in turn. And we're navigating this crisis together in a way that you would expect. I mean, they've seen some meaningful recovery over the course of the quarter in volumes on the card, which is certainly one of our bright spots in a dark quarter, the revenue recovery we're seeing on spend. But they provide a great lens into customer behaviors and the types of things that are going to be very important for Delta to maintain the position we have with the company. So, I continue as Steve does, to be optimistic of the future. We're both realistic, we realize the T&E spend is not going to be at the levels we saw in the prior years. But we're going to both do our very best to build a better future for our respective stakeholders. Hunter Keay : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Jamie Baker of JPMorgan. Jamie Baker : Hey, good morning, everybody. Paul, question on labor. So, as I see it there are sort of four moving parts here. We've got the voluntary unpaid leaves, which has already dropped off the P&L for now, but some level phase back in, in the future. We've got the early retirement, which will completely drop out. We've got what might happen after October 1st. And then I assume in the event of furloughs, you have some severance expenses. So what I'm trying to reconcile with these various flows is whether the net is that they temporarily give you labor costs relief in the fourth quarter. And that's what gets you to cash breakeven. But then labor costs potentially rise after that. I guess another way of asking is, in what quarter do you think your labor expense line will truly be reflective of the cost structure going forward? Paul Jacobson : Good morning, Jamie. There's a lot in that question. I think we're still really assessing the overlap right now between the early retirement and the voluntary leave program. So there's a sense of duplication there. But what it does do at an absolute minimum is it puts permanence around what were short-term leaves and volatility. So, we expect that in addition to the leaves that Ed mentioned -- I'm sorry, the separations that Ed mentioned voluntarily. We also have leaves that will continue on top of that. So we're going to continue to assess and see where we stand on the salaries and related line. There's no doubt that that's been a big driver of how we've gotten our cash burn down in quick action. And as we continue to shape the airline for how we think it's going to be sized next summer and into the future, we've got to be able to manage all of that agility and flexibility. And the voluntary leaves are going to continue to be an important piece of that puzzle going forward. So as we think about salaries and related, we should get to that kind of trend line I would think in that fourth quarter, first quarter, but then we'll see as demand shapes back, customers are ultimately going to determine how big the airline is. Ed Bastian : Hey Jamie, if I could add a couple thoughts. For the second quarter and the third quarter, we are reducing our total operating expenses by a bit over 50%, which is enormous. And that will continue to be our goal as we progress through the fourth quarter as well. And while the composition of the savings will be more sustainable given the size of the early out, so we have 20% of the company will be exiting. And as you can appreciate it's the senior most 20% of the company as well, which is going to give us an added benefit on top. So there's a lot of creativity and collaboration with our work groups, about reducing work, trying to protect jobs and everyone pitching in to work fewer hours, but to save more jobs. And that's across the company, there's a real spirit of doing that. So, whether I guess in the fourth quarter or first quarter, at some point the labor savings here are sustainable. But to answer your question more specifically, it's really going to be on the commercial side of the business. It's going to be much more important to getting us down to that breakeven level, as demand hopefully starts to grow, picks up once again, as we look into the late summer and fall. And that'll be the more important contributor to getting to a breakeven cash flow position. Jamie Baker : Okay, that's very helpful. A second multipart question. How do we think of loyalty in the remaining unencumbered asset pool? Does Delta have that flexibility to do what United did with loyalty in terms of sort of a quasi-securitization of both third party sales and intercompany cash flows? Or did you pledge SkyMiles as part of the loan? Paul Jacobson : So Jamie, we\u2019re an infinitely competitive business, but hats off to United for that execution, I thought they did a very good job with that. And it's one that I think is available to a multitude of carriers. That is not included in the most recent guidance that we've given of $6 billion to $7 billion of unencumbered assets. And we're looking at all of our options and we\u2019ll continue to keep them open. We have advanced the ball with the government by signing the term sheet, which they announced a couple of weeks ago. And we continue to move along that process, but we have not decided to take a government loan. And we're assessing really all of our options, as well as the environment that we're in. Jamie Baker : Thanks for indulging the questions. Take care. Operator : We'll go next to Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey, thanks. Totally agree with the perspective that Delta's been careful with capacity and how you brought it back. Just from an industry perspective, it looked like the industry has guessed wrong on July, at least so far. So schedules indicate your capacity is up about 90%, from June to July yet demand has stalled. So I'm just curious how cash burn can be similar in July versus June? Was it just that we had a good July 4th on the books before demand rolled over? Or is there something going on with debt payments and CapEx? Paul Jacobson : Well, I'll start with that Duane. First of all, good morning. The trajectory that we've been on and what we articulated through June was that we had seen steadily increasing net sales, that was coming really from both variables. Sales were going up and trending higher, while at the same time refunds have been trending down, which put us from a -- I think at the beginning we said $20 million to $30 million a day, we were burning in March to turning positive and staying there in June. So while we've seen that that sales growth level off in the wake of the latest rise in infections, and has remained relatively stable in that area. So, as we see the continued trajectory of reducing our operating expenses 50%, and keeping those net sales numbers relatively flat, that's where July comes out flat to June. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay. Thanks Paul, and maybe I'll stick with you. Just high level, how is your budget for aircraft rent change for this year, as we think about the net impact of a sale leaseback activity versus aircraft retirements? The only reason I bring it up is it looked like the op lease liabilities didn't really change much sequentially. So maybe you can help us understand what's going on under the covers? Thank you. Paul Jacobson : Yes. I think Duane, we'll take that offline and it'll be more apparent when the Q comes out later today of just the breakdown between financing leases and operating leases, under all the new accounting guidelines. So it's all there, but it has a little bit of a different geography to it, depending on the transactions. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay. I'll keep it there. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Helane Becker of Cowen. Helane Becker : Thank you very much, operator. I appreciate the time. Hi. So, I have two questions. One is your comments on international and the 777s that are leaving the fleet and some of the 767s. It seemed like you might have to do more pruning there. So, do you like retired enough aircraft do you think? Or do we expect to see more during rest of the year? Ed Bastian : Hi, Helane, it's Ed. International is going to lag domestic. I think we have some time to watch how it recovers. The 777 fleet for us was the sub-fleet that made the most sense to sit down. We certainly have additional international capable aircraft that we have a very large 767 fleet with opportunities to early retire, as we get a better sense for where the recovery is. But some of those decisions we have a little bit of time to take it. As I indicated in my remarks, there's more to be done. And we're not investing any money in that fleet, and we can see how international recovery is shaped before we make those final decisions. Helane Becker : Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you. And then my follow-up question really has to do with changes in booking patterns because of increased refunds, or because of more flexibility to people who book and then maybe cancel. So could you just address people booking and then actually showing up for the flights, especially in July? Are you seeing people booking and then canceling at the last instance? Glen Hauenstein : Helane, hi. It's Glenn. How are you doing? We've seen the no show rate -- good. Hope your summer is going well. We see no show rates grow from about 3% historically to about high-single digits. And most people at day of departure who have reservations are showing up for the flight. But the higher no show rates also makes it a little bit harder to revenue manage with the caps. So we've been managing through that. And we hope we can get better and better at that as we move through the fall. But clearly giving people more flexibility is where we need to be as there's so much uncertainty in the virus right now. Helane Becker : Got you. Thanks very much. Since I'm still in paradise prison, my summer is not going as well as I would like. But, thank you for asking. Glen Hauenstein : Right, we're ready to release you, Helane. Helane Becker : Not soon enough. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Joe Caiado of Credit Suisse. Joe Caiado : Hey, thanks. Good morning. My first question relates to your fleet and actually your order book. Any update on your discussions with Airbus regarding your order book there? And can you describe for us maybe what it is that that you're hoping to achieve there? Do you just want to sort of adjust the timeline for deliveries? Are you looking to restructure sort of the composition of the aircraft in the order book, just any detail there? Thanks. Ed Bastian : We are working with Airbus, as you can appreciate, and they've been very good partners with us managing the crisis. Clearly, we're in a situation where we don't need any aircraft. So we have a lot of aircraft on the ground, and doing our best to manage through the next 18 to 24 months to minimize deliveries. We're not ready to make any announcements yet. I can assure you there will be no cash CapEx on any aircraft at Delta for some period of time, certainly through the end of this year. And Airbus has been a very good partner. Joe Caiado : Got it. That's very clear on the CapEx. But I was curious, just especially as it relates to your comments on the expected timelines for recovery of domestic versus international. If you'd also be looking to adjust the actual composition of the aircraft that in your order book as opposed to just actually delaying or revising the timeline for the deliveries. And if I could just throw up my second actual follow-up, which is just a quick clarification for Paul. On the stalled demand recovery, did you say the July net bookings are flat with June, so they are positive month-to-date? Can you just describe in a little bit more detail the evolution in those net bookings trend over the last few weeks? Ed Bastian : No, that's okay, Joe. On your question Airbus again, we are not providing any specifics at this point, you can rest assured everything that we are doing is pushing a lot of the deliveries to the right. And when we are ready to -- we haven\u2019t reached the final plan with Airbus, when we do reach that plan, we\u2019ll be sure to let you know. Paul Jacobson : And Joe, on the cash burn, so we had seen a pretty steady progression upwards of sales and slight decline in refunds, really kind of from May to early mid-June. And that\u2019s when we started to see it stabilize. So the data that we have seen so far in July is pretty consistent with what we saw at the end of June, which is really reflective of what we've seen in this latest wave of infection throughout the country. And that\u2019s why we have got the confidence that it's somewhat stabilized here at these levels. And hopefully, if things start to improve we can see improvements of those levels as we get later into the quarter. Joe Caiado : Thank you very much. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank. Michael Linenberg : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Hey Paul, just back to how you are thinking about the ATL as we progress through the quarter? I mean normally under a normal year, the seasonal impact is that as we get to the latter part of the quarter, we tend to see it become a drag on cash, and I realize that this is not a normal year. So, are you sort of expecting that as we get into the latter part of the quarter that we will see it become a drag on the ATL? Or where is your thinking around that right now? Paul Jacobson : Good morning, Mike. That\u2019s a bit of a doocey [ph] of a question, because I think the one thing we all know is that the historical air traffic liability models have broken right now. It's not behaving in any way that a normalized seasonality pattern would have. As evidence, we have actually refunded now over $2 billion of that ATLs since the beginning of year, which the bulk of that has been done in the post-COVID, post-March 1, timeframe. So, we actually think that a lot of that refund activity particularly in the Trans-Atlantic and International destinations which were already booked pre-COVID heading into the summer, we have refunded a lot of that activity in it. So a little bit of a -- it\u2019s a big contributor to the international cash burn that I gave that comp position in my prepared remarks. So, we can actually see things stabilizing and we would expect that refunds will continue to trend down in the status quo. Obviously, it's going to be choppy, but any new sales data that come in, any new demand should be accretive to the ATL in a way that seasonally you wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect. So, we\u2019re prepared for that. I think the one given is that there is a lot of uncertainty here, which is why we have gone the route of really looking to raise as much liquidity as we can. Michael Linenberg : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then just maybe this is an easier one, you talked earlier about upcoming maturities and I'll throw CapEx in there as well. As we look to the second part of the year, what is CapEx? I am sure it's probably close to zero now based on everything that you have cut back or deferred. And you did allude or mentioned upcoming maturities, what are the big maturities for the second-half of 2020? Thanks for taking my questions. Paul Jacobson : Yes, sure. So, we didn\u2019t give any formal CapEx guidance, because it's really the same as we gave immediately after the COVID epidemic, which is we have essentially eliminated all CapEx. There is some technology spend on projects that are already in process and some small purchases here and there, but it\u2019s not material to the overall story. As far as debt maturities go, the biggest one we have is the $450 million maturity in December. When you combine that with a $600 million unsecured in April of '21, that\u2019s the unsecured deal that we just took out. So we\u2019ve already successfully refinanced that. And then we have the $3 billion bridge loan that is due in March, that has collateral attached to it that we haven't decided exactly what to do with that. As part of the amendment to the credit facilities, we also extended by one year a $1.3 billion maturity in April of our revolver. So that's pushed out to 2022. So we've actually gotten a very, very good handle on all of the maturities really for the next 18 months. Michael Linenberg : Great. Thanks for that. Operator : And we'll go next to Savi Syth of Raymond James. Savi Syth : Hey, good morning. Just a couple of follow-up questions on the cash burn. If we don't get much of an improvement on the commercial side, what do you think you can kind of get the cash burn by the fourth quarter with some of the incremental things that are happening on the cost side? Paul Jacobson : Hey, good morning, Savi. I think, as we've mentioned in our comments, we're kind of on this trajectory right now as things have stabilized. And we're continuing to assess what the second-half looks like. So as we continue to monitor capacity and demand that'll affect what we do on the cost input side as well. But, I think we're really counting on some continued improvement in demand, however gradual and however choppy that might be. We are 90 days into this and we already know a lot more about the virus. And that's giving a little bit more confidence in the longer and intermediate-term demand profile. But we've got to continue to be agile. So, I think we'll kind of be in this mid-20s level, as we continue to assess. And if we need to take further actions, we will. Ed Bastian : Hey, Savi. This is Ed. I don't want anyone to get a sense that we've got a gloomy forecast on revenue or demand growth, not at all. This is expected. We said at the start of this pandemic, that this is going to be choppy. It's going to be unpredictable. It's going to be driven by factors outside of our control. It's really advances on the medical front in containing the virus, it's advances by general public about wearing masks and doing their very best to be cautious and restoring confidence in air travel. I'm optimistic as we get through the late summer in the fall, we're going to see some real improvements here. We need to see improvements. And I think the sensitivity and the caution you hear in our voice for the current month is the fact that we're in the south and we're obviously under -- going back into a more of a closed setting in our local economy then opening. But at the same time, that's for the goal of reopening later this summer and fall to a bit of a better standpoint. So, I do think you're going to see continued improvement in cash burn. Cost on the margin could improve. But when you get more than 50% of your costs out, it's hard to see much more coming out. I think it's going to be the same type of momentum that we saw in June, hopefully reemerging in the latter part of the summer and early fall. That's going to make another material debt in bringing us down to that flat breakeven level. Savi Syth : That makes sense and helpful. And my other follow-up question is just on the business travel commentary. It looks like a lot of probably business travel might not happen until 2021, but just based on your surveys and things like that, is there any level of expectation of what we might see in the fourth quarter here? And kind of tied to that, I mean, there's kind of the block middle seats get removed when demand is stronger, or when the virus is a little bit more contained? What drives those positions? Ed Bastian : We're talking to our corporates all the time. As you can appreciate, we're doing a lot of work with them to get them more confident. They are starting to come back. They're in small numbers, but they're starting. And what we've been doing is taking them out with us on tours and seeing the airport. It's interesting for travelers that they spent their life as road warriors, the first time back in this environment it feels very different. And they need to refamiliarize themselves with what it's like and the benefits of air travel. And, I'd say the most significant observation that they give us is that it is actually not only safe, it's significantly better than what their view of air travel was pre-pandemic. So, there is confidence that's returning. I think you're going to see it improve as businesses start to reopen, I'd say post-Labor Day. Businesses start to open up as international operations start to slowly open up. You'll see that will be another driver for business travel. But business travel is going to clearly be at a 12 to 18 months lag, waiting for advances on the medical front, vaccines, therapeutics, reasons to think that it's safe, that companies can safely put their cut -- their employees back out in the road. The other thing, and I mentioned this in one of the interviews I did this morning, is that while the corporations may not be traveling, we know the individuals are traveling. And we see it in the SkyMiles data and our frequent flyer information. So people are learning about the new way of travel and they're telling us it's actually better than it was previous. Savi Syth : And does the block middle seat, is that kind of tied to COVID? Or is that tied to demand levels there? Ed Bastian : I'm sorry, I didn't hear that Savi. Savi Syth : Sorry. You mentioned that middle seating block probably continues beyond September. Just wondering what drives that decision? Ed Bastian : Well, that's going to be consumer confidence. We're going to hear from customers as to their comfort in travel. We've got a lot of flights that we have to add back yet and opportunities to add flights back before we have to worry about pulling up the middle seats. And, we\u2019ll get there over the course of the end of the year and into early next year. But, right now, I don't see a push to do that. Customers aren't pushing us to do it. And we've got -- I'd rather add more flights back and more seats into the market in the safe way than trying to maximize the number of people you can put on an individual airplane. And I think that would be in consistent with the brand that Delta represents. Savi Syth : It makes sense. Alright. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good morning everyone, and thanks for taking my question. So, I guess following up on that line of question, if business demand is going to lag here and you have some competitors out there they're going to come out of this without a lot of an incremental debt. What's going to be a competitive landscape? And how do you reposition your network to be more leisure-focused, maybe lower costs? And does that impact the kind of strategy you\u2019re really focusing on the branded products and everything onboard? Ed Bastian : Brandon, this is Ed. I'm not sure who you're referring to. Our incremental net debt is $3.5 billion at this point, so I wouldn't suggest that we have added a tremendous amount of increased debt burden on the company. Obviously, there\u2019s a large amount of money that we raised, but we also have a significant amount of cash that we can use to hopefully retire that, once we get through the other side. We're not changing our long-term goal for this company, this brand. We are a business oriented airline. We are a premium oriented airline. And there's nothing that I see from what we've been through the last four months that suggest customers aren't going to value premium, value the quality of the experience, the health of the experience. But we're going to be more resilient, because there's a portion of that trouble that will go away and we'll size our business accordingly. So, I don't see anything that gives me pause. Of course, there's going to be a lot of dislocation, disruption that always happens in this industry during times of crisis, but I think we're pretty well-positioned to come out of this in a relatively stronger competitive position than we were pre-pandemic. Brandon Oglenski : Well, I appreciate that response. And I know that looking forward as anyone's guess here but can you give us any clarity on what and I think maybe Paul alluded to what level of demand you\u2019re expecting to get to cash breakeven by the end of the year? And maybe even more importantly, where you're seeing the sizing of the network for 2021 as you make any difficult decisions? Paul Jacobson : So, at a really high level Brandon, if you look at our cash burn in June as well as in July and that $27 million a day number, virtually all of that needs to come through improvement in net cash sales. It's going to come in two ways, so one, the refund activity will continue to wind down. That will be a contributor in that and that's probably in the plus or minus $5 million a day improvement by the time we get to the end of the year, and which leaves about $20 million of cash sales improvement. And that's if you think of a company our size is about a 20% improvement in our overall business volume that will get us there. So, we'll probably need to see that $25 million come from the commercial side of the business, but that's still is the roadmap to get to breakeven. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Jill Greer : Cecilia, we're going to have time for one more question from the analysts. Operator : Thank you. That question will come from Joseph DeNardi of Stifel. Joseph DeNardi : Thanks. Good morning. Ed, I think over the last few years you and your larger peers have been of the view that the DOJ had kind of put a red light on additional consolidation. I'm wondering if you think that has changed or that it needs the change? And whether the calculus around how much liquidity you think you need takes into account that maybe consolidation is eventually part of the strategy? Ed Bastian : Joe, you know we can't speculate on that. Not to be [indiscernible] but that would be a really, really inappropriate response I'd have to give on that. Joseph DeNardi : Okay, fair enough. Paul, can you give us where you guys are year-to-date on mileage sales, cash proceeds? I think you did about $4.2 billion last year. Where are you guys year-to-date? Paul Jacobson : Yes, we've seen Joe about a 50% reduction in the last quarter. I think if you look at some of American Express's commentary, it's in line to even slightly better than some of the cards in their portfolio, which I think is encouraging. That means that that people remain attached to the brand and they see value in the miles program. So we're going to continue to see that, but it obviously has been far more resilient than the demand for tickets and for travel itself, which is what we expected. Joseph DeNardi : Thank you. Paul Jacobson : Thank you. Jill Greer : And that's going to wrap the analyst portion of the call. I will turn it over to Tim Mapes, our Chief Marketing and Communications Officer for the immediate portion. Tim Mapes : Good morning, everybody. We have about 10 minutes of questions from members of the media. I'd just remind everyone please, just a question and maybe a brief follow-up. We'll try to get through as many as we can. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Robert Silk of Travel Weekly. Robert Silk : Yes, good morning. In the Virgin Atlantic announcement day, they mentioned for their restructuring plan that they're doing this with the support of shareholders, Virgin Group and Delta, as well as some new investors. So I was wondering if there's any color or detail in the matter which Delta is supporting this effort? Ed Bastian : Not other than what's already been disclosed, which is that we are contributing through deferral of brand fees, as well as certain other joint venture fees that we would typically earn. We were excited to see the recapitalization come about. It's been an extraordinarily difficult few months holding that together. And all stakeholders have made some meaningful contributions to enable Virgin to fly again. And we're excited about that. Robert Silk : Thanks, Ed. Operator : We'll next to Mary Schlangenstein of Bloomberg News. Mary Schlangenstein : Hi. Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to see if you could breakdown for us how much of your second quarter revenue and possibly revenue going forward is from newly purchased tickets versus how much is from what rescheduled flying? Ed Bastian : Sure. We have about two-thirds of the revenue coming in from newly purchased tickets and about a third coming in from reissues and credits from postponed journey. So, getting a significant number of new journeys coming in, which is a good sign. Mary Schlangenstein : And I assume that the new ticket purchasing fell in this recent sort of slump as well as the reschedule. Is that right? Ed Bastian : If I could recharacterize it from a slump to really a much slower growth rate is that the industry had an awful lot of capacity going from June into July. And so what we've seen is in June, we were growing at about 20% every week, week-over-week. And I think maybe in some ways that capacity is going to take a little bit longer to get absorbed, because the growth rates are -- if you take 4th of July out, they're coming in between 5% and 10%, now. So the growth is at a much slower rate. As we look forward, it has slowed but it hasn't stalled. I mean, it's very flattish to up slightly, but it's not a slump. Mary Schlangenstein : Okay, thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Dawn Gilbertson of USA Today. Dawn Gilbertson : Hi, good morning. I think you mentioned employee coronavirus infections being down, because of all the measures you've put in place. Can we talk about passenger infections? We had the case, the recent case was Endeavor on the flight from Atlanta to Albany. How many instances is Delta seeing, hearing back from passengers after a flight about coronavirus infections and can someone put that into perspective for me? Thank you. Ed Bastian : Hi, Dawn. It's really minimal. The flight last week was an Endeavor flight as you mentioned and that was after the fact that those three customers found out. So there's no question that in the general population, there's a virus. And when we do find out, we go back and contact trace with anyone that would have been in the immediate vicinity of a customer. But I can tell you those instances are really, really small. And certainly, no instances that we've been aware of where there's been any transmission on board our planes. Operator : And did that answer your question, ma'am? Dawn Gilbertson : Yes, thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Tracy Rucinski of Reuters. Tracy Rucinski : Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask about the outlook for the trainer refinery. Do you have any plans to divest it or stop operations? Paul Jacobson : Good morning, Tracy. This is Paul. So, the trainer refinery in the quarter we had about $100 million loss in the quarter, which was almost entirely focused in the month of April. So the refinery is continuing to produce economics at breakeven levels on the current trends. And as with everything in the business we're looking at everything. But our plans have not changed with respect to the refinery right now. Operator : And our next question comes from Claire Bushey of Financial Times. Claire Bushey : Hi. I wanted to ask whether federal government needs to pass a law requiring mask on airplanes? Or do your flight crews have enough leverage with passengers since they can be banned from flying with the airline? Ed Bastian : Hi Claire, this is Ed. I don't know that it needs to pass a law. But I certainly see the opportunity to reinforce the work that the airlines are doing to ensure that customers wear their masks both in the airports as well as onboard our planes is helpful. The airlines are I think are doing a very good job of reinforcing that, as well as candidly customers on board planes. If someone's not wearing a mask, they quickly get pointed out and discussion with our flight attendants occur quickly. So, it's really important that we as a nation comply with mask policy or an industry that's got a lot of regulation. I don't know that we need another regulation around mask wearing, but it'd be helpful but stronger that our federal government can reinforce the need to wear masks, the better. Not just on air travel, but in life, in general. Claire Bushey : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Leslie Joseph of CNBC. Leslie Joseph : Hi, good morning. Do you have any idea of how many pilots need to be retrained on different aircraft, given the retirements and then also potential furloughs and just kind of rejiggering of what they're going to be flying and what the cost might be of that? Ed Bastian : Leslie, it's really premature. The pilot retirement plan still has almost a week yet to run. So we'll be in a better position to assess that over the next month. And we're continuing to work with Alpha to identify ways to mitigate the need to displace pilots and furlough. Leslie Joseph : Thank you. Tim Mapes : Cecilia, we have time for one final question, please? Operator : The final question comes from David Slotnick of Business Insider. David Slotnick : Hi, how are you? I'm wondering about blocking the middle seat. Have you gotten a sense from passengers or from surveys or anything that people are willing to pay a higher fare to fly a less full airplane? Ed Bastian : We have received a lot of customer feedback, and in fact, I would say when we surveyed customers today, about reasons you're purchasing a ticket on Delta, the space onboard the plane, the block middle seats has gone to the number one reason why customers are choosing Delta. They see it consistent with our brand. Everyone appreciates, it's not going to last forever. But in the face of a health crisis, that space onboard really matters and customers are telling that. We're seeing it in our net promoter scores, which have gone up considerably on a year-over-year basis, up 20 points in the month of June over last June, which last year was already a good number. And, we hear it from our corporates, we hear anecdotally from many of our travelers. David Slotnick : And are you looking at charging more of a premium or raising your fares or anything? Or is this more like a brand and marketing investment for later when things stabilize? Ed Bastian : It's not a brand or marketing investment, and no, we're not raising our fares to block the middle seat. This is, to us, a really important safety feature and it's a health crisis that we're in our country. By being the most disciplined and put it in terms of the amount of supply and capacity that we're offering, that's benefiting our pricing and yield of course. And that's helping us to have a better price onboard the overall cabin, so indirectly, that is coming through in price. But this is not -- that's not the objective. The objective here is to make certain that we're restoring consumer confidence in air travel and being true to our brand promises. David Slotnick : Thank you. Tim Mapes : That will complete the June quarter earnings call. Thank you to everyone for your time and your questions today. Have a great day. Operator : Again, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation today.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jill Greer : Thanks, Cassidy. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us for our September quarter earnings call. Joining us from Atlanta today are our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Paul Jacobson. Our entire leadership team is available for the Q&A session. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta\u2019s performance and strategy, Glenn will provide an update on the revenue environment and Paul will discuss cost liquidity in our balance sheet. We will then go to our Q&A and ask you to limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up so we can get to as many analysts as possible. Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta\u2019s SEC filings. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I will turn the call over to Ed. Ed Bastian : Well, thanks, Jill. Good morning, everyone. Appreciate you joining us today. This morning, we reported a $2.6 billion adjusted pre-tax loss on a 79% decline in revenues for the September quarter. We ended the quarter with over $21 billion in liquidity, having brought our cash burn down to $18 million per day in the month of September. And while we still have a long road ahead of us when you look through the large toll that the pandemic has taken, we are showing progressive improvement across the business, performing well on factors within our control and ensuring the company is well positioned as demand starts to return. And there are signs that customers are becoming increasingly confident in returning to air travel, with TSA counts growing each week. But we are still running at a fraction of our normal capacity and expect that our December quarter revenues will be 30% to 35% of what we saw a year ago. Put that improvement in context, our revenues bottomed out in the second quarter at only 10% of prior year levels. We are at 21% of prior year levels in the third quarter and we expect them to be roughly one-third of prior year levels in the fourth quarter. Steady improvement, as Q4 is expected to generate 3x the revenue of Q2, but still a long way to go. To see a meaningful step up in demand from here, we will need business travel to further improve, local quarantines to end, and international restrictions to lift, that will only come with widespread advances by the medical community and offices reopening, which many expect will start to happen in the first half of next year. As we all know, the path to revenue recovery is dependent on demand returning at scale. Until then, our focus is on doing a great job at what we can control, taking great care of our people and our customers, protecting our liquidity and managing our cost performance. For our customers, we continue to emphasize safety and health with the Delta CareStandard, our multi-layered approach that includes intense cleaning protocols, blocking middle seats, and requiring masks onboard our planes. According to IATA, with over 1 billion air travelers worldwide in 2020, there have only been 44 documented cases of suspected COVID transmission onboard an aircraft and virtually all of them were in the early months of the pandemic before masks and revised safety protocols came into existence. We carry at Delta over 1 million people a week and have had no documented transmission onboard any of our aircraft. The Delta CareStandard works and it\u2019s keeping our customers and our employees safe. And as a result, customers are increasingly becoming comfortable returning to the [air] [ph]. Our customer-focused approach is producing record net promoter scores, which reached 75 in September, which is up a staggering 22 points over the prior year levels. This is a testament to the Delta people who have continued to shine throughout this historic crisis, by restoring customers\u2019 confidence in travel and investing in their long-term loyalty and trust, we are creating a path to sustainable revenue growth in the future, but we do believe it could still be 2 years or more until we achieve a normalized revenue environment. Until then, we will be smaller in the short-term, but also more agile and more efficient. Today, we are already 20% smaller than we were at the start of this year, having reduced our fleet, our headcount and our overhead. These were difficult, but essential decisions that positioned Delta to emerge as a more resilient airline. We have resized our ground and flight attendant workforces by 20%. I am grateful to all those employees for the sacrifices from those taking early retirement decisions to the 40,000 staff who took unpaid voluntary leaves throughout the pandemic and thus reducing our labor cost for non-pilot groups by more than 40% over the past 6 months. This was the driving factor that allowed us to avoid furloughs and protect their jobs. We are still working with ALPA and hopefully we can achieve that same result with our pilots, but if not, we will be furloughing roughly 1,700 pilots on the 1st of November. We have reduced our fleet by retiring more than 200 aircraft this year and accelerated our fleet simplification to retire nearly 30% of our fleet or 400 aircraft by 2025 along with our revised Airbus order book. This cuts years off the timeline to achieving a higher engaged fleet with lower seat cost and a better customer experience. By making these structural changes to our cost base in this constrained environment, we will have significant cost and margin tailwind ahead of us as higher yielding business travel does return and our load factor [CAS] [ph] begin to ease and we are seeing early signs of our cost efficiency steps paying off as our fourth quarter all-in CASM is projected to be roughly flat despite a 40% reduction in capacity year-over-year, some incredible results and creates nice momentum heading into \u201821. The challenges of this year have reinforced our belief in the importance of investment grade balance sheet and our top financial priority will be to regain that as soon as possible. The first step in that process is getting back to breakeven cash flow. We had initially helped to be there by the end of this year, but as the virus has had greater impact on our business than expected that goal has shifted a few months. We expect to average a daily cash burn rate of $10 million per day in the December month with good line of sight to positive cash flow by the spring. Once we achieve that milestone, we will have a heightened focused on paying down debt. Putting all this good work into perspective, it\u2019s been about positioning Delta to accelerate into a post-COVID recovery. Do we know exactly when that recovery will happen or what it will look like? No. But by taking out complexity, simplifying our cost structure, improving our products and service levels now and maintaining strong employee morale in the face of this challenging time, we do know that we will be even more customer focused with a stronger brand and a solid financial foundation. And with that, we will be well-positioned to adapt and to win. Now, I will turn the call over to Glenn. Glen Hauenstein : Thanks, Ed and good morning, everyone. Since we last spoke in July, we have seen a steady progression in demand. This has resulted in our net cash sales improving from $5 million to $10 million per day at the beginning of the quarter to approximately $25 million to $30 million per day at the end of the quarter. That said, demand strength varied in different regions and segments of our business. Corporate demand has shown signs of modest improvement. And while the volume of corporate travel at the end of the quarter was 15% of last year\u2019s levels, corporate volumes are trending upward across all industries and we expect this to continue into 2021. Apart from the Caribbean and Mexico, international demand remains weak. This is largely due to government imposed restrictions in key markets. In the U.S., we have seen demand recover to 35% to 40% of pre-pandemic levels, with strength in leisure markets like Florida, the Mountain West and the beach destinations. However, cities that are under quarantine requirements like New York and Boston are recovering more slowly and are now just above 20% of pre-pandemic levels. As we approach the holiday travel period, we have been pleased with the recent booking trends for Thanksgiving and Christmas, which show that customers continue to gain confidence in booking further out. Our non-ticket businesses had held up relatively well during the quarter with both loyalty revenue and cargo outperforming passenger revenues. The strength in our loyalty revenue stream is in large part due to the spend on the Delta co-brand card. American Express has stated that the spend on our co-branded card has held better than other AmEx cards. We recently launched a card acquisition campaign after putting those efforts on hold and have had excellent response to this offering. This, in combination with spend trends that AmEx has seen suggests that our customers\u2019 aspirations to travel remain intact. As Ed mentioned, we focused on making sure Delta is well-positioned for a future recovery. We have been accelerating redevelopment projects in our airports and we were excited to open Concourse 8 in Salt Lake City. This was the first new U.S. hub airport to open in 20 years. In New York and Los Angeles, we are taking years out of our construction timelines, getting our customers a faster path to a better terminal experience, while also lowering our construction costs. I would like to call out our properties and facilities team for the excellent work they have been doing across the network on accelerating all of our airport projects. We have made it easier for customers to do business with Delta, eliminating most domestic change fees, extending Medallion and SkyClub benefits and refunding approximately $2.8 billion back to our customers so far this year. We are also rebuilding the network by leveraging our strength, focusing on connecting customers through our core hubs and adding capacity to coastal hubs only as demand returns. In the domestic network, 80% of our current capacity is on our core hubs of Atlanta, Detroit, Minneapolis and Salt Lake City. And in those subs, we are using our most cost efficient, highest gauge equipment as we retire less efficient aircraft. Internationally, a majority of our long-haul capacity is in our JV partner hubs where we are able to efficiently connect traffic. Similar to the domestic entity we are moving towards using our most cost efficient wide-body aircraft in our international operations by leveraging the A330s and the A350s and eliminating the subscale 777 fleets and sun-setting the 767-300 ERs. While the longer network rebuild is underway, we are also technically managing the network in the near-term. We are increasing capacity around the peak leisure holiday periods like Thanksgiving and Christmas, while reducing it during off-peak periods like Halloween and the election week. This approach will result in our December quarter capacity being 40% to 45% lower year-on-year or approximately 60% lower when you factor in our block seats. By doing so, we are aligning capacity with the emerging demand environment and our expectations that December quarter revenue will be down 65% to 70% versus last year. Before I turn the call to Paul, I would like to just thank our entire commercial team for all they have done in managing through these extraordinary times. We all know it\u2019s been a difficult 6 months, but we feel like we are very well-positioned for where we stand and where the pandemic is. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to my good friend, Paul. Paul Jacobson : Thank you, Glenn. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. This morning, we reported an adjusted pre-tax loss of $2.6 billion on revenue of $2.6 billion. This quarter\u2019s results exclude one-time charges that are due to our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including $2.2 billion in fleet-related charges, a $3.1 billion charge from the voluntary separation and early retirement packages, and a $1.3 billion benefit from the CARES Act grant funds. Our results this quarter were underpinned by a strong focus on costs as we reduced operating expenses by $5.5 billion or 52% similar to the decline achieved in the June quarter despite flying 23 points more capacity. We also expect our December quarter operating expenses to be approximately 50% lower year-over-year, producing a December quarter consolidated CASM that is flat to down on 40% to 45% lower capacity, a truly remarkable outcome. We have gotten here by resizing the airline by 20%. First, we had approximately 18,000 of our co-workers opt to take either a voluntary separation or early retirement package earlier this summer. In addition, we still have over 12,000 employees on a voluntary unpaid leave of absence, who will return at various times over the next 12 months. In total, the voluntary exits, the voluntary leaves, hour reductions and other employee initiatives have saved Delta over $1.9 billion in salary costs so far this year. Second, we accelerated our fleet simplification with our intention to retire our CRJ-200 fleet by 2023 and our 717 and 767-300 ER fleets by 2025. We have also reached agreement with Airbus on the restructuring of our order book. This restructuring reduces our aircraft purchase commitments by more than $2 billion in 2020 and by more than $5 billion through 2022. Our fleet actions will result in the retirement of almost 400 aircraft by 2025, including more than 200 this year alone. This will eliminate four fleet families, reducing complexity and driving meaningful cost savings in areas like maintenance and pilot training, while also producing a far better customer experience. So, while some of the cost actions we have taken this year are temporary and will come back as we rebuild the business, the changes we have made on headcount and fleet are structural. Those actions and the eventual easing of our load factor caps will allow us to bring capacity back in a measured way and it lower incremental costs providing future margin tailwinds for the business. Our strong cost focus has also allowed the increase we have seen in net sales, which is tickets purchased versus tickets refunded, to flow directly into an improvement in our daily cash burn, which improved from $27 million per day in June to $18 million per day in the month of September. Looking forward, we expect to see a progressive trend in our daily cash burn and currently expect to exit the year with an average daily cash burn of $10 million to $12 million for the December quarter. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the September quarter with $21.6 billion in liquidity and adjusted net debt of only $17 billion, up $6.5 billion since the end of the December quarter 2019. During the quarter, we raised $9 billion backed by the cash flows and IP of our SkyMiles program. The financing was nearly 6x oversubscribed and priced at a blended rate of 4.75%, an amazing outcome for the largest debt offering ever by an airline. Really, really great work and amazing execution by our finance SkyMiles and legal teams all working together to get that done. With our cash burn trajectory on track to achieve breakeven by spring and a solid liquidity position, our balance sheet work has already begun. Last week, we repaid the $3 billion outstanding under our 364-day term loan due in March of next year. We also paid down $2.6 billion we had drawn on our revolvers earlier in the year and that capacity remains available in the future. We have now flattened our near-term debt maturities with $2.3 billion of obligations due through the end of 2021. Our actions also freed up more than $3 billion in collateral tied to the term loan. As a result, we now have $9 billion to $10 billion of unencumbered assets, including newer vintage aircraft. We are on track to end the year with more than $16 billion in liquidity and adjusted net debt of approximately $19 billion. In closing, we made significant strides over the last 6 months. However, more hard work is still ahead to ensure that we build the foundation for Delta\u2019s recovery. I am confident that with the Delta spirit and values that our employees exhibit every single day, the airline will pull through and emerge stronger and more resilient. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Jill to begin the Q&A. Jill Greer : Thanks, Paul. Cassidy, we are ready for the analyst question period if you could give the instructions on how to get into the queue. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joe DeNardi of Stifel. Joe DeNardi : Good morning. Paul, you talked about all-in CASM being in line with 4Q \u201819 despite the lower capacity. Can you talk about what level of ASM, do you think you need to fly for ex-fuel unit costs to be in line with 2019 levels? Is it 70% of 2019 capacity? Is it 90%, is it 105%, what\u2019s the right way to think about that? Paul Jacobson : Yes, Joe. So we are looking at everything obviously on an all-in cost basis going forward. And I think it\u2019s important to note that we have managed to keep our total operating expenses flat - reductions flat over the last few quarters as we continue to ramp up capacity of the airline. As I mentioned in my comments, I think it\u2019s important to note that some of what we have done is obviously temporary and the balance here is making sure that we are bringing costs back at the same pace or at a measured pace with demand returning in our capacity decisions as well. Fuel price is going to be an important part of that. But as we look at where we are positioned today, fuel matters and we have got to make sure that we take that into account and the important thing is that we are flying as we said with capacity down, roughly 40% to 50% in the fourth quarter, but we don\u2019t have all of that available for sale even though we are absorbing all the costs of it. So, as we think going forward, we are positioning the airline to make sure we are all-in CASM at a reasonable level that can be absorbed as we grow capacity. And I think the team has done a good job of that. Joe DeNardi : Okay. And then Ed, along with the SkyMiles transaction, you provided revenue and profitability disclosures for the loyalty program, which highlighted how profitable and durable that portion of your business is, I am not seeing any of those disclosures being provided today that\u2019s something you alluded to doing at your June Investor Day pre-COVID. So my question is will you commit to starting in 2021 begin disclosing those same metrics revenue, EBITDA, cash proceeds for the loyalty program on a quarterly basis? Ed Bastian : Well, thanks, Joe. Yes, we are continuing to improve our disclosures. I frankly haven\u2019t gotten to the 2021 disclosure list yet. We are trying to get through 2020 first, but yes, you are right, when we \u2013 when you look at the transaction and you start to get a sense for the importance of the loyalty program to not just our balance sheet, but our overall future. It\u2019s a strategic competitive advantage, one of the most important ones we have and we will do, I think continue to do a better job of giving our investor base an appreciation for that, but at the same time, we also have to be mindful of the other sensitivities around that data. Joe DeNardi : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : Hi. Good morning, everybody. Ed Bastian : Good morning, Hunter. Hunter Keay : Paul on the \u2013 good morning, in the fourth quarter CASM ex to flat CASM ex, how much do we need to strip out for third-party refinery sales and what\u2019s been driving that line up so much over the last couple of quarters? And then more broadly, how do we think about the overall ancillary business expense on the P&L into 2021? Paul Jacobson : Yes, sure. Thanks for that question, Hunter. The refinery sales, as you know, we had managed a lot of that through exchanges for jet fuel. Obviously, with jet consumption down, we have had more volatility and just the fear of third-party sales is we are not able to exchange that. So, we are managing through that going forward and we expect that will be a little bit noisy as we continue through our recovery before things normalize both in terms of capacity at the airline and then as well as production and normalization at the refinery as well. As third-party expenses go obviously, we continue to see improvement on the horizon in our MRO business we have talked about that before with the opportunities ahead of us with the Pratt and Rolls Royce agreements going forward. Obviously, there has been some noise around that in the midst of the COVID pandemic, but we will continue to see expenses related to those go up as volumes increase, but that should be really be viewed as a separate kind of independent business as we think from the cost base of the airline itself. Hunter Keay : Okay. And then how many aircraft deliveries do you have now planned in relation to the 383 that you have coming out over that same time horizon? Paul Jacobson : Well, we reduced with the deal that has been announced today and the numbers in our fleet tables. We have taken out about 77 aircraft through the end of 2021 and kind of redistributed that over time as we continue to work through the impact of the pandemic. Hunter Keay : Thank you, Paul. Operator : Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good morning, everyone and thanks for taking my questions. Paul, just a quick clarification, I think you said you want to end the year with about $16 billion in the liquidity, but I think you ended 3Q at about $21 billion. Can you just help us bridge that? And then maybe off that last question like how are you thinking about CapEx into 2021, please? Paul Jacobson : Hey, thanks, Brandon. So, the obviously the two sort of impacts here are the cash burn, which we are reducing to $10 million to $12 million a day, which is roughly a $1 billion for the quarter. We also had $3 billion that we paid down the term loan and then there is some of the residual one-time payments to employees who are under the voluntary early retirement separation programs, etcetera that will continue to pay out into the fourth quarter. So, that\u2019s the reconciliation. Brandon Oglenski : Okay. And then, any view on CapEx next year? Paul Jacobson : I think it\u2019s too soon to tell at this point. I think what you heard in Ed\u2019s comments is that we are going to continue to focus on paying down debt as soon as we get to cash breakeven. And I think you are going to see similar discipline to what you have seen in the past that led to the balance sheet strength that we had pre-COVID. I think that\u2019s reinforced by this pandemic and we will manage CapEx accordingly. Brandon Oglenski : Alright. Thank you. Operator : Our\u2026 Paul Jacobson : And just one quick follow-up, Brandon, I also failed to mention apologies, the $450 million maturity in December is also a cash reduction. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jamie Baker of JPMorgan. Jamie Baker : Hey, good morning, everybody. A couple of questions for Glen. Can you remind us pre-pandemic what the top three or four types of businesses were that make up your corporate demand and maybe what percentage of total revenue they represent? Glen Hauenstein : Sure, sure, banking of course financial services and manufacturing and transportation. Jamie Baker : And roughly what percentage of total revenue does that account for? Glen Hauenstein : Did that account for? Jamie Baker : Yes, would that account for? Yes. Glen Hauenstein : This is an off the cuff number because I don\u2019t have that in my head. So, let\u2019s get back to you on that. Jamie Baker : Okay, fair enough. And second, can you discuss the sort of the evolution of the booking curve since March? And more importantly, what do you think has to happen to the curve in order to bring Delta closer to cash breakeven and do you see any structurally permanent changes in the curve post vaccine? Glen Hauenstein : I think it\u2019s too early to tell what permanent changes there are in the booking curve, what we saw of course at the beginning of the pack down, there was no bookings at all and cancellations to new bookings were like 100 to 1 in favor of cancellations. And as we move through this, we saw net positive in terms of bookings that was the first gate we had to get through in the early parts and then to positive booking in the second quarter, where we are actually generating positive cash flows. And now in the third quarter, I think we are still seeing a very condensed curve, but people really willing to look further out. So, we are seeing good booking momentum for Thanksgiving and Christmas and really even into the off-peak periods in December and into early January, we are seeing more activity than we had in the last month. So, every month we move through this, we see more and more customers with more confidence booking both close in and further out and that\u2019s what we continue to need to see that development and confidence. And I think when you think of what we have done with the brand and what we have done with the seating and the cleanliness and all the protocols we have put in place, it\u2019s all about building consumer confidence, because without consumers being competent, we can\u2019t do that. So, I think we have made a lot of great progress as an industry certainly more to go. We are on a good path. And hopefully we are \u2013 while we know we are closer to the end of the pandemic than we are to the beginning, but we don\u2019t know exactly how it\u2019s going to evolve from here to the end, so stay nimble. Jamie Baker : And if I can just squeeze in the third what stat are you looking at to determine when you lift the load factor gap or set of statistics I suppose? Ed Bastian : Jamie, this is Ed. We haven\u2019t made that decision yet. We continue to watch it. Obviously, it\u2019s going to be conditioned on consumer sentiment and confidence in air travel. I think as each week goes by, as Glen said that confidence is improving. A lot of studies coming out from experts about the safety of air travel and sometime in the first half of next year, I have no doubt we will be lifting those gaps, but we haven\u2019t picked a date yet and I would say, we will continue to start the new year with the caps in place. Jamie Baker : Thank you, gentlemen. Take care. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Savi Syth of Raymond James. Savi Syth : Thanks. Good morning. I think, Ed, you have said that it\u2019s not about building back to what was the building for the future although you probably put it a lot more eloquently than that. So, I was just wondering have your teams had substantial conversations with corporate customers to kind of get an idea of what the makeup and size of business travel may look like once kind of pandemic fears are behind us, especially now that customers have had a chance to see both like videoconferencing technology can and cannot deliver? Ed Bastian : Hi, Savi. Yes, we are in frequent daily conversation with all of our corporate customers and a couple of interesting stats. Today, we have roughly 90% of our primary corporate customers who do have travelers who are traveling small numbers in many of those, but they are getting their own sense for what the new travel experiences and anecdotally they are coming back to us with really strong reviews of safety and confidence in restoring their travel spent, how video technology is going to impact long-term business travel, I am of the view that it will have some impact, but it\u2019s not going to be a substitute, it will be a complement to business travel, it won\u2019t be a substitute for business travel. I don\u2019t think anybody knows. There is lots of experts out there that put states out as to when the new normal will be achieved. My sense is that we could be looking at anywhere from 10% to 20% reduction in the next couple of years when we get to that new normal of business travel. But the one thing I will also tell you, Savi, having been in this business for a long time, every crisis that I have been part of \u2013 and it\u2019s been a lot of crises over that 20 plus years. This was the first thing that people always talked about is that business travel was the death knell to business travel and technology was going to replace the need for travel and every single time business travel has come back stronger than anyone anticipated. So, I think we are going to see that same consumer behavior, it will undoubtedly be different, but I think it\u2019s going to come stronger than most of the pundits\u2019 view. Savi Syth : Helpful. And then if I might ask a clarification question on the cash burn, is the kind of the improvement from what you saw in September to what you are kind of thinking that you will see in the fourth quarter is that just is that from \u2013 has to come from our revenue given most of the retirements happened in August or are there some other drivers in that improvement? Ed Bastian : It\u2019s principally revenue. Savi Syth : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thanks for the time. So just on Savi\u2019s question there, maybe some longer term perspective from Ed or whomever, because I think you guys have been fairly thoughtful about the potential for longer term impairment in corporate and my question is, if that does play out, how will Delta offset that and work to restore its earnings power? Is this strictly a cost challenge and obviously, we have got some good news on that front in terms of what you have given us for the fourth quarter, is this strictly a cost challenge or do you think the industry can think about how it prices leisure travel differently than it has in the past? Ed Bastian : Well, there is a lot of speculation in that question, Duane. Today, we are 20% smaller as an airline and that certainly gives us a chance to resize the demand set. What impact that will have on international is still an open question. We are very well positioned with our help structure. We feel good about that base of travel, we are really getting great comments and compliments back from our corporate customers about the travel they are doing. So share is \u2013 while small share is very, very strong and we will see I wouldn\u2019t go out to try to suggest what kind of changes certainly there will be some interesting opportunities to look at the new business around pricing and in competitive markets, but we are doing what we do here, we are playing the long game. And over the long-term I am confident that the strength of our service levels, the focus of our people on taking good care of our customers will be the most important thing of anything out there. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thanks. And maybe if I could sneak in a shorter term one just on the down 40 capacity in the fourth quarter, would you be willing to talk about the cadence by months and any early look into the first quarter? Appreciate you taking the questions. Ed Bastian : Duane, we don\u2019t have a good enough crystal ball in this environment. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay, but it does feel like it implies a bit of a pickup into November and December. Ed Bastian : Modest, again, very, very small. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg of Deutsche Bank. Mike Linenberg : Yes. Hey, good morning. Two quick ones here. Paul, just on CapEx \u201821 and \u201822, I think you have said at least through \u201821 you are going to take 77 more airplanes at least on a gross basis, could you give us what CapEx what a rough forecast is for at least next year? Paul Jacobson : I think a little bit premature to give total numbers for next year. We talked about a $5 billion reduction, but it\u2019s important to note in this environment, all of the aircraft are going to come with financing in place for that. Mike Linenberg : Okay. Paul Jacobson : We need to make sure obviously, we will have decisions to make as we go into 2021 depending on the balance sheet, the pace of recovery, cash, etcetera, but we have got facilities in place to be able to backstop finance those aircraft if needed. Mike Linenberg : Okay, fair enough. And then just my second question, the headline out recently where it looks like the Brazilian regulators are going to put the Delta LatAm deal on trial. And that\u2019s of course after they approved it can you still proceed and move forward regardless of an ongoing trial, does that prevent you from doing what you want to do? Peter Carter : Hey, Mich, it\u2019s Peter. Good morning. Mike Linenberg : Good morning. Peter Carter : A couple of things, one is our joint venture is under review with the U.S. Department of Transportation. Mike Linenberg : Okay. Peter Carter : For that to go forward, we will need those approvals. Of course, we do have code share agreements with them, which are ongoing. And we do expect, we do anticipate that the Brazilian tribunal will approve the transaction. This is just the second look. Mike Linenberg : Okay, very good. Thanks for that, Peter. Operator : Our next question comes from Helane Becker of Cowen. Helane Becker : Thanks. Thank you very much, operator. Hi, everybody and thank you for the time. It\u2019s completely unrelated to things that we have been talking about. You guys had an open pilot contract prior to COVID starting and I am just wondering if the negotiations that you are undertaking prior to November 1 include a stage to that contract or if that\u2019s just on hold? Ed Bastian : Helane, we are not going to talk about negotiations publicly. But what I can tell you is that the focus is trying to find a way to eliminate the need to furlough 1,700 junior pilots, and we have given ALPHA, the union a lot of different options. And I am hopeful we can reach resolution, but I am not trying to suggest or forecast that. Helane Becker : I understand that, just understanding that the main part of the contract is on hold until we get through this part. Is that right? Ed Bastian : I would say that\u2019s a fair observation. Helane Becker : Okay, good. And then my other completely unrelated question is on the airport construction acceleration and all the other stuff that you are doing, which obviously will help improve customer experience as we come out of this? Can you just talk about some of those things? Are there thermal camera imaging going into place? Are there testing centers for COVID or other things? How is the airport going to look going forward and how should we think about the cost associated with landing fees changing next year if you are smaller and everyone else was smaller I guess we should think landing fees going up, is that true? Ed Bastian : Well, you asked a lot of questions in there. Our main focus is to take advantage of the reduced volume of travel to accelerate progress and getting our new facilities filled in LaGuardia, LAX Seattle, which has opened up to brand new Salt Lake City airport, which is magnificent. Hopefully, you all get a chance to get out there and see it sometime soon. And that\u2019s been the single biggest focus, yes, we are working on particularly for international travel pilots by which we can start to open up lanes of international travel, which I believe will testing will be an important ingredient to getting there and working with airport authorities as to how we would administer that we are working both there and here in the U.S. as well as overseas working with those authorities, working with the CDC in very close contact. So, I don\u2019t foresee them having big structural changes. I don\u2019t see testing being conducted, for example, on a U.S. basis before people fly, it could see it for international. Relative to thermal and temp screening, we have asked TSA repeatedly to take that over as part of their screening services and right now we have been unable to convince them of that. So, I know a few airports are working on that, but again, I don\u2019t see that being a meaningful change to the airport infrastructure. Helane Becker : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Ed Bastian : And your question on landing fees, I can\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t know, I think our airports have done a very good job of minimizing their own cost and taking advantage of where they have received some government support using that to reduce cost, but \u201821 is an open question. Helane Becker : Got it. Okay, thanks for your help. Operator : Our next question comes from David Vernon of Bernstein. David Vernon : Hey, guys. Thanks for the time. So, Paul, first question on the balance sheet, can you tell us kind of what the maturities look like over the next 24 months? If we end the year at $15 billion, $16 billion, is there anything that\u2019s going to be coming due and is there any flexibility in renegotiating? Paul Jacobson : Yes, we \u2013 thanks, David. We have done a lot of that work today. So the biggest maturities that we have we will get a $450 million unsecured maturity in December that I referenced earlier. We have a $600 million unsecured maturity in April. Previously, we had already pushed out our revolver into 2022 and we have got primarily just beyond those two amortization payments now that we have paid off that bridge loan. So, I think it\u2019s very manageable under $2 billion over the next kind of 15 to 18 months. David Vernon : Alright, thank you for that. And then, Ed, maybe on the topic of testing, we have been looking at that quite a bit. And I am wondering what your perspective is on timing for when you think either through testing with partners or testing with international other \u2013 international entities when you might start to think that the quarters of international travel may start to open up? Is that something that we should be thinking about in the next sort of 3 months, 6 months, 9 months like how are you thinking about that in general? Ed Bastian : Well, we are laying down that we are laying the tracks to create the testing environment obviously the advancement in the development of rapid tests are key to that, not only in terms of a fairly quick turnaround, but also a relatively low cost. As you know, the U.S. government has already acquired large supplies in advance of that. So, we are talking to the government about that. But I think when you try to put a timeline on it, one of the big wildcards is how the virus is doing both here in the U.S. as well as in other countries, because the goal in all this is to eliminate the need to quarantine when you get to your destination. And as we see going on in Europe right now we are seeing another wave of the virus starting to spike across Europe and that is of concern to the local authorities. Certainly, they are concerned likewise here as to seeing rising case counts in the U.S. So, I\u2019d say that your timing has more to do with the state of the virus and the medical containment of it than it does any specific strategy that we could deploy to make certain to everybody stay safe, because the goal in this is that we want to eliminate quarantines. David Vernon : And would there be some work you would need to do to kind of integrate some of the rapid tests and the QR codes and things like that into the boarding process or is that stuff you guys have already figured out? Ed Bastian : We are looking at how you could deploy rapid testing as part of the check-in and boarding process, yes. David Vernon : Thanks very much, guys. Ed Bastian : Thanks, David. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Caiado of Credit Suisse. Joe Caiado : Hey, thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. Just a quick one first, can you comment on the trends in American Express card spend in the third quarter, just how that compared with the second quarter? And to the extent you can comment on it, how that\u2019s trending here in the fourth quarter month-to-date? Glen Hauenstein : Well, we don\u2019t give specifics on it. I would say the trends have been improving. I think we disclosed that we were down about 20%. And so we have seen that 20% come back up and most encouragingly, we have watched the T&E lines within the card and their progression. And at the worst of the crisis, the airline spend was actually a negative number, it was minus 103% and we have seen that consistently move up and now we are down in the low 70s. So, that\u2019s another exciting sign for us. Not only is the total spend improving, but the spend on airlines itself is improving dramatically. So, I think that\u2019s about all the color we can share. Joe Caiado : That\u2019s great. I appreciate that, Glen. And then just maybe another quick one, for Paul, I think you have previously talked about sort of the base level of investment just to maintain the business. So maintenance non-aircraft CapEx is being maybe $500 million to $700 million a year. Obviously, you took that pretty much to zero this year, but that\u2019s obviously not sustainable long-term. My question is just given all the structural cost reduction efforts across the enterprise, is that still roughly the ballpark for run-rate maintenance CapEx 2 or 3 years out or is that run rate number now lower as well? Paul Jacobson : Well, I think certainly we are 20% smaller than we were before. So, I would argue that it\u2019s probably a little bit lower than what it\u2019s been, but a lot of this is going to be timing and we see this in terms of what we are doing across the fleet and really kind of optimizing, but we are not missing out on the opportunity to accelerate where we can, particularly in technology and that space and the facilities that we have already mentioned. So, I think that probably $500 million is a good range, but I expect that we are going to want to drive the airline to better cash performance to enable us to invest more. And that\u2019s really the message here is that, we have got to continue to invest within our means, while we have the additional goal now of paying down a substantial amount of debt over the coming years and through the recovery. Joe Caiado : Understood. Thanks, Paul. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Didora of Bank of America. Andrew Didora : Hi, good morning, everyone. Paul, as you get through the crisis and you implement your fleet simplification plan, what kind of unit cost savings can this give you say versus 2019? And is there anything that you are willing to share about where you would like your unit cost structure to be as the industry returns to a more normalized trend? Paul Jacobson : Yes, thanks for that question, Andrew and we haven\u2019t given any specifics on the unit costs around that. But when you look at the gauging potential, the fuel efficiency, the simplification of all overhead functions, around training, around maintenance, tooling etcetera, we have previously said as part of our Investor Day that it was worth billions of dollars a year as we complete that. What we have been able to do is as to-date probably accelerate that timeline by more than 5 years against where we thought we were going to be pre-COVID. So, I think as we position the airline going forward, there is no doubt that we are very, very focused on keeping CASM below pre-COVID levels. I think the jury is out as to how effective we can do that based on how demand returns and how CASM come or how capacity comes back. But I think the early returns based on what we are able to \u2013 what we think we are going to be able to do in the December quarter is going to be a pretty good early indication of our focus working in the right direction. Andrew Didora : That\u2019s great. Thank you. And then, just sort of a near-term modeling question, when I just look at your peer salaries and wages line item, it\u2019s been at about $2 billion in the last two quarters. Do you think that\u2019s a good baseline to work off of going forward here or can you get that down a little bit more with some further workforce actions? Thanks. Paul Jacobson : Well, I think, Andrew, as we have talked about, we are currently not anticipating any furloughs of ground and flight attendant employees. And with the leads that we have taken, we are approaching a pretty good run rate on where we would expect to be going forward. So beyond the actions that we have already announced and potentially a transaction with the pilots or managing to get that cost out, there\u2019s a little bit more to go. But I think largely, we have done what we needed to do to date. Andrew Didora : Okay, great. Thank you. Jill Greer : And Cassidy, we are going to have time for one more question from the analysts. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Myles Walton of UBS. Myles Walton : I know probably a little premature question, but thinking about the long game, Ed, with the Airbus delivery schedule cleaned up, retirement plans set through \u201825, is now the right time for opportunistic overtures to Boeing for thinking about an order, given the pro forma fleet in that out-year still 40% Boeing, but obviously, your order book there is still essentially zero? Ed Bastian : Hey, Myles, I get asked that question by the press all the time. And I will give you my standard response is that we talk to the OEMs about all aircraft all the time and always looking for opportunities. So I don\u2019t have anything to report on that, but you can be rest assured that we are always looking for opportunities where we are able to advance Delta. Myles Walton : Is there a reason for the 2025 dating of the retirement plan for the 67 and 17s in particular? Ed Bastian : No, it\u2019s just a convenient 5-year interval. Obviously, there will be more retirements, post \u201825, but it\u2019s \u2013 we figured 5 years is a pretty long look given what we have been through this year. Myles Walton : Okay, thanks. Ed Bastian : Sure. Jill Greer : And that\u2019s going to wrap up the analyst portion of the call. I will now turn it over to Tim Mapes, our Chief Marketing and Communications Officer. Tim Mapes : In addition to welcoming all the members of the media to the call in the few moments that we have here, Cassidy, if you wouldn\u2019t mind just reiterating the instructions for each of them to enter the queue. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Tracy Rucinski from Reuters. Tracy Rucinski : [Technical Difficulty] that was repaid by GOL and how much\u2026 Operator : And Ms. Rucinski, if you don\u2019t mind just repeating yourself, we are now able to hear you. Tracy Rucinski : Sure. So about the Brazil GOL\u2019s loan that was refinanced last month, can you tell us how much was repaid by GOL and how much is outstanding and refinanced? Paul Jacobson : Hey, good morning, Tracy, this is Paul. So we had a \u2013 we didn\u2019t actually have a loan to GOL. We had a $300 million guarantee. And what we did was restructured that guarantee and lent them $250 million. And we have got amortization payments that are required, and they are current with that loan. So that\u2019s where it currently sits. Tracy Rucinski : Okay. And then, just given your strong liquidity position now, are you planning to inject any cash into LatAm or Aeromexico? Ed Bastian : We have no plans at the present, Tracy. We need to get through our own crisis here first. Tracy Rucinski : Okay, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Alison Sider of Wall Street Journal. Alison Sider : Hi, thank you, and I was wondering if you could just tell us anything about kind of what you are seeing or where things may stand in Washington over Atox. We have seen a lot of your peers, other top airline executives spending a lot of time in Washington and pushing for more aid and at least publicly, haven\u2019t seen you there as much and wondering why that is? Ed Bastian : Well, we certainly support the extension of the CARES Act 2 as it\u2019s been labeled for PSP for airline workers. And I certainly hope given the strong bipartisan support that exists that a vehicle for that extension can be found here soon to be able to bring 32,000 airline industry employees back to work. We are fortunate we haven\u2019t had to furlough anyone yet to this juncture. I do want to acknowledge the great work of the Delta team in making a real difference. We are not facing furloughs in any work group with the lone exception of the pilots. We still have an overstaff situation where we are trying to work with the union on, but every other workgroup within Delta, we have been able to manage to mitigate it through all the voluntary leaves, 40,000 people taking unpaid leaves throughout the summer. 20% of our employees have opted to early retire. We have had reduced hours and work schedules, shared jobs. It\u2019s been incredible. And excluding the pilots for the moment out of the labor cost, we have been able to save 40% of our employee costs over the last 6 months as a result, which is eliminate the need to undergo furlough. So, that\u2019s my view on that. Where this goes, I have no idea. It seems to change by the day, if not many times within the day. We are still hopeful something will happen. Alison Sider : Okay. I guess you see it as less of a priority for Delta then sort of given your success getting labor costs down in other ways? Ed Bastian : I don\u2019t think it\u2019s less of a priority for Delta. I think that with the large numbers of furloughs that are at other airlines, it\u2019s a heightened priority there, but we would be pleased to see that extension given to all the industry. However, the industry and everyone within the industry has managed the crisis a bit differently. The reality is the virus is not at the level of containment that we all thought it would be when the first grant was issued and we will all need additional time to get our businesses in a better spot over to get ready for next year. Alison Sider : Thanks. Tim Mapes : Cassidy, we need to get Ed and the members of the leadership team to an employee town hall, but we have time for one final question, please. Operator : Our final question comes from Leslie Josephs of CNBC. Leslie Josephs : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Good morning, everybody. Just a quick question on the loyalty program, you said you are seeing spending \u2013 you expect spending to increase in the fourth quarter. Do you have any detail about where you expect spending to go in the first and second quarter and how that could contribute to you breaking even or you can go into cash flow positive? Ed Bastian : Well, clearly, the loyalty program and the American Express deal have been great advantages for us through this pandemic. We have seen continued spend improvement through the second, third and now fourth quarter. And I think it\u2019s too early for us to go out and say that what Christmas will be like or what the post-Christmas spend will be, but the trends that we have seen today are very encouraging. I think a lot of that also has to do with does a stimulus bill gets passed either in November or in January. So, there are a lot of factors that weigh into how people spend on those cards, but I would say we have been very encouraged by the trends we have seen. Leslie Josephs : Okay. And would that contribute to you going cash flow breakeven or cash flow positive? Do you know as to what degree or what the market is on it? Ed Bastian : No, we are not going to disclose that, but it\u2019s a significant contribution. Leslie Josephs : Okay. Thanks very much. Tim Mapes : Great, Cassidy. Thank you very much, everyone. Appreciate everyone\u2019s time. We will look forward to speaking with everyone in January. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Cathy, and I will be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Greer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jill Greer : Thanks, Cathy. Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us for our December quarter and full-year 2020 earnings call. Joining us from Atlanta today are our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our Interim Co-CFO, Gary Chase. Our entire leadership team is available for the Q&A session. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta's performance and strategy, Glenn will provide an update on the revenue environment, and Gary will discuss cost liquidity in our balance sheet. We have extended our call today to 90 minutes total to make sure we have plenty of time for questions. For analysts, we ask you to please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up, so we can get to as many of you as possible. After the analyst's Q&A, we will move to our media questions. After this, Ed will provide some closing remarks. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I'll turn the call to Ed. Ed Bastian : So thanks, Jill. Good morning, everyone. This morning we reported pretax losses of $2.1 billion for the December quarter, and $9 billion for the full-year, capping the toughest year in Delta's history. We've been saying all along that this recovery wouldn't follow a straight line, with demand choppiness as COVID infections rose across the country, and government and public health officials issues travel advisories, our revenues, of $3.5 billion for the fourth quarter, was just 30% of last year's levels. And although we still have the tough winter ahead of us, we're encouraged by the progress that's been made on the vaccine front, and are confident that Delta is positioned to successfully lead our industry into recovery as the year unfolds. While 2020 was a challenging year, we delivered results for all of our stakeholders. For our employees, we prioritized protecting their health and safety, and preserving our culture. For example, throughout the past year we have offered and continue to offer an extensive employee testing program and paid protection programs for employees diagnosed, exposed, or at high risk of COVID-19. We have had remarkable volunteerism, up to 40,000 employees taking unpaid leaves throughout the summer to protect jobs and preserve cash. And in fact, we still have over 10,000 employees in the month of January out on unpaid leaves. And we have made it through this year without furloughing any employees. Our emphasis on taking care of our people is reflected in Delta's recognition this week by Glassdoor as one of the best places to work for the 5th year in a row, coming in seventh overall on a list of 100 large companies, the highest rank Delta has ever received, all in the face of a pandemic, really incredible work by our team. For our customers, we're keeping them at the center of our recovery. Our health and safety efforts on being the only major U.S. airline that continues to block middle seats, to partnering with leading names, like the Mayo Clinic, Emory Healthcare, Lysol, and Purell in developing the Delta care standard, to launching the industry's first COVID-tested transatlantic flights with no quarantine on arrival, are all targeted at restoring consumer confidence in travel, and reopening borders, which will be an important driver of revenue growth in the future. Our customers recognize the outstanding service our people provide with an all-time high December Net Promoter Score of 71, up 20 points year-over-year, and by Business Travel News naming Delta the top airline for corporate travelers for the 10th year in a row, and once again coming in first place on all 12 metrics that they measure in the survey. That customer preference and loyalty is what underlies our revenue premium, and has never been stronger. And finally, for our shareholders, we secured our liquidity position and rescaled our cost structure. We reduced liquidity risk by raising over $25 billion in capital since the pandemic began. With approximately $17 billion of liquidity our adjusted net debt however only increased $8 billion year-over-year and we don't expect that net debt will increase going forward. We've swiftly removed cost from the business with three consecutive quarters of operating expenses declining by nearly 50% or more, increasing the variable nature of our cost structure. In fact, in the December quarter, our all-in unit costs were down 4.5% year-over-year despite flown capacity being down 44%. That is a remarkable achievement, and credit to all Delta employees for making that happen. And by keeping our cost under control we've leveraged the modest increase in net sales to reduce our average daily cash burns $12 million a day for the December quarter, half of what it was in the September quarter, and a decrease of 90% since the early days of the pandemic in late March. Turning to 2021, we expect the March quarter to look similar to the December quarter, with March quarter revenues at 35% to 40% of March quarter 2019 levels, and our cash burn for the quarter holding at $10 million to $15 million per day. We expect that will be followed by an inflection point this spring as vaccine distribution continues, travel restrictions start to ease, and consumer confidence begins to grow, hopefully resulting in cash burn reaching breakeven or better by the second quarter. And as the year progresses, we expect demand will start to accelerate as vaccinations become more widespread and the virus is in a contained state, and customers gain greater confidence to make future travel commitments. This should enable a sustained recovery to begin in the second-half of 2021, with a return to profitability this summer. So, as we work through this environment, we're focused on five things. First, as always, we're committed to keeping our culture intact and our employees engaged. The Delta people are our most strategic asset. We have done a tremendous job this year, and together we'll lead our airline through the recovery. Second, we'll continue to prioritize the customer with a focus on health and safety, and the maintenance of the industry's strongest network, thereby increasing loyalty and preference for our brand. Customers have shown they are willing to pay more for the quality of our network, product, and our service. The gains we have achieved in customer satisfaction position us well to drive sustainable revenue growth in the future. Third, we'll maintain our focus on innovation, which will enable our employees improve the customer experience and drive efficiency through the business. And innovative thinking will power our ability to tackle big challenges in front of us, like our goal of achieving carbon neutrality in the next decade. Fourth, we'll drive a competitive cost structure. Given the changes we've made over the last year, our goal is to sustain our non-fuel unit cost at or below 2019 levels by the December quarter of this year, on roughly 75% of 2019 capacity levels, displaying continued agility in managing our cost. And finally, we are committed to debt reduction and creating long-term shareholder value, including continuing to protect our owners so that they can participate in future upside without dilution, because for investors while the near-term demand path is murky, industry fundamentals remain intact. Following almost a year of subdued travel customers are beginning to exhibit behavior that is indicative of pent up demand. Shopping visits across Delta's digital channels are significantly outpacing the passenger volumes we're carrying. In our most recent corporate survey, 40% of respondents expect full recovery by 2022. Our partners at American Express are also seeing encouraging signs, whether it's cardholders holding on to their points in anticipation of redeeming them for air travel, for a recent survey that suggested approximately 70% of respondents expect to take a trip in 2021 after not traveling in 2020. Although it will take time, customers want to travel again when they feel it's safe. They feel they've had a year of their life taken from them, and they're starting to get ready to reclaim. Until then, we're fortunate to have the support of the U.S. government which recognizes the importance of the airline industry, and we thank Congress and the administration for passing the COVID relief bill last month. As a result of that bill, we anticipate receiving approximately $3 billion in addition -- in additional payroll support funds, largely on terms similar to the initial CARES Act program. These funds have been critical in saving thousands of industry jobs during an unprecedented level of demand decline, and it's why the U.S. airline industry is in the best position to recover from the pandemic over any other international market. So, while 2020 was a difficult year and challenges will continue in 2021, I'm encouraged by some of the data that we're seeing, and I'm proud of the foundation that we built at Delta. This company is well positioned to emerge in a stronger competitive position from this crisis, and we'll continue to lead our industry in the years ahead. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Glen. Glen Hauenstein : Thanks, Ed, and good morning everyone. As Ed mentioned, we started the December quarter seeing encouraging demand trends, but with rising COVID cases and travel advisory we began to see some weakness around Thanksgiving and into December. Despite that softness, the peak periods continue to outperform non-peak periods, and we've seen sequential improvement in total revenues, which recovered from being down 80% in the September to down 70% in the December quarter on salable capacity that was down 62%. On January 3, we had a $15 million ticket revenue day, and carried more than 250,000 customers. Both of these were the highest since the onset of the pandemic. And despite having meaningfully less inventory per sale giving our middle seat block, we outperformed on passenger revenue generation in the first nine months of the year. This is a testament to customers' willingness to pay a premium for the Delta difference. Leisure markets and sun destinations are the best performers in our network, with our approach of targeting salable capacity to match demand we are biasing restoring capacity to leisure markets. As result, roughly one-third of our domestic capacity is currently deployed into leisure destinations. Our coastal hubs, especially New York and Boston, are still some of the weakest areas in our network with demand in those hubs only 20 to 25% recovered. International demand remains weak and is limited to essential travel. That said, we continue to work towards opening additional COVID tested lanes of travel with no quarantine on arrival similar to our Atlanta and Rome -- Atlanta to Rome and Atlanta to Amsterdam flights. This will be important in restoring confidence in long haul international travel as vaccine rollouts continue. Our premium seat strategy is holding up well. Domestic premium revenues performed in line with main cabin in the quarter. A good outcome considering that we are continuing to operate in largely leisure driven environment with higher proportion of premium seats held back due to our middle seat blocks. As all of you are aware, corporate demand continues to be depressed and was only 10 to 15% restored for the quarter. Corporate revenue was about 3 points higher than the September quarter with small and medium accounts which make up half of our corporate revenue, recovering five points faster in large corporates. While the passenger revenue environment remains challenging, we are encouraged that efforts to diversify our revenue streams have paid off. Our American Empress remuneration in 2020 was nearly $3 billion, down only 30% on a year-over-year basis. In fact, American Express has shared its spending on our co-branded card portfolio has performed in line to slightly better in their overall card portfolio spend in 2020. In the December quarter, MRO revenue was down almost 30% relative to the same period last year while cargo revenue was up 10% on year-over-year basis. This marks the first quarter of cargo revenue growth since the December 2018 quarter. Our December quarter results reflect the challenges that the pandemic has brought not just to Delta but to the entire airline industry. I am incredibly grateful for the efforts of the entire Delta team in managing through the challenging year that we faced. Now that we think about 2021, we see three distinct phases to the year. And for each phase, we have levers to help us react to the emerging demand environment. In the first phase, we expect demand shopping as to continue. The booking curve to remain more compressed and results to be similar to December quarter. In response, we are focused on making sure that our sellable capacity largely aligns with the emerging demand environment. For example, our January and February domestic schedule seats will be down 3 to 6% versus the non-holiday period in November. That will result in our March quarter sellable capacity being approximately 55% lower relative to the same period in 2019 consistent with the expected 60 to 65% revenue decline. We will also continue to leverage our non-ticket revenue streams like cargo, royalty, and MRO that we believe should continue to outperform passenger revenues. In the second phase, vaccination distribution continues, travel restriction and advisory begin to ease, and customer confidence begins to grow. As that happens, we expect to see an extension of booking curve resulting in a cash-led recovery with revenue recovery to follow. We anticipate this will happen in the spring and will result in us achieving our cash burn breakeven targets. In response to the second phase, our middle seats will be a very powerful tool for us, one we can use to add capacity in a very cost-efficient way generating a meaningful margin tailwind. In the final phase, vaccinations become more widespread and offices begin to reopen. We expect that to occur in the second half of '21. And as a result -- and result in a sustained improvement in demand with progression in cash generation as the booking curve normalizes. With the recovery initially fueled by leisure demand, Delta's success will be driven by our superior connecting economics through our core hubs domestically and our partner hubs internationally. The 34 new aircraft deliveries this year will also leverage high gauge and more efficient aircraft that produce lower seat cost, more premium seats, and a better customer experience. This will allow us to capitalize on our brand affinity and upsell opportunities which are enabled by the elimination of change fees for U.S. customers and the redemption of e-credits. It will take longer for corporate demand to return, but we are encouraged by the results over a recent corporate survey. Our corporate accounts are telling us that they largely anticipate returning to their offices and travel in the June and September quarters. They are also telling us by the end of '21, half are expecting to return to 50%, to 100% of pre-COVID domestic travel, and up to 50% of pre-COVID international travel. To our corporate customers, our commitment to you remains unchanged. Delta is ready when you are. We will be ready to serve our corporate customers by leveraging the strongest domestic and international networks, rebuilding focus cities, and point-to-point flying based on customer needs and by capitalizing on our efforts to always put the customer experience at the center of what we do. We're optimistic for the future, having built the right foundation and focusing on what we can control. We are confident in our ability to successfully navigate the post-pandemic recovery. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gary. Gary Chase : Thanks, Glenn, and good morning everyone. Let me touch on the fourth quarter in 2020, and then I'll turn to the outlook for costs in the balance sheet as we head into '21. Our December quarter pre-tax loss of $2.1 billion is about $500 million better than the September quarter, given the revenue improvement Glen just discussed combined with strong cost discipline. We reduced costs by approximately 50% from 2019 levels for the third consecutive quarter. More importantly, our costs were up just 6% from the third quarter on 30% capacity growth. And three quarters of that increase came from higher fuel. Total unit cost including fuel was down 4.5%, compared to 2019 on 44% lower flow and capacity. Our average daily cash burn for the December quarter was $12 million, half of the third quarters 24. We closed the year with $16.7 billion in liquidity and adjusted net debt of $18.8 billion up about $8 billion versus year-end 2019. Now, as we look into the year ahead, improving demand fundamentals will underpin a transition of our financial focus from protecting our liquidity, to positioning the company for a return to profitability and free cash flow. I will explain our approach to costs on our balance sheet as we make this transition. Let's start with costs. We need to stay flexible and maintain our discipline in order to position the company for the return to profitability Ed mentioned, as we expect continued choppiness and demand in the early part of the year. We've already taken structural steps to resize our business. Our two largest cost drivers, fleet and headcount are both 15% to 20% smaller than they were in 2019. Headcount reductions were a difficult, but necessary decision. It was hard to see 18,000 talented and dedicated co-workers leave, but it's a testament to the Delta culture that these reductions were achieved entirely through voluntary means. We accelerated our fleet transformation by retiring aircraft with relatively short remaining lives and simplified our fleet by eliminating two entire families while increasing our gauge, on a run rate basis, these changes will derive more than $400 million in annualized cost benefits. As we add capacity in '21, we will drive higher utilization of our system and we have room to rebuild our network from current levels at low incremental costs, approximately 40% to 50% of our December quarter non-fuel CASM. Our goal is to produce and sustain non-fuel unit costs below 2019 levels by the fourth quarter that cost focus will be a key driver of profitability later in the year when demand returns. Looking to the March quarter, we're preparing for stronger demand by reactivating aircraft and restoring our people to full hours, driving about $200 million in additional costs versus the December quarter. Our March quarter total operating expense will be 35% to 40% lower than March quarter '19 with a total unit cost including fuel down 5% to 10% on approximately 35% lower flown capacity. Let's move now to capital, the balance sheet and liquidity. As we begin the year, conditions are similar to where we exited 2020; a modest uplift in net sales should offset the cost investments we're making in the quarter. And as a result, we expect average daily cash burn between $10 million and $15 million similar to the December quarter. With further improvements in net sales as customers gain confidence, we expect our cash burn cease this spring. With that goal in sight, we're turning our focus to how we will balance reinvesting in the business while reducing our debt levels. Given our expectations for cash flow in '21 and proceeds from the PSP extension, we expect our current adjusted net levels to be the high watermark for that important metric. For the full-year, we're expecting $2.5 billion in gross CapEx, significant reduction from the $4 billion to $5 billion that we were spending pre-COVID. We have $1.3 billion of aircraft purchase commitments for 34 new deliveries this year, which we have the option to fully finance, and about $1 billion in non aircraft CapEx. Including retirements, we expect our fleet count at the end of 2021 will be 15% smaller than at year-end '19, with total fleet declining from about 1,350 to about 1,130. An equal priority is to work on our balance sheet by reducing our liquidity and paying down debt. We have approximately $1.8 billion of debt maturities in '21, and $2.1 billion in '22. Our debt has an average interest rate of 4.6%, which will drive approximately $350 million in quarterly interest expense. However, we will begin reducing those expenses by paying down debt this year. We do not have mandatory pension contributions until 2025 under airline relief, but we expect to make at least $500 million in voluntary contributions this year. In terms of a quarter-end outlook, with about $3 billion in PSP support expected from the government the March quarter, we project ending the period with $18 billion to $19 billion in liquidity and adjusted net debt of approximately $18 billion. Let me close by saying this, the Delta difference has never been more important. And I'd like to thank the Delta team for delivering for each other and for our customers amid the industry's most challenging environment ever. Because of your dedication we will emerge from the crisis stronger and more resilient than ever. With that, turn the call back over the Jill to begin the Q&A. Jill Greer : Thanks, Gary. Cathy, we're ready for questions from the analysts, if you could give the instructions on how to get in the queue. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi Syth : Hey, good morning, everyone. I'm just kind of curious after the vaccine news that have you seen a change in booking behavior? And also, I know the testing requirement is probably positive longer-term for opening up international demand, but are you seeing travelers perhaps shifting to more domestic sun and sand destinations from international? Ed Bastian : Savi, the vaccine deployment still is very early, and we haven't really seen much in the form of changed behaviors. And we hear a lot anecdotally, but it's also one of the weakest travel periods of the year in the current month that we're in. We've not seen the booking curve start to expand. We certainly hope to see that as we get through the quarter, and vaccines continue to become more prevalent. Savi Syth : Makes sense. And I'd be curious just to follow-up on some of the kind of the changing dynamics here. I was wondering if you have any kind of preliminary thoughts on how maybe the American and JetBlue partnership might impact the northeast position. Ed Bastian : We're not going to comment on our competitors or speculate. We -- you know us well. You know we love competition, and I think competition makes you better. Savi Syth : All right. Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Next, we'll go to Jamie Baker of JPMorgan. Jamie Baker : Hey, good morning, everybody. First question, for Glen, sort of a follow-up I suppose on Savi's question. In normal times what percentage of international revenue is made up of trips that last fewer than four or five days? I'm asking because I would think a trip of that duration would be particularly jeopardized by the need to land, and almost immediately take a COVID test so that you could come home? Glen Hauenstein : Well, I think that's dependent on how far customers are traveling. Generally, the longer they travel the longer the stay is. So, I think what we are seeing is a very good response from the closer in Caribbean and Mexico resorts, where hotels are now going to be offering that as part of the package. And so while there may be some choppiness, as there has been through this whole environment. As we start adopting those testing procedures we think in a pretty short order here that customers will adapt. And to the extent that travel does shift from short-haul international back to domestic, we'll be ready to move the airplanes back too. Ed Bastian : And, Jamie, I'd like to add to Glen\u2019s comment. We're still working obviously with the CDC. We endorse and support the testing requirements they've put in place. But a new feature is the inclusion of rapid testing into the mix, so it doesn't necessarily mean it only has to be a PCR test. And with the growth of antigen testing, the quality of antigen testing that's out there and the supplies in place you literally could get some of these tests done within a 10-minute interval shortly before you return. Jamie Baker : Excellent. Thank you for that, gentlemen. And a question for Gary, how are you thinking about the optimum level of liquidity to carry in the future, sort of a post-pandemic question. And if you haven't reached that conclusion yet is that because it's just not a priority right now or do you simply need to wait and see how the recovery plays out before reaching a decision? Gary Chase : Jamie, I think what I would say is it's obviously less than today. We need some time. We have I think some work in front of us to think through where we ultimately want that to be. But I think the important point is we're getting started, and I think you see some of that. During the quarter, we prepaid our term loan that was -- matured in April, for about $3 billion. We mentioned during the script that we do plan to make a pension contribution which, as you know, we consider part of our financial obligation. So we are getting started. We don't have more specifics, but we are getting started. And we're very focused on that $350 million number that I described, and using the liquidity that we have, where it makes sense to drive that down. Jamie Baker : And just a fine point on PSP, a simple yes or no question, have the terms been achieved, and if so are they the same as the first round? Thanks. Peter Carter : Yes, Jamie, it's Peter Carter. The terms are identical to the PSP 1. Jamie Baker : Perfect. Peter Carter : We've already signed the agreements with the government. Jamie Baker : Thank you, everybody. Take care. Ed Bastian : Okay, thanks, Jamie. Operator : Our next question will come from Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : Good morning. Ed, I thought a year ago we talked on this call about intentionally running lower load factors, and it's happening, but in a weird way. But you're getting paid for it, and your NPS scores are, as you mentioned, at an all-time high. So, unblocking middle seats is obviously a tactical choice, but even when you unblock them you don't have to sell them. So, I guess the question is, longer-term how are you thinking about running less full airplanes as an opportunity to differentiate yourself with that premium traveler? Ed Bastian : Yes, Hunter, it is an interesting year, I'll say that. We've not made a decision beyond the end of March relative to our -- when to unblock the middle seats, but we have some time to continue to look at that. I think it's going to be very much driven by customer demand, customer input, the confidence customers have in their seats. But no question about it, we are generating a meaningful premium due to that decision. Glen Hauenstein : Hunter, if I could have just a quick follow-up on that, is there -- I guess there are two ways, as we discussed last year, to do that. One is by creating more premium seats, and the other is by running lower load factors. As we go through this fleet transition where premium seats as a percent of our total seats continue to rise, and I think that's our primary way to satisfy the demand for premium customers is to continue to provide them with a higher level of quality. Hunter Keay : Got it. Yes, thank you, Glen. And then on the 18,000 early outs there or can you achieve 2019 capacity without backfilling any of those positions? Ed Bastian : Could you speak louder, we missed your question -- the start of your question, Hunter? Or I did. Hunter Keay : Sorry, about that, Ed. That's cool. The 18,000 early outs, that the question is like how much of -- can you achieve 2019 capacity levels without backfilling the majority or the entirety of those positions? Ed Bastian : We can't achieve 2019 levels without [of course] [ph] 20% of our people, no question about it. But there is that we don't need to backfill it entirely either. So there's a middle ground there. Hunter Keay : Okay. And then just one more quick one since we have 90 minutes, just -- it's a follow-up on Jamie's follow-up. Have you -- Peter, have you negotiated the new strike prices for the ones attached to PSP 2? Peter Carter : We have, and it's $39 and some change. Hunter Keay : Thank you. Operator : And now we will go to Andrew Didora of Bank of America. Andrew Didora : Hi, good morning, everyone. Glen, my first question is for you, kind of little tough to answer. But just curious about how you are thinking about the kind of the tradeoff between loads and load factor as you move through kind of the different phases of the recovery that you talk to, as I think as those travel restrictions ease, do you see -- can you stimulate more demand with price or do you think there is enough pent up demand in the network that now load factor [indiscernible] driver, just curious how you're thinking about that? Glen Hauenstein : I think we're taking a yield bias as we go into the peak summer, hoping that demand exceeds supply. And if that doesn't materialize we can make those adjustments later. But we have anticipated that there will be a nice recovery in demand as we get towards the summer, and we've taken a conservative approach. I hope that answers your question. Andrew Didora : And certainly helps a bit. And then, Ed, I know Gary gave some information about CapEx this year. But how are you thinking about that over the next few years, especially in light with your [indiscernible] to de-lever here. And what do you need to see in order to feel more comfortable in placing new aircraft orders? Thank you. Ed Bastian : Well, Andrew, I think we're a little early yet in terms of thinking about the long-term CapEx fixture thinking that we move $5 billion of aircraft CapEx alone over there to Airbus out over the next several years. You know, to a degree to which we want to take positions and new positions coming up, we'll continue to evaluate that based on demand. But right now, I feel pretty comfortable with where we sit. Andrew Didora : Okay, thank you. Operator : And now we'll go to Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Brandon Oglenski : Great. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking the questions. Gary, can you talk about some of the structural things that you've taken out of the cost structure? Can you reach that CASM target by the end of the year? And I think you made a comment about incrementally like 40% to 50% of your fourth quarter CASM there'd be variable event, if I hear it right. Gary Chase : Yes, Brandon, let me start with the first question, that the structural costs, the two biggest ones in our business are really headcount and fleet, as we mentioned. The fleet really determines an awful lot of the infrastructure that we need from a cost standpoint. We expect to get leverage out of all of our costs associated with assets, we look about a third of our cost structure on a monthly basis is fixed. So as we grow we'll obviously get leverage there. And we have pockets of opportunity in terms of better utilization of just the overall system. When I think about what we're doing here, and this gets to your second question, there are kind of two big things that I talk about or that we all talk about internally as we think about this effort that we're embarking on. The first is baseline aggressively, and it's -- really have a laser focus on what's in the cost structure now, and what makes sense. You see that in the 50% reductions that we've been posting now for several quarters. The second thing we say is leverage the build, and that's really where the incremental thought process comes. That's about being very thoughtful about better leveraging the system as we start to rebuild. Now I think in terms of your second question, incremental costs, it's pretty simple the way we're thinking about it. It's just change in cost divided by change in ASM. And we wanted to give some guidepost as to the leverage that we do expect going forward for the 40% to 50% of December capacity comes in. I'll just note, if you take a look at the second-half of 2020, it was quite a bit better than that. And that is why I emphasized that comment in the prepared remarks about how we scale the system, particularly in the fourth quarter. Brandon Oglenski : Okay. Thank you. I think those were my few. Operator : Our next question will come from Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Morning, everyone. A couple of questions on business travel. You said that small and medium-sized corporates are coming back first. Are you surprised by that? And is that good news or bad news for, when the bigger guys come back when the world opens up again? Ed Bastian : Robin, we're not surprised by that. These are small business owners who need to get out to their customers who have to work hard every single day to keep their sales and their business moving. And we do see a meaningful continued improvement in small business traffic, some that we can measure, others that we can't say, they're not under contracts with us, but we know that consuming important part of overall business travel. But I do want to talk about the overall corporate travel results. As you probably know, we extensively survey our corporate customers, our large corporate customers on a quarterly basis, in addition to just being with them on a weekly basis as to their thoughts on the return of travel. And the most recent survey that we conducted, which just ended a couple of weeks ago, indicated that 40% of our big corporate customers expect they will be fully back to 2019 levels by 2022. And another 11% said that they expect to be fully back by 2023. So that's little over 50% of the customers and these are the people everyone's speculating what's going to happen to business travel, these are the customers who make those decisions, 7% said we'll never be back to 2019 levels, only 7%. And 42% said they weren't sure needed more time to figure it out. So with all the dialog and speculation around the depth of business travel, just looking at that survey, it's very interesting. If you take the 51%, that said they'll be fully backed by '23, the majority of which is in '22. And then you consider the second quadrant of 50%, who said they'll never return or they're not sure of their return. And even if you assumed only 50% of their travel returns; that gets you 75% of the way back no later than '23, and I think that's a very pessimistic view on business travel. So what we've been talking about corporate travel, business travel returning, I felt optimistic when I saw those results, we know it's going to be different going forward. As I've said many times, it could be 10% to 20%, lower over a period as it's substituted and complemented, there'll be different types of travelers, different reasons for people traveling. But I think business travel has got a very, very strong opportunity return over the next two years, and we're going to be well positioned to carry. Ravi Shanker : That is great color on the demand side of business travel. Thank you for that. If I can just follow-up with the question on the supply side, clearly you guys are leaders from a corporate travel standpoint, but we have seen some of your LCC competitors, start to maybe find make some inroads as that traffic comes back. So maybe can you give us more color on kind of how you maintain that leadership and how you see the competitive environment looking like for business travel, when that does come back? Ed Bastian : I think that the Delta difference has never been more pronounced than it is right now. And if you look at our share of corporate travel that is traveling, we have experienced the highest levels in our history. So, demand for our products and services is incredibly high for people who want it. And I think that's where our challenge remains is to continue to provide industry leading products and services that our corporate travelers want and need. And that's been what we've been doing over the past several years. And what we'll continue to do as we get to the end of this pandemic, and I think that's going to be what differentiates us. And clearly, there's always people who would like to take that travel away from you, because it is some of the highest yielding travel in the system. But I think that's our goal. And our mission is to stay ahead of that and provide it to people who want to fly Delta. And as opposed to a push, which is, \"Hey, we can lower fares and triumphs, move to all the sides for the bottom of this.\" Ravi Shanker : Very good. Thank you. Operator : And now our next question will come from Catherine O'Brien, Goldman Sachs. Catherine O'Brien: Good morning, everyone. Thank you so much for the time. So my first question is actually about your products earlier about seeing a cash recovery before revenue recovery. And to try and square that with this 65% of your ATL is vouchers. As a really early perspective, bookings are coming until later in the year, are these majority new bookings or maybe there's a higher percentage of those vouchers that are corporate and you expect that early part of it probably be leisure, I would just want some color on that comment? Thank you. Ed Bastian : Yes, Katie, some of that came through a little garbled, let me say this, I think the distinction is really about timing, in the Spring, what we expect and I mentioned it a few times, we think as confidence starts to build, what you'll see is that people will start booking for further out in the booking curve, and so we will have a build in our air traffic liability, that helps us cross cash breakeven, earlier in the Spring, P&L breakeven is something that will take a little bit more, that's when you know, our revenue is going to be covering our expenses. And that is something that we expect will lag a little bit behind the building bookings. And we'll be there by the summer, as we've mentioned. Catherine O'Brien: Maybe just a little bit on our redemptions for the E-credit suites, we're running in the low to mid teens right now in terms of total revenues, with the E-credits coming back, and we expect that to stay below 20 as we move through this next period here. Ed Bastian : And that number has been pretty consistent throughout the entire year. So we have a pretty good sense of what that's going to look like. Catherine O'Brien: Okay, understood. And can you guys hear me a little bit better now? Ed Bastian : Yes. Catherine O'Brien: Okay, great, understood. And I know you guys have one of the furthest out periods through which people are doing, so that that makes sense. Maybe one of the cost structure of course, the pandemic has created a lot of pain for the industry. But I don't want to glaze over that. But, outside of speeding up your fleet simplification, have you found other opportunities to make the operation more efficient, perhaps maybe speeding up some of your automation plans in the customer facing side, wanted to share about other opportunities maybe born out of crisis? Thank you very much. Gary Chase : We have Katie, I'm not sure we're going to get into some of the specifics. I will say that the fleet simplification has been something actually, that we think is in our run rate. Today, you're seeing some of the benefit in the fourth quarter. But it is something that will have a much bigger impact as we move to rescale the network through '21. When I mentioned the concept of leveraging the build and maybe one of the reasons why I'm thinking through it, just as I'm thinking through it is there are a lot of things that we want to think about doing differently. One of the unique opportunities, we always want to make something good out of what has transpired. And it does give us an opportunity to start fresh. One of the reasons I think we're showing the kind of leverage as we rebuild is because we have a clean sheet of paper in some sense to start from. Ed Bastian : I'd like to add to Gary's comments, I think it's remarkable, the work the team has done on the cost side to get out in the fourth quarter to the point where our all-in unit costs are 4.5% lower quarter-over-quarter despite having over 40% less capacity to work with. It speaks to the ingenuity of the team, rethinking as we speak, what not just the current environment, but the future environment is and these are not costs that we're deferring out into the future. We're making real changes, real time here. And it touches every part of our business. So it's been one of the, since the demand has been low, we've been all over costs the entire year, and the team has done really, really good, good working. Catherine O'Brien: Yes, definitely fantastic staff, they're able to tell it earlier. Well, thank you all for the time. Ed Bastian : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey, thanks. Good morning. You covered this in pieces in a follow-up to a couple of other analysts. But one of the things that Delta has been talking about during this crisis was, which makes a lot of sense is, getting to 2019 CASM on a capacity footprint that's smaller. So I wonder if you'd kind of quantify, how much smaller a footprint can Delta still deliver 2019 CASM and is the thinking or the logic and the focus really more on CASM recovery and margin recovery before necessarily capacity recovery. Ed Bastian : Why not? I'll take that. Listen, they're all interrelated. You need to put the revenue and the capacity out there and remind the demand of the CASM strategy, but they're certainly connected to the ability to drive costs down. But one of the things that we have been a leader for many, many years, really the last decade is on our up-gaging strategy, domestic particularly, and that will continue to be important as we move forward and while we talk about simple flying to fleet, we've taken some big steps in that direction. We're also going to be advancing the up-gaging of the domestic fleet at the same time. So that's a big contributor. We'll continue to be a contributor with both driving down costs as well as improving the customer experience in revenue including premium revenue opportunities. I said in my remarks that our goal is to get that 2019 unit cost by the end of this year on roughly 75% of 2019 capacity level. We're in this pretty good market. We hope our capacity level is higher. I'll be honest that the demand environment is driving, but that's going to be driven by demand, not by cost. Duane Pfennigwerth : That's very helpful. And then maybe just broad brushstroke, you gave us the 75% by year-end. Is that how we should be thinking about your view of exit rate, and how are you thinking again, it can change, but how are you thinking about the summer as a percent of 2019? Ed Bastian : No, we're not using that as a guide for capacity levels. We're using that for our own internal calculus in terms of where we need to get our cost structure down. It won't be 75% and maybe higher, and may be lower. I don't know. There is a long way to go between here and there, and we'll keep you posted as we go. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay. And then just last one, maybe a question from a different era, but could you walk us through the comps on revenue monthly, because it seems like your guidance foots well, January, February similar to kind of 4Q levels, but March, it seems like there is a wide range of outcomes on March and obviously the comps fall off materially middle of March. So I don't know if you have the data handy, but how much easier is March and April relative to kind of Jan fab? Ed Bastian : Duane, we're not going back to get in monthly revenue guide, so I'm starting to have to pass. Duane Pfennigwerth : Fair enough. The comps do get easier. Thanks for taking the questions. Ed Bastian : Right, comps will give you -- it will be easier. Operator : And now we will go to you Joseph DeNardi of Stifel. Joseph DeNardi : Hi, thanks, good morning. Ed, you talked about the corporate travel environment in a scenario where corporate traffic is impaired 15% to 20%. What does that mean for your earnings power, and why shouldn't we be concerned that I guess that the fleet strategy is adding more premium seats into a declining premium market? Ed Bastian : Joe, I wouldn't draw the conclusion that corporate travel is impaired at all. In fact, I've not said that, I think we may see lower corporate travel, but I also think it will be changed essentially a different mix. So I don't think we should be for either ringing alarm bells relative to the future of corporate travel. All indications is corporate travel is ready to start coming back and we'll come back pretty aggressively beginning the second half of this year. We are a smaller airline, was there 200 fewer planes today, we've already right-sized the business to be smaller, which will help protect the premium revenue sources and the margins of the business. And well, that's why we spent a lot of time on this call talking about our cost performance that's going to be the key to make sure that we protect the margins in an environment where corporate travel will be down for the foreseeable future. Maybe it's permanently down by a little bit of lower amount that I'm not ready to declare that call yet. Glen Hauenstein : Could I add something to that? I think when you think about our premium products and services, you also ought to think that these are not only filled by corporate travelers. So as a matter of fact only less than a third of the seats are actually filled by the corporate travelers, and two-thirds are filled by non-corporates, and I think it's our ability to provide the right products and services for the non-corporates as well with the right sell up opportunities, so that we can match their preferences to our products and services. And I think that's really been one of the great hallmarks of the transformation is to say this is really available to everybody at reasonable prices. And that's been one of our key successes I think. Joseph DeNardi : Got it. That makes sense. Ed, it's my understanding that the owners of your SkyMiles are getting access to quarterly updated financial disclosures for SkyMiles similar to those you provided when you marketed the transaction. It's my understanding that equity investors are not. So my question for you is how is that fair? How do you expect your equity investors to make a fully informed decision on your stuff if they're not being provided with updated disclosures for what you guys have proven is your most valuable asset? Thank you. Ed Bastian : Joe, I'll let Gary take that because he was closer to the financial disclosure as well say. Well, the law department is a very important asset, our most important asset are people, Gary? Gary Chase : Yes. Joe, we too, we are providing some disclosures to those debt holders as you described. I think we agree with some of the sentiments that you have expressed over time. We see the value there. I think Glen did a good job of articulating how well it is holding up. We've been on a path to provide more information there. I think you'll have to be a little forgiving. We've had a lot on our mind and I think you can expect us to continue down that path for the reason, for the very same reason that I think you'd been asking about it, uh, because we do see the value there. Joseph DeNardi : Thank you. Operator : And now we will go to Greg Konrad of Jefferies. Greg Konrad : Good morning and thank you. Just to follow-up on some of the past questions. I mean, I guess in terms of the competitive environment, your yields have held up relatively well, only down 2% or 3% on a relatively short booking curve with reduced corporate travel. I mean, how do you think about that potential trajectory for yield as you -- the booking curve normalizes and some of the corporate travel returns? I mean, is there opportunity to kind of be above where you were in 2019? Ed Bastian : Well, I think there is always opportunity to be above where we were in 2019. That's clearly our goal, if it could be your short-term goal would be better. I think it's more medium to a long-term goal, but I think we are going to come out with a higher preference than we've ever had and that higher preference it will drive a higher demand. So -- which should enable us to work on yields as we come out the back end of this, so I think it goes back to how did people react to the pandemic and how to Delta's brand come through to us, and I think from all the research we've done from all the data that we see that our brand has never been stronger and demand for our products and services has never been stronger on a relative basis. And we're planning on capitalizing on that on the back end of this. Greg Konrad : Thank you. And then just one quick follow-up, just a cleanup question, I mean, how should we think about a refinery sales for the year or any change versus what you saw in Q4? Ed Bastian : Are you referring to the third party sales is that what you are asking? Greg Konrad : Yes, sorry, third-party. Ed Bastian : The phenomenon that you're seeing in the third party sales is anything we produce and do not exchange for jet fuel. We sell to third parties, obviously with our jet consumption being weighed down, we've had a lot more of those sales to third parties. So that is going to likely trend with how we rebuild our network and how much jet fuel were consuming. I do think it's important to point out that those sales have no margin. If you look in some of the reconciliations in the back of the release, you'll see that those are offset dollar for dollar rather on the cost side. So they're all wrapped into the economics of the refinery, but you should expect those to start trending down as our consumption picks back up and we're exchanging more for our own use. Greg Konrad : Thank you. Operator : And next we will go to Mike Linenberg of Deutsche Bank. Mike Linenberg : Hi, good morning everyone. I would like to just go back on the mandatory COVID test for international arrivals. Are you aware of any potential carve-outs like for those 24-48 hour roundtrips? And if you would have a vaccine to be vaccinated, would you be precluded from having to provide that test on entry? Ed Bastian : Hey, Mike. It's Ed. We are still working through the guidance from the CDC. While we have mentioned - I've personally have had a number of conversations with Dr. Wakefield around this. We've mentioned the need to consider some waivers in unusual circumstances where, for example, COVID testing resources are not available, or if they are some relatively short term as you mentioned air travel. So, we are working through the implementation details. I think it's absolutely right thing to do for the long term for our industry. But, it's going to create some short-term hiccups. Mike Linenberg : Okay, great. And then, just a question to Glen and if possible, Peter Carter, I know that you had sort of deferred on check all American, what I am more interested is that it looks like as part of that transaction, it does look like that there's going to be a slot divestiture. And that would obviously be at airports that are near and dear to Delta. Are those slots that -- from what you know are those slots that only new entrants can bid on, or are those slots that all carriers can bid on? And if that's the case, is that something that would interest Delta? Thank you. Peter Carter : So, the DOT has not made it clear what the rules are with respect to those slots, and I think it's suffice to say that we are deserving a DTA without question because of our market position. Mike Linenberg : Very good. Thank you. Operator : And now, we will go to David Vernon of Bernstein. David Vernon : Hi, good morning. So, Ed or Gary, could you talk to how as we move through these actual savings, how and when discretionary cost may come back in the system? I am wondering if there is going to be a need to prime the pump a little bit on the cost side to prepare for what should be a pretty steep recovery as vaccination rollout. Ed Bastian : Well, there will be some, David. We expect, for example, to have reactivation expenses around maintenance in aircraft through the remainder of the year. So, we expect that pace to continue. I am not sure I quite heard the non -- was it discretionary or non-discretionary expenses that you were asking? David Vernon : I imagine you guys have curtailed a lot of discretionary expense, so there is marketing, right, new development or systems work, or training programs what have you. I am just wondering if there is going to be need to step up that spend ahead of recovery here in the intervening months? Ed Bastian : Well, I prefer to think of it not to pick it up before recovery. But, we will have a need to revisit some of the things that we've done. If you take a look, David, at what we are pointing to in terms of incremental cost as we leverage the network, it does look different than what we saw in the second half of 2020. And one of the reasons is we do expect to have pressure in pockets. We have to be very mindful and balanced on those needs virtual realities of the business because we are determined here to turn the profit equation around and to be printing these releases with black ink this year. Glen Hauenstein : Hey, David, this is Glen. Let me expand on that just a bit. We are -- leveraged maintenance expenses. We have got our staffing levels back to where we need to be starting the 1st of this year. We were still to pay in terms of some of the pay cuts -- the voluntary pay cuts that our employees took last year. So, there is a meaningful step up already in the numbers we gave you for the cash burn in the first quarter to get ready for the recovery. So, I am very comfortable with where we sit. In fact, if we wanted to continue to run the same cost structure and forego some of those expenses, you would see our cash burn coming down in a relatively meaningful level in the first quarter as well. But, we have maintained the same level of cash burn to get ready for the spring. David Vernon : That's helpful. And then maybe just as a follow-up, you noted in the release the amount of CapEx that's come out of the budget over the next couple of years. I'm wondering if there's been a discussion at the board level about goal posts or guideposts for profitability before we kind of go back to renewing the fleet in earnest? Ed Bastian : David, again, I think that question is a little premature. Yes, we talked about that topic of the board. We also haven't made any determinations quite yet. The goal we have at the board is very much what we said to you, is that we get to a goal is to get to a cash breakeven position for the second quarter and return to profitability starting in the third quarter. The pace of that recovery over the next couple of years, obviously, we still have some work to do there. David Vernon : Okay, thanks. Jill Greer : Cathy, we're going to have time for one more question from the analysts, if you can see that. Operator : Certainly, and that question will come from Joe Caiado of Credit Suisse. Joe Caiado : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time, Ed, Glen just a quick clarification question regarding your annual corporate travel survey, 40% percent of respondents say fully recovered by 2022. Are they referring to their businesses being fully recovered by 2022, or their corporate travel budgets being fully recovered by then? Or do they see everyone in the same? Ed Bastian : Yes, corporate travel being back. Joe Caiado : Got it, okay. Understood, it's helpful. And my second question, just it's clear that you're not seeing any elongation of the booking curve yet at this stage. But what about clicks or looks, stopping short of actual bookings? But is there any data like that, that you're tracking analytics on the Web site, something like that, that provide the basis for your recovery outlook on Q1 and sort of saying that you have a good shot of P&L break even in Q3? Or you just, hopeful that that's going to be the case? Are there any analytics that you can share with us, that maybe give you a better indication, thank you for the time. Ed Bastian : Absolutely corporate, looks are actually doing quite well were 40% up quarter-over-quarter where we were last quarter in terms of looks, and look to book is very low. So people are looking, they're aspiring to travel. And they're just not ready to commit yet. And I think that's what really gives us that sense that there will be a time in which people feel comfortable again to travel. And that will turn into a click, turn into a booking. And so we're monitoring that very, very carefully. And we're looking forward to the opportunity to serve these customers as they come back. Joe Caiado : Thanks for that color. Operator : That's going to wrap-up the analyst's portion of the call. I will turn it over to Tim Mapes, our Chief Marketing and Communications Officer. Tim Mapes : Well, good morning, everybody. I want to thank all the members of the media who have gathered on the call today, your interest in Delta is not only appreciated, it's never been greater. And we're very pleased today to provide you with an expanded period of time to make sure that we address your questions. I'd also like to thank Ed and Glen and the members of the Delta Leadership Committee, all of whom are on this call for their involvement as we turn the Page on 2020 and optimistically look at 2021. So, Cathy, if you could please review the instructions and mention to everyone how they go about asking a question? Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Alison Sider of the Wall Street Journal. Alison Sider : I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the operational issues we saw around the holidays, Thanksgiving and Christmas. And what looking back and think were kind of the root causes of that. And, what if any changes you've made prevent the same sort of thing from happening again? Ed Bastian : Sure, Ali, we certainly had a much better Christmas holiday than the Thanksgiving break. There were a number of factors going on in the staffing levels of the company with a lot of changes that we had implemented. And you couple that with COVID and some of the exposures into everyone seeing the No Fly capability to some of our staffing, which came in. We learned from that for Thanksgiving. We made some pretty aggressive changes in December in terms of getting the schedule fine tuned to anticipate that. And we were really, really good shape. And then we got hit with a massive storm in Minneapolis on the 23rd of December, which cost us probably a couple of 100 cancels, incremental cancels over that next couple of day timeframe which was concerning, but unavoidable unfortunately. The most important thing in all of that is one the Delta people. And I know there were some bloggers out there wondering whether the Delta pilots weren't doing everything, the Delta pilots were amazing through the full holiday periods and showing up and getting the flights going and giving up their holidays and their time away with the families to help the company out. So it had nothing to do with pilot staffing at all. The other thing was the number of customers who may have been canceled, while which is higher than we've been expecting, the vast majority of the people back to their destination, within hours of their looking to time. So, the teams did very, very good job and that issue was pretty much over by the 26, 27. Gary Chase : And that really manifests itself in the record Net Promoter Score we had in the December time period. So as I mentioned, despite the fact that we had to cancel some flights, our average lateness was not very late versus the original itinerary. And our customers over the holiday period were quite satisfied posting record high Net Promoter scores. Alison Sider : And just a follow-up, is there anything you can share about what you're seeing in terms of crew member infections at this point, I know that the pilots have said they saw some big increases in COVID infections in a late fall, I'm just wondering if you're still seeing that or if that's sort of been brought under control? Ed Bastian : Well, we're a microcosm of the country and as the pandemic has accelerated over the course of the last few months in order to accelerate across airline employees as well. But our team's doing real job, they're not seeing it spread within the company, when they're at work, it's in community is where people are getting sick. So I tell you, every work category of the company is experiencing an increase in exposures as we're all exceeding over the last couple of months. Alison Sider : Thank you. Operator : And now we will go to Tracy Rucinski of Reuters. Tracy Rucinski : Hi, good morning. I'm wondering if you think we'll see COVID-19 testing and being required for domestic flights? Ed Bastian : Tracy, I don't think so. Tracy Rucinski : Okay. And just to follow-up with a separate question, should we expect to see a deal with Boeing this year for a 737 MAX order? Gary Chase : We're not going to speculate on that. Tracy Rucinski : Okay, thank you. Gary Chase : Sorry. Operator : Now we'll go to Claire Bushey of Financial Times. Claire Bushey : Hi, I know Delta has been growing its own list of people who are not able to fly in the airline, but I was wondering if the company had any visibility into whether more names are being added to that Federal No Fly list, based on last week's Capitol attacks? Gary Chase : Sorry, your last part was real garble. Your question, are we adding increased numbers to our No Fly lists based on Federal information? Claire Bushey : I was asking whether Delta knows if names are being added to the Federal No Fly list based on the Capitol attacks. Gary Chase : We certainly know that the TSA is looking very carefully at those that were in the Capitol building the writers and we're working closely with them and I do anticipate if the TSA is able to identify individuals who have people added to the No Fly List, no question about it. Claire Bushey : Thank you. Operator : And next we have Leslie Josephs of CNBC. Leslie Josephs : Hi, good morning, everybody. You mentioned that there was a lot of pent-up demand and also the hoarding of points from the Frequent Flyer Program. What happens if a lot of people try to redeem it once? Is that something that you're expecting based on Search data and other things? And then also you mentioned a recovery in the second half of the year, where are you seeing demand? Are those sorts of outdoor social distancing destinations showing more strength than another? But where's the demand coming from? Thanks. Ed Bastian : Well, clearly leisure destinations are at the forefront of the recovery right now. And I think it doesn't matter whether or not it's a beach or a mountain view. That's where people are headed at this point in the recovery. And then your second question was about\u2026 Leslie Josephs : So if you're reporting, what happens if everyone, I know you're foreseeing they will or trying to redeem? Ed Bastian : We're happy and really have are indifferent whether or not people who are booking are using points or whether or not they're using actual dollars, or whether they're using the E-credits, what we're anticipating is that all of those will increase. And we have plenty of capacity to meet that demand as we head to the second half of '21. So we're hoping that all of the above happens. Gary Chase : From talking to American Express, good partners there, it's clear that people place great value on their loyalty points with Delta and like to see the values grow over time. And so while they've been in the pandemic, we've seen redemptions down four points, because flying levels are down. But they haven't stopped spending on the card, our Co-brand card is as good if not better than almost any other product card, AmEx has. So it has great appeal. And we expect it's not going to be, not to be run on the bank type situation that you're referring to. Leslie Josephs : Okay, you could just adjust in words, the availability and things like that to write. Gary Chase : Absolutely. We're looking forward to that day. Leslie Josephs : Thank you. Operator : And now we will go to David Koenig of The Associated Press. David? David Koenig : Hi, real quick question. Unless I missed it, I have not heard an update in a while and the number of people you have banned for not wearing face masks. Is there a current figure on that? And any changes in cabin policies? Ed Bastian : I think that number is north of 800 at this point, David. David Koenig : Okay, very good. All right and then how many of those are since last week, you know? Ed Bastian : That number is not a huge number but a number. Operator : And now our question will come from Kelly Yamanouchi of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Kelly Yamanouchi : Hi there. I wanted to ask about profit sharing with no profit sharing next month from 2020 results. So I was wondering what impact you think that may have on employees and satisfaction? And also wondering if there's if you think there's a possibility of profit sharing a year from now? Ed Bastian : Well, I think everyone is aware why there's not profit sharing in this year. And I can tell you employee satisfaction is at a very, very high level. I mentioned during this trip, Kelly that we just were awarded as the Seventh best employer by Glassdoor. Glassdoor is an entirely employee driven acknowledgement, the company hasn't had any, any input or any insight into that. It's purely by employees talking about their employers. So if that gives you a sense for the sentiment, the sentiment is very strong. The volunteerism with the 10s of 1000s of people that have taken unpaid leaves of absence over the year indicates that, we've been mindful of the fact that there won't be a profit sharing payout. And we're providing added services and assistance around financial health and financial well being and credit counseling and other services to employees that may need it. We're going to be ramping. We have been ramping it up and talking about it. We're going to continue to talk about it on an ongoing basis going forward. We have people providing that support. And relative to next year's profit sharing, I certainly hope we'll be paying it, it's hard to speculate it now, it's just only a couple weeks into the year. But I'm hopeful that we'll be paying it. Kelly Yamanouchi : Great. I also heard mentioned during the call so far about the value of connecting economics, but also the importance of point to point in focus cities. I was wondering if you expect how you expect the Atlanta hubs role to be different going forward in terms of size or the role in your network. Ed Bastian : Well, clearly the size of Atlanta is relative to the size of demand in the United States. As the World's largest hub, it is a microcosm of global airline demand. So we expect it to recover as the airline continues to recover, the two things that I would say is that we're going to continue to work on average gage, which I think is something that's really important and that will be bringing more details about bigger airplanes with better products and services. And so, I think you'll see the departures get back to 2019 levels at some point in the future. But before that, you'll probably see the employments start to rise dramatically and using really the gauge lever as much as the departure level. This is as you know, our most valuable asset here in Atlanta and we're very proud to be a part of the Atlanta community, and it has led us in the rebuild of our network so far. Kelly Yamanouchi : Great, thank you so much. Operator : Our next question will come from Ted Reed with Forbes. Ted Reed : Thank you for taking the questions. I have two questions for Glen. First one, Glen, when you said earlier, Delta is ready when you are talking about when you come back, where you talking about in terms of capacity or something else? Glen Hauenstein : I think that when customers are wanting to fly on Delta, we'll be ready for them. And I know you've heard a long time and I know you remember that slogan. So it's hearkening back to a little bit of history there with topic. Ted Reed : So you're just saying, you'll be ready though. You'll have the capacity suited to what you anticipate customers will want? Glen Hauenstein : Correct. Ted Reed : All right. Secondly, we've been talking a lot about the middle seats being empty and being up, you said a powerful tool. How are you measuring what the value, how can you tell that these are so valuable to your customers? Glen Hauenstein : Our revenue premiums have never been higher. And so customers are valuing the Delta difference. And I think that's how we're looking at that is when you look at our revenue production versus our competitive set despite having the least amount of syllable capacity, our revenues have kept pace. So I think we're seeing not only the highest share of corporate demand we've ever had, although albeit on depressed levels, but a real differentiator when customers are shopping for that apply jobs with some of our competitors. Ted Reed : And you think that due to middle seats being emptied longer and others? Glen Hauenstein : I think it's an entire Delta difference. Clearly that's a piece of it. But whether or not it's the Delta care standard, whether or not it's the Delta people, which are really at the heart of that. But this is one component of ensuring that Delta is seen as a brand you want to associate with. Ted Reed : All right. Thank you. I appreciate it. Operator : And now we'll go to Dawn Gilbertson, USA Today. Dawn Gilbertson : Hi, good morning. I also have questions on your middle seat policy, Ed and Glen I know you both said no decision has been made yet, but Glen, your comment about the second phase is the middle seats will be a very powerful tool. It sounds to me at least like you're certainly leaning towards unblocking them. A, is that a fair assumption. B, Can you talk to us about the timing of this decision when will you decide whether they are blocked beyond March 30th? Thank you. Ed Bastian : Dawn, as you said, no, I would not say that's a fair assumption. What we said is that when the demand returns, which is that next inflection point that will inform our decisions around what to do with the middle seat. So we've not made any decisions to unblock them post-March 30. Dawn Gilbertson : Can you give us a sense of when and when will you make that decision, because pretty still, I know the booking curve is still short, but you're kind of optimistic about summer. So will you make that decision in the next month, the next few weeks, a couple of months, can give us any sense of that please? Ed Bastian : Well, we continue to monitor it on a regular basis. It's not imminent. We have to have some bit of time, but it's going to be informed by customer sentiment, demand, in addition to message, we have a lot of other seats still on our planes, and confidence in travel relative to COVID and vaccine deployment. So, yes, it's not a clear line, and there is hope that has to go into that. We know that it has been important not the only, but one of the important reasons why Delta has been able to continue to earn an even higher revenue premium during this past year than we historically had. And so we want to be very careful as to how we make that decision. Dawn Gilbertson : Thank you very much. Operator : And now we will go to [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, yes. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the changes in the competitive environment, American JetBlue Alliance, the Northeast, and then how that -- how, I guess, you intend to respond to that? Ed Bastian : No. I think we're very confident in our products and services, and we compete well against both those carriers individually. And I'm sure we'll compete very well against them together. So we have a lot of confidence in our products and services in the Northeast. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then there's also been some expansion of some of your focus cities, Raleigh-Durham, Austin. This helps the plan to return there and [compete] [Ph] there as well? Ed Bastian : Focus cities will be an important part of our portfolio moving forward. And we'll continue to work on making sure that we have the great capacity in those cities as demand returns. And so we're looking forward to demand continuing to return in all of our focus cities. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : And now we will go to Robert Silk with Travel Weekly. Robert Silk : Well, thanks for taking my call. Simple question, do you see, has CDC given any indication? I know that A4A had called for -- wanted testing there on you all, wanted testing to be put in place, but in exchange a rollback of travel bans. Any indication if that could be -- coming? Ed Bastian : Your question, I'm sorry, was a big garble. Could you repeat that? We're having a hard time with some of our communications this morning. Robert Silk : Can you hear me a little better now? Ed Bastian : Yes. Robert Silk : Okay. So the question is if there's indication or sense from the federal government or CDC that with this blanket testing requirement that there could be a rollback of travel bans, which is something that the airlines has called for? And I'll also follow, another question is any sense that vaccines ultimately could be included in the mix, if you're vaccinated it relieves testing requirements, there could be an either/or? Ed Bastian : We're still working with the CDC on the specific testing strategy and deployment. This is something that we -- Delta endorse. I know our industry similarly endorses. We would like to see the travel restrictions lifted once the testing protocols are in place, and that will be a decision by the new administration, is my understanding, when they take office. And -- but I think by having the testing protocols in place it then gives confidence to the regulatory authorities to start to lift the bans, which is why we endorse the testing strategy. Your question relative to vaccines, yes, obviously once vaccines are at scale we would hope that the vaccination evidence would supplant the need to show a test result. But of course, we're still working with the authorities on that. Robert Silk : Okay, thanks. [Technical difficulty]\u2026 Tim Mapes : Cathy, we have time for one final question for the group, please. Operator : Certainly. And that will come from David Slotnick of Business Insider. David Slotnick : Hey, everyone, how are you? Thanks for the question. I was just wondering what the phases, the three phases that Glen outlined earlier. With that timing in mind and with the response you have gotten from the corporate travelers, is Delta still expecting a recovery to 2019 revenue travel levels in line with the rest of the industry with the, I think it was 2023 or 2024 with the IATA, and if you're able, previously forecasting or has that moved up pretty well? Ed Bastian : Again, I'm sorry; it's hard to hear the question. Let me take a shot at it. The information that we shared on the call about corporate travel is the sentiment we're getting from our own customers. As you are aware, we are the largest carrier of corporate travel amongst the U.S. carriers, so I think we have probably some of the best info, referred to IATA or any other group that, you know, I don't know how they determine what 2023 to 2024 looks like. I wouldn't take too much confidence in that. But what our corporate travel managers are telling us is that 50% expected to be fully back by 2023. The other 50% is largely uncertain, but we expect a meaningful amount of that travel to return as well. David Slotnick : Makes sense. So, does Delta have a forecast for when they'll return to 2019 travel levels? Ed Bastian : The numbers we're comparing are 2019 volumes, yes. David Slotnick : Okay, thanks. Tim Mapes : Thank you, David. With that we'll turn it over to Ed to make some final comments again. Thank you, everybody, for your time this morning. Ed Bastian : So, thanks, Tim. Just in closing, I think you can all appreciate that 2020 was a difficult year, but we're on a recovery path. We see that the start of it beginning to crystallize here, particularly with the vaccine development, and as you've heard earlier, when Glen and Gary, I'm confident that we've got the foundation in place to return Delta to revenue growth, profitability, and free cash flow generation. We're committed to keeping our culture intact and our employees engaged. We'll continue to listen to our customers and put them first in order to further enhance their experience on Delta, increase their loyalty, and drive affinity towards our brand. We're very focused on the innovations, which is allowing us not only to enhance the customer experience and drive efficiency, but also to tackle the big challenges that still lie ahead for us. We'll remain very focused on cost performance. We've talked a lot about that during the call, to ensure that leisure-led demand environment that emerges, we'll be able to respond to it. And finally, we're committed to reducing debt, strengthening our balance sheet and creating long-term shareholder value, and allowing our owners to participate in future upside without dilution. And we have the very best employees in the industry, and we're ready to see this strategy through, which gives me optimism, confidence in our ability to thrive and emerge as the industry leader. So, thanks again for joining us today. And we look forward to speaking with you soon. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation today.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma'am. Julie Stewart : Thank you, Travis. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for our March quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining us from Atlanta today are our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our Interim Co-CFO, Gary Chase. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta's performance and strategy, Glen will provide an update on the revenue environment, and Gary will discuss cost, fleet, and our balance sheet. Similar to last quarter's call, we scheduled today's call for 90 minutes to make sure we have plenty of time for questions. For analysts, we ask you please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up, so we can get to as many of you as possible. After the analyst's Q&A, we will move to our media questions, after which, Ed will provide a brief closing statement. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I'll turn the call to Ed. Ed Bastian : Thank you, Julie. It's been a little over a year since the onset of the pandemic and our customers are gaining confidence in air travel and beginning to reclaim their lives. Reflecting on what it's been in a year like no other, I'm tremendously proud of the progress that we've made and the agility that we've demonstrated. I developed an even deeper appreciation for Delta\u2019s strength, and firmly believe that the pandemic has served as a catalyst for us to find new and better ways to serve our customers and our communities. Thanks to the incredible dedication and sacrifices of our people, Delta has weathered the storm with our culture, our brand, and our values stronger than ever before. And I want to thank every member of the Delta family for your incredible efforts over the past year. Collectively, you've carried us through and shown that unique spirit that we call the Delta Difference. I also want to thank the administration and Congress for continued payroll support, which has protected thousands of airline jobs throughout the industry, and will help speed the U.S. economy in the recovery. Thanks to that support, we've been able to return our people to full work schedules, despite running an operation that will be at 65% to 70% of 2019 levels in the June quarter. The first quarter had two distinct periods, with the first half feeling very much like an extension of 2020. This demand was slower than expected. But as case counts decline and vaccinations accelerated demand picked up meaningfully later in the quarter, allowing us to achieve $4 million of daily positive cash generation in the month of March, the first positive cash generation since the onset of COVID-19. This marks a critical milestone in the path to restoring our financials. It is truly a great accomplishment, especially considering that our middle seat block limited the inventory that we're selling in business and international travel remain muted. It's also important to note that this metric takes into account all expenses that we're incurring as we rebuild our business. [Indiscernible] turned a true net positive cash flow position within a year of the biggest crisis ever seen in the history of this industry, is a real testament to the resilience of the company that we have built. Consumer confidence in air travel continues to increase with the pace of vaccinations in the U.S. rapidly accelerating, and predictions of herd immunity as soon as the summer. We said throughout the pandemic that one of the most important objectives was to restore confidence in air travel. We are now seeing more normal booking behavior as customers make plans for spring and summer travel. In fact, our daily net cash sales in March were twice what they were in January. As volumes grow, keeping our employees and customers safe and healthy will always be our top priority. We've taken a science-based approach to cleanliness, and are being guided by our own Chief Health Officer, Dr. Henry Ting, as well as by medical experts at the Mayo Clinic in Emory. And earlier this month, the CDC confirmed that it is safe to travel within the U.S. for those who have been fully vaccinated, an important step forward for the recovery of our industry. We are aligning with the recommendations of health professionals and government officials who continue to ensure the safe and effective distribution of vaccines and listening to our customers. Based on our survey work, 75% of our customers expect to be vaccinated by Memorial Day. With improving demand and vaccine trends, we announced that we'll start selling middle seats May the 1st, providing a powerful tool for improving our financial performance. We also launched other customer experience and loyalty enhancements to increase confidence in travel and maintain the trust and loyalty that we've built over the last 12 months. Looking ahead and assuming that these recovery trends holds, we expect to cut our pretax loss by more than half in the June quarter to between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, and we see a path to returning to profitability in the September quarter. Delta's resilience has helped us navigate the worst days of the pandemic driven by the competitive advantages that are core to our DNA. Those advantages our people, our brand and loyalty program, our reliable operations, our network, and our balance sheet will be even more important as we accelerate through the phases of recovery. These modes were tested like never before, and I'm proud of the resilience that they've demonstrated. Our people and our culture of service remain our most strategic asset. Loyalty to the Delta brand has never been stronger. Thanks to the outstanding service that our people provide. They are truly the best professionals in the business. This is evident in our domestic customer Net Promoter Scores, which have been in the low 70s throughout the pandemic, a full 20 point increase over 2019. We've also seen our customers continue to invest in the Delta brand using their American Express co-brand cards, demonstrating the resiliency of this unique revenue stream. Despite a large reduction in T&E categories, March co-brands spend on the card overall was up relative to March 2019 levels. Our operational performance remained strong. During the quarter we led the industry in all on-time metrics including A0, D0, and completion factor, which was more than 99%. And our network rebuild leverages the strength of our core hub structure in our international partner gateways. Same time, we are renewing and simplifying our fleet, improving the customer experience driving efficiency, and reducing emissions as we push toward our carbon neutral goals. And finally, the strength of our balance sheet enabled us to manage through the worst crisis in our history with no dilution to our shareholders other than warrants related to the Payroll Support Program, is something that continues to set us apart in the industry. We've begun our journey of de-levering, and by the end of the June quarter, we will have reduced financial obligations by nearly $10 billion through a combination of paying down debt and accelerating pension funding since last fall. This reflects an unprecedented turnaround in the health of our pensions over the last decade, securing the future of our retirees. Later this year, we expect to make one final contribution to the plan of up to $1 billion, which should enable our pension to reach fully funded PPA status by the end of this year, largely mitigating the need for any additional cash contributions going forward. And finally, as we look toward the future, it's important to acknowledge that the commitment we made last year to achieving carbon neutrality is as strong as ever. The only future for Delta and our industry is a sustainable future. This is why we're accelerating our fleet renewal and balancing near-term needs for verifiable offsets with long-term investments in sustainable aviation fuels, carbon sequestration advancements, and clean propulsion technology. And because we can't do this alone, we are collaborating with corporate customers as well as large energy producers in order to address aviation emissions together and work to scale up sustainable aviation fuels. We're excited about the progress that we're making to combat climate change, and enable a cleaner, more sustainable world. These steps are vital to Delta's long-term future, and we owe it to the next generation of customers and employees to continue down this path. The time for action not talk is now and I'm proud of the steps our team is taking. As the recovery takes hold, glimmers of hope are now optimism for the future. Demand for air travel is accelerating in a meaningful way and we are well-positioned to build a stronger Delta, as demand recovers to pre-pandemic levels in the next few years. With our competitive advantages having been fully tested, we have built the platform to extend Delta's leadership position in the years to come. More than ever, I am confident in the future of Delta and our people. Over the last year, we've taken meaningful actions to become a better, more sustainable, more inclusive company, driven by our mission to connect the world. And with that, I'll turn it over to Glen. Glen Hauenstein : Thanks Ed and good morning everyone. As Ed mentioned the pace of demand recovery accelerated over the course of the quarter. With growing confidence, customers are now buying tickets for travel further out speeding our cash recovery. In the month of March, daily new bookings improved 50% from the January and February average, well ahead of its normal seasonality. As customers are now buying tickets for travel further out, our booking curve has extended and our air traffic liability has grown for the first time in three quarters up more than 800 million from December. On our January call, I outlined three distinct phases to the year and our levers for each. To progress to the second phase, we need to see higher vaccination rates, easing travel advisories, and growing consumer confidence, all of which are now evident in the United States today. Approximately 50% of the adult population in the U.S. have never received at least one dose of the vaccine. And by May, all states will have lifted mandatory domestic quarantine restrictions. Pent-up demand is also evident with domestic leisure bookings 85% recovered to 2019 levels and Latin leisure markets more than fully restored. Beyond our own bookings, we see encouraging data points in the broader economy. This includes accumulated savings, restaurant dining, credit card spend, hotel occupancy rates, web search data on travel, and corporations announcing more concrete office reopening plans. In response to these developments and the reduction of COVID-19 cases, as well as accelerating vaccination rates, we will sunset our middle seat block as of May 1st. That provides us with a very powerful lever to add capacity in a cost efficient way and generate meaningful margin tailwind. Removing our middle seat block results in our sellable capacity increasing from 46% of 2019 levels for the month of April to 67% of 2019 levels for the month of June. And with this increase coinciding with strong customer demand for our product, we expect our passenger unit revenue to improve by 20 to 25 points over that period. With this added capacity and a continuation of the leisure recovery heading into peak season. We expect our June quarter revenues to improve by approximately $2 billion from the March quarter. The corporate travel recovery has been slow but steady. Corporate volumes in March were nearly 20% recovered, up from 15% at the end of 2020. Small and medium enterprises continue to outperform other corporates by about five points. And given our investments and the customer experience, we've been able to grow our domestic corporate share lead which is now significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. To progress to the next leg of the recovery, we need corporate travel to return in earnest. While we expect continued improvements to business travel through the summer, we anticipate the significant increases will occur after Labor Day as we enter the more traditional business travel season. That will happen as vaccinations become even more widespread and offices continue to reopen. We continue to expect operational and sales related traveled to lead with travel to large conferences and internal meetings likely the last recover. Our views on corporate demand recovery are consistent with what we've heard in our most recent quarterly corporate survey, where one-third of our accounts expect to increase travel volume in the June quarter, and a majority of our corporate customers expect to return to office in the second half of the year. Vaccine distribution and lifting of government travel restrictions remain the top two drivers of corporate willingness to travel. International travel remains muted with long haul international bookings volumes at only 15% to 25% recovered. We're seeing some early signs of life in Europe with Iceland opening to travel to vaccinated U.S. citizens and increased demand for Israel and leisure destinations this fall. That said Europe lags the U.S. and Pacific is expected to be the last region to recover. We do not anticipate meaningful international demand improvement until later in the year when borders reopen. Once the recovery of those segments are underway, we'll expect they also proved to be a powerful cash and profitability lever for our business. Considering our operating leverage improvements in those segments will be cost effective and highly margin accretive, a dynamic that is very similar to what we expect from lifting our middle seat blocks and one that I am very enthusiastic about. In the meantime, we'll continue to benefit from the strengthening demand environment in the domestic and short haul Latin regions and from our non-ticket revenue streams which have proven more resilient. Our cargo revenues in the March quarter improved 5% sequentially and we're up 12% versus the March quarter of 2019. The performance of our loyalty is indicative of Delta's strong brand affinity and our customer aspirations to return to travel. As Ed mentioned co-brand spin in the month of March was higher than 2019 levels. This was a result of solid growth in non-T&E spend and continued momentum in T&E, which is now down 35% in March from down approximately 55% in November -- in December I'm sorry. Card acquisitions are also rebounding nicely and our attrition rates are below pre-pandemic levels. For the Month of March, co-brand acquisitions were over 60% recovered with less than half of our customer base blind. Our long-term partnership with American Express combines two strong consumer brands enhancing customer loyalty, while also providing a high margin revenue stream that has proven its resiliency. We have driven stronger engagement through our digital channels resulting in more direct relationships with our customers and record high digital satisfaction scores. Over the last year, we've created a more flexible and enhanced experience for our direct channels, increasing self service and making it easier for our customers to do business with Delta. Digital adoption is on the rise and direct channels like delta.com and the Fly Delta app account for 66% of our sales in the March quarter, up 15 points from 2019. While we expect that will normalize especially as corporate travel recovers, direct channels will continue to be preferred, particularly among medallions and young customers. As we restore our business, we're rebuilding our industry leading network with a simpler, younger, and more fuel efficient fleet. At the same time, we have preserved optionality with levers to flex our capacity restoration in either direction depending on the shape of the recovery. We are also capitalizing on the industry's best domestic hub structure with the highest return profile. The combination of our strong core hubs and coastal positions provides us with the unique opportunity to leverage cost efficient gauge with large narrow body aircraft, providing meaningful efficiency and scale advantages. In addition, we now see the opportunity to significantly improve our international returns from pre-pandemic levels, driven by an improved competitive position, a stronger cargo business, the acceleration of our fleet renewal, stronger partnerships, and an improved product offering. Reflecting on what has been the most difficult 12 months in the company's history, I could not be prouder of what our teams have accomplished. So, I want to thank them for their commitment and continue to put the customer in the center of what we do every day Looking forward, I'm optimistic about Delta's bright future. We have a powerful brand loyalty program that's proven their resiliency; we continue to improve our customer experience both in the air and on the ground as we've accelerated our robust array of airport projects. Our focus on health and flexibility has won the confidence of our travelers and we're being well served by our younger, more eco-friendly fleet, and leaner cost structure. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary. Gary Chase : Thanks Glen. And good morning, everyone. I'm excited to see our recovery begin to take root and our focus shift from stabilizing the company's financials to creating value by returning to profitability, generating cash, and restoring our financial position to its pre-COVID strength. Let me start with some highlights from the quarter and I'll address the upcoming quarter our fleet strategy and the beginnings of our de-leveraging journey. Our first quarter pretax loss of $1.5 billion includes a $1.2 billion benefit related to the Payroll Support Program. Net of this benefit, restructuring items and extinguishment charges associated with the prepayment of debt reported an adjusted loss of 2.9 billion. Our people out in the operation along with the commercial and finance teams came together nicely to produce great cost performance. Adjusted operating costs of $6.3 billion were 33% lower than 2019. Slightly higher than we anticipated at the outset of the quarter was half due to higher fuel expense and the other half due to recovery and COVID-related items. Non-fuel CASM was up sequentially as expected on 10% higher capacity as we restored our employees to full work hours and incurred costs to prepare for the recovery. Adjusted fuel price of $1.91 per gallon was 33% higher than 4Q, driven by market prices and losses at the refinery, which drove a $0.23 per gallon headwind in the quarter. On the consumption side, we realized the 12% fuel efficiency gain compared to 2019 with nearly half of that a direct result of our fleet renewal. Daily cash burn averaged $11 million in the quarter, improving from $12 million in the December quarter despite stepped up expenses. Improved receipts in March drove $4 millions of daily and positive cash generation. We ended the quarter with $16.6 billion in -- of liquidity and adjusted net debt of $19.1 billion, roughly flat with the December quarter though above where we expected to be due to aircraft financing decisions. Let's now look forward into the June quarter. We expect a nearly $2 billion improvement in our pretax results. If the recovery progresses in line with our expectations and fuel remains at current levels, we expect to narrow our pretax loss to between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, with progressive improvement through the quarter to breakeven in the month of June. The key driver of improvement will be the sunset of our middle seat block, increasing our inventory available for sale at minimal cost. We also expect continued strong performance on our non-fuel cost and still target levels below 2019 by the fourth quarter. In 2020, the team's delivered strong cost performance by baselining aggressively. In 2021, we are focused on driving cost leverage as we rebuild the network and revenue returns. We are seeing that leverage materialize in the June quarter, with a small increase in costs on a 20% increase in capacity, driving a 12% to 15% improvement in non-fuel costs sequentially. Compared to the same period in 2019, non-fuel CASM is expected to be 6% to 9% higher, including three to four points from rebuild items. Adjusted fuel price is expected at $1.85 to $1.95 per gallon and fuel efficiency for the quarter is expected to remain better than 2019 by more than 10%. Bringing these items together at the midpoint of our guidance, June quarter total operating expense is expected to be down approximately 35% from June quarter 2019. We expect daily cash generation in the June quarter as demand further improves. Now, let me comment on our fleet strategy, a key enabler of our cost performance. Our accelerated fleet transformation drives more than $400 million in annualized cost benefit relative to 2019, driven by fuel efficiency, simplification, and gauge. These benefits have enabled excellent cost performance and will support further inflection in our financials as the demand recovery accelerates. Since the pandemic began, Delta has taken a measured approach in matching supply with demand. That discipline, combined with the great work of our fleet and tech ops teams, have positioned us to capture fleet efficiencies, while preserving optionality on upside capacity levels for the future that will utilize flex fleet if demand warrants additional capacity. As Glen said, we have the ability to flex capacity in either direction based on the demand. The teams have plotted a path to invest in our fleet with maintenance that will either support higher flying levels if warranted or largely offset costs we'd otherwise incur in the future. Let me now move to the balance sheet. With our cash flow and earnings close to inflection, we've begun to reduce our debt levels and chip away at our $4 million daily interest burden. In the March quarter, we set in motion our first phase of debt reduction. Using $3 billion of our liquidity, we are paying down debt, funding our pension and acquiring aircraft in the June quarter with cash. Combined, these initiatives drive $240 million of annualized savings and free up $2 billion of lending capacity. On April 1, we contributed $1 billion to the pension. This accelerated contribution, along with strong returns produced by our pension team, position the funds to be more than 95% funded by year-end under the Pension Protection Act that determines cash funding obligations. On a GAAP basis, we expect to be more than 85% funded by year end. We are now assessing an additional contribution of up to $1 billion to achieve fully funded PPA status by year end. It is really exciting to see our long-term pension vision crystallize. The combination of contributions and strong returns over time, now position us where we expect no material contributions to the plan beyond 2021, freeing up an average of more than $1 billion annually of our cash flow. Adjusted net debt is expected to be $19 billion to $19.5 billion in the June quarter as we draw down liquidity to fund the pension plans and pay cash for aircraft deliveries in the June quarter. We expect normal amortization of debt, including the $600 million unsecured maturity in April, to be approximately $850 million in the June quarter. We're also working on a longer term vision to restore and improve upon the strong financial position we enjoyed pre-COVID. Our financial foundation has greatly helped us to weather this crisis, while investing in our future and avoiding dilution for our owners. In closing, I am proud of what the Delta team has accomplished over the last year. The Delta Difference that Ed mentioned has never been more important, nor has it been more pronounced, thanks to all 75,000 of you for protecting each other, our customers and our future. We have exciting opportunities ahead. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Julie to begin the Q&A. Julie Stewart : Thanks Gary. Travis, we are ready for the analyst questions if you could give the instructions on how to get into the queue. Operator : Yes, ma'am. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey, good morning. Thanks. I wanted to ask you about restart bottlenecks. As we travel more, it feels like staffing levels are very tight. And that's just not an airline observation, but really across service providers, hotels, car rentals, it feels like there's understaffing right now relative to demand. And I think there's been some anecdotes about a hard time filling open positions. Obviously, the airline industry is in a different position given PSP, but I wanted to ask you, as you gain confidence in the demand recovery, what are the bottlenecks in getting spooled back up? Are you short staffed today relative to any of your work groups or is it really just a pilot training exercise? Ed Bastian : Hi Duane. I think the issue you talk about in the broader hospitality sector is an issue -- I don't think it's an issue for the airlines, but I know the hotels, rental car providers that you say are having a difficult time getting staff back, given the level of unemployment and other stimulus that's been provided into the general economy, we're not experiencing that issue at all here at Delta. Our people have been at work throughout the entire the entire time. I'd say the biggest bottleneck -- two bottlenecks that we face, which I feel very good about where we're at, is clearly getting our pilot training and our pilots into the right categories and ready to fly. And secondly, maintenance, making certain that we got our aircraft and our engines and all the work ready for a pretty quick rebound. It's a -- we had some cancellations on Easter Sunday, a couple of weeks ago, about 100 in the business and we've noticed -- it's been a trend on some of the holiday weekends, but for the last few holidays, certainly President's Day and Easter, not nearly the challenges that we experienced earlier in Thanksgiving and Christmas and it's because our businesses is dealing with the tension between making sure that we've got as many costs out and saved and people on whether it's voluntary leave or some other alternative plan and being ready to respond to demand as it comes back. I feel pretty good about where we sit for the common spring and summer. We spent an awful lot of time understanding that. You also need to appreciate that in certain parts of the country, the virus is growing at a faster rate than others. We've had vaccinations moving and that's impacted a little bit on the pilot availability because pilots need to sit for a couple of days once they -- every time they get a shot. But all-in, I think our team is well-positioned and ready for the rebound that we see coming this summer. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thanks. Thanks for that Ed. And then just for follow-up and I think Gary touched on it, but how do you think about the range of outcomes on June, whether it's capacity or revenue, what ability do you have here in 2Q to flex up if demand plays out better than what your guidance assumes? Thanks for taking the questions. Ed Bastian : Well, the biggest flex lever we have is the middle seat, which comes available May the 1st and you're going to see a significant capacity bump from April to May because of the seat. So, we're not anticipating a significant amount of schedule -- additional schedule requirements. Probably the biggest question mark we have is the international space and we're working closely with the international authorities to be ready to fly when they enable travel, particularly in the transatlantic markets, but I'm not contemplating us having a big challenge getting seats in the market for June. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski, Barclays. Brandon Oglenski : Yes, thanks for taking my question. Gary, you walked through a lot of changes on the balance sheet there, but I think you said you're going to end the quarter or 2Q that is with about $19 billion to $19.5 billion in net debt. I guess, could you just talk to, again, the priorities on the fleet and the pension pay down, as well as, like where you'd like to see that net debt number by the end of the year and then maybe a longer term goal around the balance sheet? Gary Chase : Yes, well, Brandon, we're not going to comment on where we'll be by the end of the year. What we've been very clear about as long-term goal was that we want to be back to an investment-grade quality balance sheet. If you think about it, simplistically, our net debt is up about $8.5 billion since the end of 2019. So, one easy way to think about what we need to do is get that back down to the $10 billion range. In terms of near-term priorities, you noted one we did make beyond the quarter -- on April 1st - we made a $1 billion contribution to the plan. We've discussed in here the potential for up to another $1 billion to achieve that fully funded PPA status. The other things that you should expect to see from us would be we're going to continue to pay cash for our aircraft, which not only prevents us from incurring debt, but it obviously builds our unencumbered collateral base. And then we have ongoing debt maturity. So, in this quarter alone, in fact, on Monday, we will pay a $600 million unsecured maturity. Over the course of the rest of the quarter, we'll have another roughly $250 million of regularly scheduled amortization, and another $400 million of that across the second half. So, you'll continue to see those debt levels work down for all of those reasons. Brandon Oglenski : Appreciate that. And has the pandemic made you rethink your minimum liquidity threshold that you're comfortable carrying going forward? Gary Chase : Well, we've looked at this a number of different ways. We're thinking about it on an interim basis. We've looked at it a number of ways and they're all kind of pointing to the same zip code. So, we've sketched out about a $10 billion to $12 billion interim floor for liquidity that we want to see. I think it's important to note though, that we don't have that thought process in isolation and I'll just repeat one of the things that you see us very deliberately doing is consciously building the unencumbered collateral base as we go. So, in addition to thinking about where we want to be with liquidity, our mind is also on continuing to build that unencumbered asset base so that we've got the flexibility. Brandon Oglenski : Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Jamie Baker, JPMorgan. Jamie Baker : Hey, good morning, everybody. First question for Ed, or maybe for Glen, I appreciate the endorsement of the third quarter profit. From a high level, can you expand on what it's going to require? I mean, can you get there solely on domestic leisure recovery or do you need some percentage of international reopening or corporate to improve from down 80 to down 60, that sort of thing? Ed Bastian : Hi, Jamie. Obviously, there's still a ways to go between here and there to get to the third quarter. Clearly, the number one dependency is the vaccination rate and getting to herd immunity in our country. And all the experts we talked to, including our own doctors tell us that early summer, is when we should expect our country to be in some form of early herd immunity and that will continue to inspire additional travel. Yes, we're working on reopening international corridors. I think the one that is most likely to be open for the third quarter, hopefully, is the U.S.-U.K. travel corridor and we're spending a lot of time with the authorities both here in the U.S. as well as the U.K. so what's going to be required to get that done and hopefully early summer, that we'll see the corridor open, which will then bring some pressure I'm sure on other markets to follow similar suits and protocols. The middle seat opening is another huge leverage point. The fact that we've been carrying such a significant amount of our capacity deliberately not selling it's going to be a big add on there. So, when you think about all these factors, you need to think about the additional scale that we have from better utilizing our fleet. Our fleet is still somewhat probably 10% to 15% underutilized as we're operating it today. These are the types of things we look at to give us some real optimism that there's a pathway to get into profitability this summer. Jamie Baker : Okay, that's helpful. Second question for Gary and I suppose this builds a little bit on Brandon's question. But you cited the build in the ATL in the release in the prepared remarks, that was helpful. Thank you. A competitor of yours has said that one of their most important lessons learned from the downturn is you just can't count on the ATL anymore. Is that consistent with how you're thinking and how it ties back to how you manage liquidity going forward? Gary Chase : Jamie, I think I'll answer it this way; there are a number of factors that we put into the thought process about liquidity. It is safe to say that that was one of the stress points that we consider. Jamie Baker : Okay. Gary Chase : It's wrapped into the analysis I was describing that has us kind of landing in that $10 billion to $12 billion zone. Jamie Baker : Got it. Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you, gentlemen. Look forward to seeing you next month. Its going be getting back to in-person. Ed Bastian : Look forward to it Jamie. Operator : Our next question comes from Helane Becker, Cowen. Helane Becker : Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody. Thank you very much for your time. Two questions, Ed you referenced -- and you and I talked about this last month too, sustainability and the things that you're doing with respect to carbon sequestration and I think you mentioned other changes in the fleet. And I'm just kind of wondering, how should we think about getting to net carbon zero by 2040 and the costs involved in that? And if you think that that helps your corporate market share going forward? Ed Bastian : Sure Helane. As I mentioned, in my opening comments, sustainability is a real issue for us for our business and it's a problem now, and it can't wait till later to be addressed. We're doing as we've committed to invest and verified carbon offsets with the highest certification, which are the really the only real solution in the marketplace right now. And we appreciate -- there's a lot of concerns about efficacies and we are concerned also, and that's why we're so specific in terms of what we're investing in. But there is real evidence, they have a clear impact and we can't wait for those longer term investments to start paying off to reduce the footprint in the meantime. We're working with a lot of providers, whether it's in the energy arena or other technology providers, seeking solutions to de-carbonize our operations and our footprint. We've committed $1 billion over this decade towards investments along these lines. And as you see this become a increased importance to the current administration, their priorities. We're hopefully going to get some support from our government, particularly in the area of sustainable aviation fuels, which is critical. We don't have as an industry have a clear roadmap to net carbon zero by 2040 at the present time, but it's important that we have the mindset that we're going to do what it takes to continue to invest in a better future for all. Helane Becker : That's really helpful. Thank you. And then just on another subject. When we were down there for investor day in 2019, one of the things that we saw was the Delta tech ops and the maintenance operation, and so on. And I'm just wondering how you guys are thinking about that business going forward, given the huge reduction in older aircraft that exists out there in the world now. And your non-Delta customers, and how they're thinking about renewing contracts or whatever and how you're thinking about that business? Thank you. Ed Bastian : Well, we're excited about the -- sure Helane. We're excited about the MRO and its future and you're right in 2020, there was a dip in volumes as airlines pulled back, not just flying levels, but retired on a global basis some of the older fleets. But our MRO revenues are not down nearly in line with what were flying levels have come down to. And as we look to the pipeline of opportunities, there's still a pretty good backlog to dip into. So, team's doing a great job over there, first and foremost, taking care of the Delta fleet, but looking for opportunities to expand going forward and I think as your earlier question that Duane answered -- or asked around pipeline of blockages or obstacles to getting our businesses back. The MRO is going to be key for us not just helping Delta, but also helping some other airlines around the world, get their businesses back up and running as quickly as they can. Helane Becker : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Hunter Keay, Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. With so much liquidity and demand including, is there a better than 0% probability Ed that you do not participate in PSP 3? Ed Bastian : I'm sorry, Hunter, you said with the liquidity -- let me rephrase it, with liquidity we have, will we be participating in PSP 3, is that your fundamental question? Hunter Keay : I guess, yes. I'm just wondering if there's a chance that you turn down PSP 3 if things continue to improve like this or ask not to participate in it. Ed Bastian : We don't anticipate turning that down, though. Hunter Keay : Okay, thank you. And then Glen, as you talk to the corporates, and I know it's early, you think about 2022 spending, are you starting these conversations from 2019 spend and working it down? Or are you starting at zero and sort of building it up? Glen Hauenstein : Yes, I think we're looking at what we have today and building it back up again. And we don't know the outcome or when, but we do see is that slow and steady build. And we think as we get to the end of the summer, as we said in the script as the vaccination rates continue to improve, and officers continue to return that we will see an acceleration as we head into the fall. And I think still unknown where we'll wind up this year and where we'll wind up in summer of 2022. And that's I think we're going to work on the flexibility of our fleet to flex up or down depending on what we see in the market at different points in time. Ed Bastian : To add to Glen's points, we did update the corporate survey that we commented upon last quarter and the numbers continue to look favorable. 36% of -- and this is -- many of our large corporations participated 36% expect to be fully back travel to pre-COVID levels by 2022, and another 16% by 2023. So, 52% say they're anticipating get back to full levels. Only 8% of the corporations that we survey say that we'll never get back to pre-COVID levels. And there's 40% that that are unclear as to what level of additional flying that we -- that they anticipate. So, if you take a fairly conservative view on the 40% uncertain and 8% that never get fully back and say that only 50% of that returns, then we're looking at 75% to 80% of our corporate revenues coming back over the course of the next couple years, which I continue to think is conservative, and we're working hard as people feel confident getting back out into the sky to get that business volume back to where it was. Hunter Keay : Thank you both. Operator : Our next question comes from Ravi Shanker, Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Morning everyone. I have two questions from me, one near-term and one longer term. In the near-term, how would you characterize the current competitive environment are out there? Obviously, early days yet and everyone's trying to do obviously, add capacity to places the people want to go. But are you encouraged by what you're seeing right now? And do you think it gets better or worse from here as we open up more? Ed Bastian : No, I think there's really two things that we would talk about and they are different scenarios. One is internationally coming out of the pandemic; I think we see a vastly improved competitive scenario with a lot of the ultra-low cost or low cost players in each region coming out of this much weaker or gone. And so as we see Europe come back, as we see Latin and the Pacific come back, I think we're going to see a much improved environment for many years ahead of us. And domestically, I think you characterize it quite well as people are traveling differently than they were pre-pandemic and while we are back at 85% of demand, that 85% is going different places than it was pre-pandemic. So, you see a lot more capacity from the industry in places that people are interested, basically, the less, the wide open spaces, the Florida markets, the Latin leisure markets. And so we've put our capacity where people want to fly and I think that's where we'll continue to focus and I see -- ultimately, I can't tell you what our competitors are going to do with capacity, but I think we feel really comfortable about how the U.S. arena is developing. Ravi Shanker : Great. And just looking at it longer term, I don't know how much of your time is spent thinking about 2022 and even 2023 at this point, but look everyone's looking at 2019 as a baseline, but given the huge pent-up demand and the huge amount of excess savings with the consumer, do you think there's a likelihood that we significantly surpass 2019 levels of travel in 2022, 2023 and beyond? And if so, do you have the ability to service that without bringing on significantly more resources? Thanks, Ed Bastian : Ravi, I wish I had a crystal ball that was clear to know with some degree of confidence. Certainly, there's enormous pent up demand. Consumers have built up a lot of wealth over the pandemic, people have really lost the connection that they look to recreate and get back together, whether that's for leisure, purpose, or business. And I think over the course of the next 12 to 18 months, we're going to see a strong surge as markets reopen for different categories as well as different borders. Looking out into the next couple years, does that mean we'll be beyond 2019? I think it's possible. We have flex in our fleet, in our order book to address that. We're not going to be limited. If there's demand out there, we're going to be positioned to be able to service. Ravi Shanker : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Savi Syth, Raymond James. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning. This is actually Nat on for Savi. Thanks for the time. A couple quick ones for me. Being we're just on the international topic, in terms of leveraging your international partners, how you plan on positioning your domestic network for that? Or are there any changes necessary or priorities to your coastal hubs? Glen Hauenstein : I think one of the things we're excited about as we come out of this pandemic is the strength of our international partners, as I mentioned earlier, is, international is taken much more of a reshape than domestic given the fact that a lot of international carriers didn't receive government support through the pandemic and are going to either be much smaller or not be there as the pandemic way eases off. And so we are very encouraged about continuing to leverage our partner hubs as the first wave of pre-pandemic international travel comes back. And that's really what we've done so far. And I think, yes, there will be opportunities for us to reshape our domestic to better feed our internationals coming out of this than we had going in. But we'll deal with that as it occurs as opposed to anticipating. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thanks, Glen. And then one quick one on the fleet, fuel efficiency is impressive, it seems like that's taking hold well, but do you expect that kind of level to hold back to full utilization? Thanks again for the time. Gary Chase : Yes, well, as we said, about half of the 12% improvement that you saw in the quarter versus 2019, is really structural change driven by the fleet renewal that we've been talking about. So, you can think of the remainder as conditional on where we are on the system. We did say, however, that as we look into the second quarter, we expect at least a 10% improvement on where we were for the same metric in 2019. So, do expect continued fuel efficiency certainly through the June quarter of significance. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, thanks for that clarification there. Operator : Next question comes from Andrew Didora, Bank of America. Andrew Didora : Hi, good morning, everyone. Glen just curious on your booking curve commentary in terms of how it continues to lengthen, is there -- are there any data points you can put around this? Maybe how much of your 2Q budgeted revenues are already on the books versus how that typically compares to normal times or anything you can help quantify that for us? Glen Hauenstein : Well, through the pandemic, looking curve it compressed and starting about middle of last month, for the first time ever, we saw advanced bookings outside of the 60-day window is actually surpassing the percentage of bookings that were in that category in 2019. So, hopefully I can give you some context that people are feeling much more comfortable booking further out in the curve. And I think we're looking at several things. One is I think in the U.S., they're feeling much more comfortable in domestic flying, knowing they'll get their shots, knowing they'll be able to travel, still waiting for more and more events to open and places to open and kind of one of the things that continues to accelerate the domestic demand and then really waiting for the internationals to reopen in earnest. I think people are now looking at it, the fall and making some speculative bookings that Europe will be open in the fall. There are not a great number of those out there yet, but certainly, there's interest out there. And I do believe that in the next month or two, we'll see at least some of the European countries attempting to reopen, and that will hopefully put pressure on the others to figure out ways to reopen their markets. Andrew Didora : Got it. It makes sense. And then my second question here just for Ed, I guess, more bigger picture here. I mean coming out of the pandemic after past downturns that meaningfully affected the industry, there have been some pretty big changes out there, right. But this time around, we really haven't seen that, there's plenty of liquidity; airline survived, no consolidation, no hub closures. Has any of this surprised you? And why do you think a lot of these have not happened this time around? Ed Bastian : Sure Andrew. No, it doesn't surprise me at all. And it's primarily because of the government support that the U.S/ airlines have received in terms of PSP. When you think about the significant levels of support and ensuring that that support goes to retaining employment across the industry as a national priority, there really isn't a lot of change structural. You use that money to try to get your business back up, which was what they were intended to do. Certainly on an international level, we're seeing a lot of change. There's been a lot of international restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations, changes, which I don't think we really fully appreciate the full extent of that. It's going to take some time yet to play out. I think it'll help and benefit the U.S. industry because we're going to be competitively stronger than in the international landscape than we were previously. So, we'll see how that plays out. Andrew Didora : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg, Deutsche Bank. Mike Linenberg : Hey, good morning, everyone. Hey, just two here. The first one to Glen. Glen have you come up with an estimate of what you think the net revenue hit that you incurred because of the middle seat block, and I would be most focused on the month of March where you actually had pretty good demand, and we're probably spilling traffic? Glen Hauenstein : Yes, we've looked at that. And I think maybe for the month of March in particular and clearly as we got to the end of -- or as the traffic continued to rise again -- and confidence returned, it got to be a more expensive proposition. So, for the month of March, it was probably between $100 billion and $150 million of gross revenue that we left on the table not blocking the middle seat, but really ensuring that demand came back and ensuring that our brand came out of this very strong. And I think had we the choice to do it over again, we would do it in a heartbeat because I think it's something that really set Delta apart through this pandemic is putting consumer confidence and the confidence in health and safety first, was a very important part of how we've invested in our brand through this pandemic. So, I think that's when we see this real competence returning in the April-May time period that was also one of our big cues to say it is time to let it go away. Mike Linenberg : Thanks for the color there. And then just my second question to Gary, on the $1.85 to $1.95 fuel guide, is there an embedded refinery loss in there? What is if there is on a per gallon basis? And sort of sort of a part two to that, as I recall, I believe the voluntary participation in the CORSIA program was supposed to commence I believe in 2021. In fact, is that true? And where's that going to show up on the Delta P&L is in fact that does kick in this year. Thank you. Peter Carter : Good morning. It's Peter Carter. So, from the CORSIA perspective, this is the year where we benchmark so this is the year where our use will be determined for future years. Mike Linenberg : Okay. Peter Carter : And it is completely voluntary, but we're fully participating. Gary Chase : Yes, and Mike on the first part of your question, the $1.85 to $1.95, it does contemplate a loss at the refinery. It's not as substantial as what we experienced in the first quarter. The fuel curve that we're using is generally what you see out there, crude in the low $60s and cracks in the $5 to $6 range. Mike Linenberg : Great, very helpful. Thanks. Thanks both. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Our next question comes from David Vernon, Bernstein. David Vernon : Good morning, guys. A couple of questions for you on the contours of the revenue environment, if we look at kind of where average fares are sort of trending based on some of the arc data and other sources out there, it looks like the average fare levels lower than we were in 2019. Can you talk to how much of that is sort of mix and loss of business travel demand? And what maybe like-for-like leisure yield would look like today versus 2019? Ed Bastian : Maybe I'll take a stab at that is -- and give you a little bit of a forward look is we have clearly in the month of May, we're calling May a transition month because we are putting the middle seats back in which gives us a substantial increase in our capacity levels. And we're expecting that May will come in with an absolute load factor of 75%. As we get into June, and the more peak travel season, and with those seats being absorbed into the marketplace, we believe that we will move from the 70s into the mid 80s, that gives us a little bit of an opportunity to start to manage yield a little bit more than we have in the past. And so structurally, we think we're in a pretty good space in terms of the structure of leisure travel and fares being within the range of where we were in 2019. And so as we head into the summer, we believe that the real pressure on domestic yields will come primarily from the lack of business travel, not from the structure themselves or not for leisure travelers paying significantly less than they did in 2019. Does that help answer your question? David Vernon : It does. I guess and maybe just as a follow-up as you think about getting the yield management sort of levers to work in the revenue optimization systems. How long do you think from a domestic standpoint, like when do you think you'll actually be at a level where you're not just starting that process, but you're kind of more at a run rate of getting that full benefit of managing appeals? Ed Bastian : Well, remember, the way the yield curve works is we're always saving for the last minute business traveler, who's -- there are not that many of them out there this year, they're substantially less than they were for 2019. So, you won't see I think the full impact of yield management flow into the revenue equation until a little bit later, probably early fall. So, summer is going to be about managing leisure demand and there's a little less opportunity in terms of saving that last seat for the business customer. So, as we move through the year, I think we're going to get say September-October to really be in a much better position to manage yield through the traditional RM systems. David Vernon : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Catherine O'Brien, Goldman Sachs. Catherine O'Brien: Good morning. Thanks so much for your time. So, a little bit of those shorter term take on Ravi's question earlier, regarding your plans to get to 75% of 2019 capacity in the fourth quarter, is that the structural maximum based on your fleet and crew retirements? And if we do see that wave of pent-up demand that you discussed in your CNBC interview this morning, Ed, would you consider sourcing additional aircraft to be able to add more capacity back sooner or is that capacity plan that's really in line with your views on the piece of the recovery through year end? I realized a couple questions in there. Thank you. Ed Bastian : Thanks, Katie. We certainly have in the very near-term for this coming summer limitations to how much demand we can we can serve and its decisions that are taken six to 12 months in advance in terms of getting pilots into the right categories. That said, with a significant amount of capacity we're adding through the middle seats being returned to service, I don't think it's going to be a substantial impact on our ability to serve the demand that we see out there. Catherine O'Brien: Got it. And then maybe one on the cost outlook. You know you previously announced expectation that the company can achieve 2019 CASM on just 75% of 2019 ASM. I guess for that's still the expectation? And then second, is inflation contemplated in that figure or is that a like-for-like a year assuming 2019 labor maintenance costs, and the like that typically do see some annual inflation? Thank you. Gary Chase : Katie, that's the number that we expect to hit this year. And I would say I'm really pleased with where we are, I mean, we are on the trajectory. The 6% to 9%, as I mentioned that we're achieving in the second quarter, I mentioned the four points of rebuild that are included in there. But you heard Glen talk about some of the international flying that we're not doing now. Our international mix is down quite a bit. In particular, we're not flying a lot of the long haul international network yet. If you look like-for-like in what you're seeing in the second quarter, that's also about a five point headwind. So, kudos to the team here, everybody has really embraced it. And they've just done a great job. The whole company really has come together around it. As I mentioned, in 2020, it was really about aggressively attacking the cost base, we understand the mission this year is really getting that incremental leverage as the network rebuilds. And you're really seeing it in the second quarter, if you take a look at how the ASMs are coming on and the cost incurred to do that. It's really nice operating leverage. So, very happy with where we are and fully expect to be on that 2019 number by the time we hit the fourth quarter. Catherine O'Brien: Great, thank you. Ed Bastian : Katie, one other thing I'd like to add to the point. People probably don't appreciate the fact that for the last couple of quarters, Delta has actually been flying the most scheduled service of anyone out there. So, when people worry whether we were going to have the capacity and the seats in the market to fill it, we're flying more scheduled servers, because we're blocking so many of the seats on the individual airplanes. As we open that inventory up, we're going to be raised with anybody in terms of being able to provide service and strength into some of our key hubs and markets domestically. So, we're not we're not concerned in the short-term that we're going to be short aircraft or short staffed. Catherine O'Brien: Okay, great. Thanks for additional color Ed. Operator : Next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu, Jefferies. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Good morning, everyone and thank you. I guess, somewhat related to the last question, how are you thinking about international markets coming back up here, relatively upbeat guidance on that international capacity for summer 2021? How are you thinking about that in terms of geographically, are you seeing any dispersion in booking so far? Ed Bastian : Well, on the reopening of international borders, I think there's still more -- many more questions that are answers. We are focused on trying to get the U.S.-U.K. travel corridor open. I think that's the most logical and has the greatest value to us. And I think those are the markets where we'll start to see demand grow quickly when we can get that open and we're working with our partners at Virgin from the U.K. standpoint, as well as across not just the airline industry, but within the broader travel and hospitality sector too, figure out how we can get it open for summer. And we're making progress in that regard. When you think about other parts of Europe, there may be some occasional markets open this summer based on Southern Mediterranean leisure traffic that people will be interested in, but I don't I don't think you're going to see Continental Europe open in any meaningful way till later in the year. We'll probably unfortunately miss much of the summer for most of Continental Europe. On the other end extreme, I think Asia is going to be the long pole in the tent. I think that could take a year or more to start travel back up at scale. When you think about China, and Japan and many of the other Pacific markets, the one market that we will be spending a lot of time trying to support is Korea, with our partner at Korean. And South America is going to be somewhere in the middle. It's really going to be based on the success they have in trying to get the virus under containment in their countries, which we all know right now is a very difficult spot that they sit in. So, that's probably late this year, into the winter when you start to see South America open up. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you for that color. And then how should we think about progression of yields, particularly given that you guys have been successful in doing so. You mentioned summer's all about leisure and limited capacity. So, how are you thinking about that progression on yield? Ed Bastian : I think we're really focused on the unit revenues. And I think we outline the progression and of course, there's a yield traffic trade off that we're always monitoring. But when you think about getting 20 to 25 points of unit revenues sequentially between the end of March and June, that's a huge improvement and one that I think is indicative of what we'd be looking at for summer travel. And I outlined earlier we think that the traffic will be in the mid-80s for peak summer domestic, and that presents opportunity to manage yield. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi, Stifel. Joseph DeNardi : Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Maybe Ed or Gary, just looking at the fleet, pre-COVID you guys talked about NMA and as option for 757 replacement. I'm wondering if that's still the thinking or maybe kind of what the updated thoughts are with that? Are there new options kind of out there on the used aircraft side that changes the approach or how are you all thinking about that? And maybe, kind of when do you need to order something to -- for that? Ed Bastian : Hey, Joe its Ed. As you probably have seen or read the NMA is not being actively discussed at Boeing at the present time, but they certainly do have alternatives and new designs that they're thinking about, and we're engaged with those conversations. Nothing imminent, or on the short horizon here, but we are looking at the longer term opportunities with our friends in Seattle. Joseph DeNardi : Okay. And then you talked about March co-brand spend being up versus 2019, seems very bullish to me. Can you talk about the longer term target and your ability to get to the $7 billion that you talked about pre-COVID? Can you do better? And then specifically, how sensitive is that to corporate demand or not? It would seem more tied to leisure, but just interested in your thoughts there. Thank you. Ed Bastian : So, clearly, the co-branded cards are an array of purpose, including a lot of small and medium sized enterprises, where we're seeing a lot of success with the cards right now. And so I think, we feel very, very confident that we can get to the $7 billion and clearly the crisis has put a little delay on that. And we're sizing up how significant that delay is and how we can shorten that delay by new and innovative programs to stimulate demand for the card. And I think we feel confident coming out of this that the card performed at or above our expectations of how it would do in a scenario -- a recessionary scenario. And so we think a very bright future for that card. Joseph DeNardi : Thank you. Julie Stewart : Now, we'll go to our final analyst question. Operator : Our next question comes from Myles Walton, UBS. Myles Walton : Great. Thanks. Ed maybe a reflective question, given the level of government support and assistance the U.S/ airline industry has gotten in the last 12 months, does it reframe how you and others in the U.S. will look at subsidization of international carriers that was clearly a complaint pre-crisis? And is there a potential for almost a turning of the tables as they look at us and the level of support we've gotten in the U.S.? Ed Bastian : That's an interesting question Myles and certainly, we've depended upon the support from our government here to be able to sustain an essential service for our economy. I don't know what that means, in terms of long-term. Clearly, the Middle Eastern subsidies were not there as a support tool for essential service, they were there to grow their economies and grow their businesses. So, I think fundamentally, the nature of the intervention, not just in the U.S., but around the world that we've seen over the last year, is of a very different character. And we'll see on the other end of this where the international market slant and the level of subsidies that that continues. So, yes, we've been appreciative of that. But no, I don't think it changes the character of what our issues were in the past. Myles Walton : Okay, and maybe Glen, the shape of the quarter in June, obviously, 1Q was January-February versus March, is May -- April, May, June more linear in the recovery profile. Glen Hauenstein : Well, clearly, the big step up is from April to May as the seats get released. And then June is just sequentially better. So, more of a traditional seasonality, moving from May to June, and really it's about the capacity absorption of that middle seat, is this story of the second quarter. Clearly, in the first few weeks of data, it will -- people have to leave to come back. So, there'll be some imbalances. And so we see the first two weeks of May being a little bit later and then the second two weeks as you get into Memorial Day and that more traditional peak leisure period, which should be much stronger. Myles Walton : Okay. Thanks. Julie Stewart : And that\u2019s going to wrap-up the analyst portion of the call. I'll now turn it over to Tim Mapes, our Chief Marketing and Communications Officer to start the media questions. Tim Mapes : So, Travis, if we could just repeat the instructions as the members of the media lineup in the queue and just as a reminder, one question and one brief follow-up, and we'll try to get to as many of those as we can. Operator : Yes sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Leslie Josephs, CNBC. Leslie Josephs : On the pilot training issues, how much of that is contributing to your costs? Same question for the maintenance issues you discussed before the kind of the ramping up? And do you expect to hire pilots at all this year? Ed Bastian : I think Leslie; we mentioned that in the cost guidance for the second quarter the rebuild, the maintenance, and as well as some training is probably in a three to four point range of the 6% to 9% growth that we're seeing over 2019 levels. So, it's a meaningful amount that we're investing to get the business back. We've not made a decision yet with respect to hiring, but I do anticipate if we see the recovery, continue to gain strength that before the end of the year, we could very well be in the market for both pilot and flight attendant hiring again. Leslie Josephs : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Alison Sider, Wall Street Journal. Alison Sider : Hi, thanks so much. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you might be seeing at some of these leisure destinations that are proving to be really popular. Are there any constraints on any airports that you're looking at or that you've been talking to? Or are they -- are any of those airports starting to get really crowded? Ed Bastian : We haven't encountered that yet. So, we've been able to fly schedules that we wanted to fly to all those leisure destinations. Alison Sider : Got it. And I just I'm curious if you're thinking about or planning to do any more point-to-point flying -- flights that over five, some of your house, as some of your competitors have? Is that something that you're looking at ramping up for the summer? Ed Bastian : No, we have very, very strong performance from our core hubs in our coastal gateways. So, we're going to stay focused on them. Alison Sider : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mary Schlangenstein, Bloomberg News. Mary Schlangenstein : Thank you very much. We saw Southwest yesterday increase their number of Rapid Reward points that it's going to take to redeem an award, they increased by about 6%. I'm wondering if you can comment at all on whether that's something that Delta might be considering, or we might see you do down the road here? Ed Bastian : No, we're not considering that. And we're very excited about the value we're bringing to customers and grow our program. And we\u2019ve actually used the program to stimulate a lot of demand with really some very attractive offers that we've had in market across the U.S. And hopefully, our frequent flyers are enjoying the benefits associated with those track offers. Mary Schlangenstein : And can you talk about how you've seen the build of point, I mean, very few people were traveling, especially internationally as we all know, but what did you see keep up your level of points being built with a credit card use, did that surpass a travel or can you comment on that at all? Ed Bastian : Well, if you think about it, unfortunately, there weren't very many people traveling on the airline, which is the vast majority of issue. And on the credit card side, clearly that had a much more sustained. So, we don't feel that there's a huge imbalance coming out of the pandemics, but the difference between what points have been accrued versus what we anticipate being able to supply in the marketplace. And we're pretty excited about people returning to use their points. Mary Schlangenstein : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from David Slotnick, TBD. David Slotnick : Good morning everyone. Thanks for the call and the question. I want to go back to what we were talking about before, as you pointed out, the likelihood of the U.K.-U.S. tunnel is seemingly growing. Just curious if you can shed some light on what kind of demand you're expecting there, and how you would plan to capture that demand, especially if it's a last minute reopening kind of thing without being -- having aircraft and cruise over committed to some of the domestic and regional leisure markets? Ed Bastian : Well, certainly what we've seen is when customers can travel internationally, they are willing to and excited about it. And I think when you think about the places that you can go today, whether or not it's the Caribbean or the Latin, we have said that there's more than 100% of the demand restored to those places. So, we're over-indexing already versus where we were in 2019. So, as those open, we will be able to supply and as you think about it, there's still a significant number of our places that will be closed. So, if the U.K. were to open, we'd be able to satisfy as many seats as people needed to fill the demand. I think we're excited about that and we'll see how it goes. But the one thing I would have a takeaway is Americans want to travel and they want to travel abroad. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Silk, Travel Weekly. Robert Silk : Yes hi. Where is Delta at as far as Digital Health Passport development? And also you all see this -- how much impact do you see Digital Health Passports as being able to have particularly when you talk about on a global scale interoperability across nations versus simply the vaccines and the end of the pandemic being really what brings back international demand? Ed Bastian : So, we're spending a considerable amount of time building an open source platform, because as you probably know, there's a lot of different marketing technologies for Digital Health credentials, which I think is probably the more appropriate right versus passport, which gains a lot of negativity, calling them passports. The challenge we face is every government around the world is looking at their questions uniquely, and we need to start looking collectively at answers. So that'll be important, for example, as we reopen the U.S.-U.K. border as to what technology will be available to actually evidence vaccination, if indeed the regulator's even require a vaccination. It's not clear that that's been -- that's even be requirement. So, we're working to try to keep as open a framework as possible, working with health providers, technology providers, and our customers to ensure that when they need to show that they've been vaccinated or have been tested, they can do it in as efficient manner as possible. Robert Silk : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from John Biers, AFP. Hello, John, your line is live. If your phone is on mute, please unmute. John Biers : Thank you. Hi, John Biers at Agence France-Presse. I wanted to ask there was the whole controversy about the Georgia election law and there was a -- briefly there was a boycott Delta hash tag that went viral on and so forth. And you came out strongly against the law after it passed. I wondered if you had seen any impact on customers, either positive or negative in industry, if you could discuss whether you think there'll be any lasting impact on your brand with the public. Ed Bastian : No, we haven't seen any significant impact from the different discussions that have been going on in Georgia. Peter Carter : With that, Travis, we have time for one final question before we turn it back over to Ed for his closing comments, please. Operator : Yes sir. Our next question comes from Elliot Blackburn, Argus Media. Elliot Blackburn : Good morning. Thanks for making the time for me. I just hoped you could talk a little bit about especially in light of Delta's de-carbonization goals. How does the Trainer Refinery fit into Delta and how do you -- how are you guys looking at that facility going forward now? Ed Bastian : Well, it fits in as it always has, it's an offset to our exposure to jet cracks. And that's one of the things that we are saying. We had some questions about impact at the refinery, and one of the primary drivers of that -- there are two. But the first primary driver is just the fact that jet cracks right now are very low. I mentioned they were in the $5 to $6 range. We've seen them historically in $15 to $20 range. The other contributor to the near-term performance has just been a huge escalation in the cost of rents, which have gone towards the end of the fourth quarter, they were in the $0.60 to $0.70 range and they're, they're well north of $1 now. That's a market dislocation that we just don't see as sustainable. Elliot Blackburn : Given that, I mean, especially with the rent uncertainty, and also with your interest in an assay, I mean, are you guys looking at possibly converting that refinery to renewables or would you change operations at that refinery going forward? Ed Bastian : I think it's safe to say we're always evaluating all our options. What we're not going to do, though, is let some of these short-term dislocations guide our actions. This is an asset that has contributed a lot to the company over the last in the time that we've owned it, which is the better part of the last decade. We've got a world-class team, they're operating it, they\u2019re operating it efficiently. They're operating it cost effectively. And as I mentioned, it is serving the purpose that we've always had for it, which is an offset to the crack exposure that we have. Elliot Blackburn : Thanks very much. Peter Carter : With that, we'll turn it over to Ed for final closing comments. Thank you, everybody for your participation today. Ed Bastian : So, I'd like to thank you all for your participation and joining us this morning. As we sum up the call, it's clear that at Delta, we've reached an important inflection point, as we navigate the pandemic and move into the recovery phase of 2021. As the pace of vaccinations accelerate, our customers are reclaiming their lives. Air travel will be central as people reconnect with loved ones and business colleagues, replacing their screens with real human touch points as they venture out of their homes, and communities to experience the world again. Looking forward, with customer demand steadily rising, there is a lot of runway ahead of us. As we open our middle seats to booking and corporate and international begin to recover in earnest. And once the recovery of those segments are underway, we expect they'll prove to be a powerful cash and profitability lever to get our business back to where we needed to be. The strength of our balance sheet has been critical and I'm excited that we're shifting our focus to delivering, which will also be an important accelerator in our recovery. But with all of this, I have great confidence that Delta is well-positioned to lead the industry in the months and years ahead. I thank all of the people at Delta for your tremendous job, particularly over these last 12 months in positioning us for success. And we look forward to welcoming all of you back aboard our flights in the days and months to come. Thank you all. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Julie Stewart : Thank you, Katie and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us for our June quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining us today from Atlanta are our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our Interim Co-CFO, Gary Chase, and our entire leadership team will be available for Q&A. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta's performance and strategy, Glen will provide an update on the revenue environment and our brand momentum, and Gary will discuss cost, fleet, and our balance sheet. I would also like to welcome our incoming CFO, Dan Janki who is with us in the room today but will not be participating in Q&A. Similar to last quarter's call, we scheduled today's call for 90 minutes to make sure that we have time for plenty of questions. For analysts, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up, so that we can get to as many of you as possible. After the analyst's Q&A, we will move to our media questions, after which, Ed will provide a brief closing statement. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I'll turn the call to Ed. Ed Bastian : Well thank you Julie and good morning everyone. I appreciate you joining us this morning. As we speak we are well into the summer travel season. And if you have been to the airport in recent weeks you have seen first-hand how travelers are reclaiming their lives and returning to the skies. This increase in demand drove a better than expected revenue outcome for us in the June quarter with revenues down 49% versus 2019 resulting in a 6.3 billion total revenue. This was an impressive 76% sequential improvement from the March quarter. More encouragingly momentum is continuing as we exited June with a demand environment that's accelerating. Domestic leisure demand and yields are above June quarter 2019 levels and we see clear signs of business in international demand recovery heading into the fall.  Through the crisis we've earned an unprecedented level of brand loyalty and trust, thanks to the world class service, operational reliability and innovation that drives the Delta difference, and our commitment to safety, cleanliness, and wellness is as strong as ever. The people at Delta are our strongest competitive advantage powering our resurgence and running the best operation in the industry. It is because of our people's incredible work that Delta was honored as the number one airline for 2021 by JD Power. I want to thank every member of the Delta family for the professionalism, spirit of service, and warmth you show to our customers every single day.  I'd also like to thank our crews and operations teams for continuing to put our customers and their safety first as we restore our business. We are now in active recovery of our business and the challenges of getting our airline fully back to the service level our customers expect and deserve is daunting in light of the huge surge in demand that we are experiencing. But we're taking all the right steps primarily through increased staffing levels about Delta and our contract service providers to service this demand without compromising on the standard of care and cleanliness that our customers have become accustomed to on Delta throughout the pandemic. And even with these challenges our team continues to run the very best airline in the industry leading on all key operating metrics for the month of June and year-to-date.  For the June quarter we narrowed our pretax loss to $881 million. This was meaningfully better than initial expectations driven by demand strength. Importantly we achieved significant financial milestones during the quarter, these include returning to profitability in the month of June with a pretax margin in the high single-digits despite still missing 40% of our prior revenue from June of 2019 generating 1.5 billion of free cash flow and nearly 200 million of adjusted free cash flow in the June quarter. Achieving solid profitability and generating meaningful free cash flow a little over a year from the start of the worst crisis in this industry's history is an impressive statement about the resilience of our business and the great work of our people. In showcasing the value of the commercial partnerships that we have developed leveraging the Delta brand, we have created almost $1 billion in investment value this year through our partnerships with Wheels Up and CLEAR and I want to point out that $1 billion is against a zero cost base.  I want to give a big shout out to Kenny Dichter and the Wheels Up team as their listing on the New York Stock Exchange goes live today. We are proud to be Wheels Up exclusive commercial airline partners and largest shareholder with a stake valued at over $500 million. Also congratulations to Caryn Seidman Becker and the CLEAR team on their successful IPO. Our investment in CLEAR is worth approximately $340 million. And finally I want to congratulate Sir Richard Branson and our team at Virgin Galactic for making history last weekend and completing their first fully crewed spaceflight. It was exciting to watch Richard break new barriers once again, this time commercial space travel.  I take the time to mention these relationships because of the much larger eco system that Delta operates and attracts. And these opportunities to create value will continue to be nurtured as we extend our brand beyond traditional airline boundaries. With June profitability in the books we're now in the restoration phase of recovery and focused on harnessing the power of our differentiated brand and our resilient competitive advantages to drive sustainable profitability in the second half of 2021, and enable long-term value creation. Specifically, for the September quarter we expect a mid-single-digit pretax margin as demand continues to improve with the return of corporate travel and gradual reopening of international markets. We are starting to see signs of a resurgence of business in international travel both of which are supporting the next leg of the revenue recovery. And we're well positioned to take advantage of both with leading domestic corporate chair and a strong global network.  Around the country more and more offices are opening and people are reconnecting to their businesses and to each other. With 72% of our employees vaccinated, we officially reopened our own offices last month in June. And as I interact with other CEOs I'm encouraged to hear about their own plans to accelerate their return to office. That sentiment is coming through loud and clear in our most recent corporate survey with almost 95% of our accounts indicating they'll be returning to their offices by the end of this year. Domestic corporate volume grew from 20% base in March of this year, the March month that is, to 40% recovered in the June month and we expect it to be close to 60% recovered by September based largely on these reopenings.  I'm also encouraged by the strength that we're seeing in international. While we know international demand recovery will be very choppy and uneven, we're seeing strong bookings to Europe when countries open their borders. From our experience in the U.S. we're seeing the impact that widespread vaccinations have on reopening the economy. We know the same will be true for the rest of the world over time but are mindful of the risks that new variants posed to the pace of recovery and our team will stay very disciplined in restoring international capacity. As the recovery builds steam, we are making the required investments including hiring frontline and reservations employees, in investing ahead of the full recovery of the airline in places like maintenance and training. This will allow us to continue to provide industry leading service levels and prepare the airline for success in a stronger than previously expected demand environment. These investments are key to the execution of our strategy to win which is defined by providing best in class service to our customers and leveraging the brand while creating a simpler, more efficient airline.  The power of our brand has come through the crisis stronger than ever and we're seeing evidence of this across the business. The resilience of our American Express co-brand credit card program is a great testament to the increasing brand affinity that we have. Cards spend on the Delta American Express portfolio in the month of June was 115% recovered to 2019 levels for the same month despite travel purchases still being off by 25% in that same period. We're continuing to renew and simplify our fleet and yesterday we announced that we're opportunistically adding seven Airbus 350s and twenty-nine 737-900ers that will enter service over the next 12 to 24 months. These are current vintage to the aircraft that we operate in our existing fleet and we are adding these pre-owned aircraft for substantially less than the cost of new planes. These aircraft align with our fleet strategy that\u2019s focused on simplification, scale, size, and sustainability and create optionality for future growth or replacement in a capital disciplined manner. These transactions accelerate our recovery plans which also began with the exercise of 25 Airbus A321neo options in April. The A321neos which will start to deliver in 2022, offer the lowest seat cost in our fleet and will strengthen Delta's gauge advantage relative to our competitors.  Our recent actions on fleet enhanced efficiency throughout the cost structure. Gary will talk more about this shortly and we'll highlight the progress that we're making on our balance sheet and journey back to investment grade metrics. As our recovery path becomes clear so does our future as a carbon neutral airline. In 2020, we committed to our airline\u2019s carbon neutrality and we're taking actions today that are critical to our future. This includes a reduction in emissions that we're achieving with our fleet renewal, investments in sustainable aviation fuel together with many corporate partners, and the evaluation of long-term investments in carbon reduction and removal technologies. During the quarter we released our inaugural 2020 ESG report, which expands on the corporate responsibility reports that we have issued in the past. You'll be able to hear more about our ESG commitments as well, importantly as our multi-year financial targets and vision moving forward at Delta's Capital Markets Day, which we will be holding in person in New York on December the 16th. This event will give everyone an opportunity to hear from our management team, which over the past year we've strengthened by bringing in outside perspectives and promoting our deep bench. That includes Allison Ausband, who during the quarter pleased to announce, was named our Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Experience Officer. In addition, John Laughter, who I'm also pleased we announced as our new Executive President and Chief of Operations. Alison and John are Delta veterans who bring deep experience and unmatched expertise to their roles. In addition, our incoming CFO, Dan Janki brings extensive business and financial skills to his role, as well as a broad global perspective and operational experience that will serve us well in the recovery and beyond. Dan's background makes him the ideal leader to advance our efforts to restore Delta to our pre pandemic financial position. You'll hear from him briefly before Gary delivers the financial update. With this great team of serving leaders, we're building an airline that's positioned to drive long term value for all of our stakeholders. Our people and customers are owners in our communities where we live, work and serve. I could not be more excited about our future. And now I'd like to turn it over to Glen. Glen Hauenstein : Thanks Ed and good morning, everyone. 16 months after the start of the pandemic, I'm encouraged by the pace of the recovery and excited about our future. Delta is well positioned with a powerful brand, strong competitive advantages, and a differentiated customer experience, all of which are increasingly driving deeper customer engagement. During the quarter we saw consumer demand for travel return at an accelerated rate as pent up demand drove an increase for air travel. As customers returned to the skies, Delta is their airline of choice given our industry leading service that's provided by the best employees in the industry. This resulted in a more than $2.7 billion improvement in revenue from the March quarter.  Compared to 2019, revenues were 49% lower beating our initial guide on 39% less sellable capacity. Bookings in domestic and short haul Latin leisure markets recovered to nearly 90% of 2019 levels, and during the quarter we began experiencing strengthened demand to select European countries as they reopened. Domestic business travel is on an improving trajectory with corporate volumes 40% recovered in the month of June, doubling from the 20% recovery rate in March. Small and medium sized enterprise volumes continued to outperform corporates by 10 points and are now 50% recovered. I'll talk more about the encouraging trends we see in corporate in a few minutes.  From April to June passenger unit revenues improved by 25 points, with both load factors and yields strengthening through the quarter. This is a great accomplishment considering that we had the middle seat block in place for the month of April, which, when lifted on May 1st resulted in a 45% increase in sellable capacity with minimal incremental costs. So kudos to the Delta team for managing through this transition period and driving these outstanding results. I also want to congratulate our cargo team for an outstanding quarter with cargo revenues up 35% compared to the June 2019 quarter, despite running a much smaller operation. We are also seeing momentum in daily bookings and net cash sales. Our average net cash came in 20% higher than forecast, doubling relative to the March quarter. Importantly, in the month of June, our average net cash sales are 70% restored to corresponding 2019 levels that's running about 10 points ahead of revenue recovery as customers are making travel plans out into the future. As Ed mentioned, we're exiting June with a demand environment that's much stronger than just three months ago. Since the start of the year, we've seen a sequential revenue improvement from 35% recovery versus 2019 and first quarter to 51% in the second quarter. That trajectory is continuing and we expect our September quarter total revenue to be 65% to 70% recovered on capacity at 70% to 72% recovered when compared to the same quarter in 2019. This positions us for another significant sequential improvement in unit revenues. At the midpoint of our guidance, this represents another 2 billion sequential increase in revenue on approximately 10% higher capacity. We expect strong leisure demand to continue through the fall and winter and we're starting to see the next leg of the recovery take hold with improving trends in business and international travel. Delta is well positioned to take advantage of both with leading domestic corporate share and a strong global network. Corporate travel volumes accelerated in May and June with almost 95% of our accounts booking travel in the month of June. We're also beginning to see a return of consulting and sales related travel and higher volumes in traditionally business heavy markets like New York City and Boston. Our recent corporate survey results show that over 90% of our corporate accounts anticipate travel volumes to increase in the September quarter, up from just 33% in the March quarter. In addition to these survey results our close engagement with customers give us increased confidence of the acceleration of business travel, especially as we move towards the post Labor Day period as schools and offices continue to reopen.  We expect domestic corporate volumes will recover between 55% and 60% of 2019 levels by the end of the September quarter, up from 40% at the end of the June quarter. Despite volatility in global COVID recovery trends, international travel is accelerating with capacity and load factors increasing as we head into the fall. When we spoke last quarter, only two European countries had reopened for U.S. citizens, today more than 15 European countries are open and we're seeing strong bookings follow as border closings lift. We are also hopeful that 212F restrictions prohibiting inbound travel to the U.S. will be significantly reduced in the September quarter. The recovery in short haul Latin exceeded 2019 levels, but in long haul Latin demand remains muted as many countries are still closed. Pacific demand remains low and will likely be the last region to recover.  Delta has a strong platform internationally due to the structural changes in the landscape, but more importantly because of elements unique to Delta. First, we will have the number one joint ventures in each entity, and our international partners will emerge from their restructuring efforts more competitive than before. We look forward to continuing our valuable strategic relationships with all of our global partners as they navigate through the COVID-19 crisis and as they position themselves to emerge from their restructuring processes. We are confident these strategic relationships will accelerate our international recovery in the years to come.  Second, our hubs are powerful, offering extensive and efficient global coverage. The strengths of our global hubs resemble those of our core domestic hubs, namely strong presence and local share and the ability to connect traffic efficiently. Third, our wide body fleet renewal will be instrumental in our recovery and path to higher margins. Adding the seven A350s announced yesterday builds on our long-term pre-planned efforts. Our wide body fleet renewal program improves our product offering, enhances our cargo capability, reduces our unit costs, and is more efficient -- fuel efficient, contributing to a more sustainable future.  As we rebuild the airline, we're optimizing the network for the return of business in international travel and are building on the strengths of our core and coastal hubs where we've been able to improve our local share by three points from pre-pandemic levels. We also continue to put the customer at the center of everything we do, creating an enhanced premium experience. This is successfully de-commoditizing air travel on Delta, providing customers with the products and flexibility that they value most. Premium products are demonstrating resilience where demand is strongest with domestic and short haul Latin premium revenues outpacing main cabin by 5 to 10 points. We believe this will be reflected at the system level as premium revenue and other entities improves with a return of business and international travel at scale.  We're also seeing increases in customer engagement and brand momentum. This is evident in SkyMiles acquisitions which set an all-time record in the month of June, outpacing the prior record achieved in July of 2019. These acquisitions allow us to bring new customers into the Delta ecosystem. The engagement is also coming through the performance of our co-brand credit card program as customers are increasingly seeing the value proposition and continue to aspire for travel, status, and premium experience. For the quarter, program spend was 110% recovered to 2019 levels driven by improving T&E spend indicating customer\u2019s desire to explore the world and reconnect with friends and family. We exited the quarter with program spent around 115% recovered for the month of June. [Indiscernible] brand account acquisitions improved more than 75% sequentially and were around 90% recovered to 2019 levels for the quarter. In addition we're seeing more customers moving into premium co-branded cards given the value of proposition for those products. The improving trajectory resulted in cash remuneration from American Express in the month of June exceeding 2019 levels. We expect remuneration will continue to remain at or above 2019 levels into the second half with significant growth opportunities in the years ahead.  In closing the foundational building blocks for our long-term success are in place. With the industry's best domestic and global network renewed an efficient fleet, a de-commoditized product and a highly valued brand and the industry's best employees we continue to extend our commercial and financial lead. Combining that with our efficient cost structure puts us on a path to improve on our pre-pandemic margins and generate sustainable free cash flows allowing us to reinvest in the business and restore our balance sheet strength. Delta\u2019s future is incredibly bright. And with that I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome our incoming CFO to Delta. Dan, I'm looking forward to working with you and now I'll turn the call over to you for a few minutes. Dan Janki : Thank you Ed and Glen for the warm welcome. Certainly pleased to be here and begin working closely with Ed, Glen, and the entire executive leadership team. To ensure that we continue to establish clear priorities, deliver on our commitment, and build a more resilient valuable Delta there's no doubt it is an interesting time to join. What really drew me to this opportunity at Delta is the unique culture, industry leadership, and growing brand strength with customers. It's a combination like no other in the industry. It's really clear that there's a great deal of talent in the finance organization. I'm humbled and honored to lead this organization forward through this pivotal time.  The key guiding principle for me will be open and transparent communication with the financial community. I look forward to speaking to all of you and getting to know the key stakeholders in the coming weeks and months including many of you on the call. Now I'll turn it over to Gary for the financial update. Gary Chase : Thank you Dan and on behalf of the entire finance team welcome to Delta. Good morning everyone on the call and thanks for joining us. Delta people shined and carried our brand to new heights during the crisis. Those efforts combined with the strong demand recovery Glen described and the benefits of operating a simpler and more efficient fleet are enabling us to cross a number of key milestones on our journey to return to and exceed 2019 performance. Let me quickly review the second quarter and then provide color on our second half cost outlook. I will wrap with a discussion of our capital outlook and balance sheet. Starting with highlights from the quarter, we reported an adjusted pretax loss of 881 million, more than $2 billion sequential improvement and generated a solid June month profit despite revenues for the month of June still 40% below 2019. Non-fuel costs rose 6% sequentially on 21% higher capacity as the teams continued to rebuild our network efficiently. Non-fuel CASM was 9% higher than 2019. We realize savings from tax credits and third party rate reductions that were offset by rebuild expenses and maintenance and pilot training and a non-cash expense for employee flight passes awarded to our employees in recognition of winning the JD Power award.  Adjusted fuel price per gallon of $2.12 was 11% higher than the first quarter, including a $0.23 per gallon impact from refinery losses. We realized a 7.1% fuel efficiency gain versus the June quarter of 2019 with the majority driven by fleet renewal. Demand momentum field cast sales across the booking curve driving $1.5 billion of growth in our air traffic liability to nearly 7 billion, now 300 million higher than the same period in 2019. With the strength we see in the demand environment we expect our air traffic liability to remain above 2019 levels into next year. Daily cash generation was substantially positive for the full quarter. More importantly we generated nearly 200 million of free cash flow excluding our 1.5 billion pension contribution and 2.5 billion in PSP grant proceeds. We are transitioning now away from daily metrics to focus on regular free cash flow, the best measure of value creation as we turn the corner on profitability and look to restore our financial strength. As we head into the second half we are excited to shift our focus to return into profitability generating cash and restoring and exceeding our pre-COVID results and financial position. With continued recovery and limited cost growth, we expect to be profitable in both the September and December quarters at current fuel prices.  Regarding the cost outlook, I'm very happy with the team's performance in the first half as we continue to rebuild the network efficiently. We remain on a path to achieve non-fuel CASM below 2019 levels by fourth quarter though the strength of demand recovery is creating some welcome cost pressure in the form of higher rebuild and selling related expense. We have also experienced inflationary pressure from vendors and our operating teams have accelerated hiring of frontline employees to ensure we maintain excellence in operations in service levels as we rescale. Despite these pressures we will see continued leverage in key areas. For example, we expect an approximate 8% headcount growth through the end of the year on a nearly 15% increase in ASM production. We'll see our fleet utilization rise from 2Q levels approximately 15% below 2019 to approximately 5% in the fourth quarter. Our airports will also see better utilization particularly our coastal hubs as they move from 70% to more than 90% restored. As we accelerate maintenance and training in the higher potential capacity in 2022, rebuild expenses are stepping up in both the third and fourth quarters to 5 to 6 point cost headwind versus 3 to 4 points in the first half. September quarter will see non-fuel costs grow sequentially at roughly the same rate as capacity due to the higher rebuild and revenue related expenses I mentioned. With these factors September quarter non-fuel CASM is expected to be 11% to 14% higher than 2019. We expect to close the gap to 2019 non-fuel CASM in the fourth quarter through continued volume leverage as capacity remains essentially flat from the third to fourth quarters instead of the more normal seasonal decline of approximately 15%. Adjusted fuel price per gallon for the third quarter is expected at 205 to 215. The fuel efficiency for the quarter is expected to remain better than the September quarter 2019 period by approximately 5%.  On the capital outlook, we now expect gross CAPEX of approximately 3.2 billion in 2021 up from our original guidance of 2.5 billion driven by our aircraft announcements. Hats off to our fleet and technical supply chain teams for landing these compelling opportunities that meet three key criteria. These transactions are opportunistic and take advantage of attractive economics in the used market. These aircraft types are currently active in our fleet and entirely consistent with our fleet simplification strategy. In addition, these aircraft along with the 321neo options we exercised in April will support the potential for up to 7 points of additional capacity restoration at compelling marginal economics by 2023. We have a lot of additional optionality in our fleet plan to flex capacity up or down at low cost depending on the shape of the recovery. Our 717 and 767 fleets are our largest levers. We're still flying these fleets at scale today and could retire additional units or reactivate parked aircrafts to meet higher demand scenarios.  Let me now move to the balance sheet. With improving financial performance and a strong liquidity position, we're using cash to reduce leverage and non-operating expense while rebuilding on encumbered assets and managing our debt maturity profile. During the quarter we pre-paid 450 million in aircraft related debt in addition to normal amortization of 875 million and contributed 1.5 billion to the pension plans. Additionally, we paid cash for all but three aircraft deliveries. Since October, our debt reduction initiatives have totaled 11 billion and freed up 6 billion in collateral. With the additional funding this quarter, we do not foresee the need to make any material pension contributions in the future. By year end, we expect the plans to be fully funded on a Pension Protection Act basis and 90% funded on a GAAP basis. With this level of funding and the plans frozen to new participants, we are now reducing the investment risk of the portfolio to protect our funded status. The great work of our Pension and Treasury teams over the last decade in funding this obligation frees up roughly a billion in annual free cash flow that can be used in the future to further delever or otherwise create value. Adjusted net debt is expected to be approximately 19 billion at the end of the September quarter, modestly increasing from where we ended June as we paid cash for aircraft deliveries. As we turn the corner on profitability and look to the future, we're excited to shift our focus to restoring our business and delivering long term value for our owners. Restoring our financial Foundation remains a top priority as we position for the future, and we look forward to sharing more of our long-term vision with you in December. Let me conclude by congratulating the 75,000 people who make the Delta difference a reality every day. These excellent results are your score card and a reflection of all you do to delight our customers. With that I will turn the call back over to Julie to begin the Q&A. Julie Stewart : Katie, can you please remind the analysts how to queue up for questions? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Helane Becker with Cowen. Helane Becker : Thanks very much, operator. Hi everybody and thanks for your time. Welcome, Dan. So here's my questions, my first question is I was wondering if you could talk about -- maybe Glen this is for you, how you expect the non-U.S. recovery to look by the different regions over the next say 6 to 12 months, if you can? And then my other question is, I think Glenn, you might have talked a little bit about this in the ATL line. Are you seeing that people are booking further out and I don't know if you can talk to, like, after Labor Day bookings or even holiday bookings, how they're comping to previous levels? Gary Chase : So Helane, first about the entities a little bit. We're seeing a U.S. based demand recovery to the open countries in the Transatlantic, and we expect our loads to move to be close to historical levels running probably in the low to mid-80s by the August, September, October period. Again, the 212f restricts Europeans from coming to this country. So I think we focused on those countries that generally have high U.S. outbound demand. And as we move forward, we will be adding a little bit of capacity but essentially keeping our levels flat where we would normally pull down in the September October time frame and focusing on our European hubs and distributing traffic through them. So I'm pretty optimistic about how the results could play out in the Transatlantic and that's really -- we have 35% to 40% of our travel still missing with the European origin piece not open for sale, and with business really not recovering at the same level as leisure. So pretty optimistic about where we can get to on this leg but there's a lot more to come in the Transatlantic.  In Latin, it's really the tale of two markets. One is the closing U.S. point of origin leisure market as well as Mexico business. Both of these are actually exceeding 2019 levels. So short haul Latin is doing quite well and we continue to expect that to be very, very strong as we move into the more traditional leisure season in the late fall. And then the Pacific, which I think Ed has talked in the past, we expect this to be the laggard due to low vaccination rates and continuing outbreaks over and restrictions in the Pacific, and we really don't see any impetus for that to be lifted. Now, I think we're looking at 2022 at the earliest, probably significant recovery in the Pacific.  So, Atlantic clearly the furthest along, that's great for us because 65% of our international revenues are in the Transatlantic. So we're excited about what we see in terms of U.S. demand there. Domestically post Labor Day, this is every month that we look from August to September and October, clearly as you move out, you have fewer and fewer bookings. But we have about a third of our September bookings on the books now. And we have as it sits today, and we expect to give some of this back, but we have positive yield in every one of the entities. We have sequential improvements in RASM [ph]. So I think we're seeing very strong indications of demand through the post Labor Day period. Of course, those are initial indications. We have a long way to go as we move closer and closer to those departure dates. Helane Becker : Got you, that's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu you with Jeffries. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Good morning, everyone. And thank you for the time. Maybe just on cost related question, on CASM they're expected to remain fairly elevated in Q3. How do you think about the Delta in driving CASM from up 11% to 14% in Q3 versus 2019 levels to flat in Q4? I get about half of that is rebuild cost but maybe what's the bridge and the moving pieces and more broadly, how do you think about cost headwinds and inflationary pressures? Glen Hauenstein : Well, we talked about the major drivers. The key is really leveraging the continued build on the network. And as I was describing in prepared remarks, generally, when we move from the third into the fourth quarter, we have a pretty big reduction in our activity levels. This year we expect that to be relatively flat. That gives us the opportunity to leverage the things that I was describing to get some good incremental leverage on our people, some good incremental leverage on our asset utilization, and it's just a natural outcome of the way the capacity progression is moving. In terms of how we see the bigger pieces, they don't change that much between the third and the fourth quarter. We expect that rebuild expenses will still be at elevated levels in that five to six-point range in both quarters. And one of the things I mentioned on the last call, from a mixed point of view, both the second and third quarters, we've got about a five-point drag from not having anywhere near as much of our long haul international flying, which is just structurally very low CASM, long stage length flying. As we move into the fourth quarter, it's still a headwind. It's not quite as much. It's about three points. So that's the color that I would add. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Conor Cunningham with MKM Partners. Conor Cunningham : Hey, everyone. Thank you. It's great to hear that corporate continues to improve as people return to the office. I do have to ask, like your competitors are now pushing to replicate some of your success that you've had with large corporates. So I was curious if you could talk to the moats that you have built around that franchise and how you anticipate strengthening that segment in the face of potential competition? Ed Bastian : Well, thanks, Connor. It's a very important segment for us, and we have one, as I think, you know, business travel news, Airline of the Year for 10 straight years and we expect to hopefully win it again this fall as well. Our team does a magnificent job of servicing the accounts, providing the technology, the access, the insights to make their job, travel on Delta as easy as possible. And that's supplemented by the great product and service that our people put forward every single day. We're the leading operational airline in the industry. So when you marry up the investments we've been making, particularly in the premium product sector, which our corporates are a main consumer of, with the great service ourselves and commercial team provide and the product and operational integrity of the business, it's a very, very strong moat. We have gained share over the pandemic, meaningful amount of share that we have gained. And the one thing that we have seen is when customers come to Delta, they don't leave. And so we're going to continue to expand upon that. Conor Cunningham : Good to hear, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : Hey, thanks. Good morning. I got two questions for you. The first one is for you, Ed. How do you feel about deleveraging the balance sheet if it hurts your ability to maintain market share? Ed Bastian : Good morning Hunter, I would like to ask you first you're sitting on a rocking chair estimate or no. Hunter Keay : Actually I am. Ed Bastian : I will rock back in my chair as I answer to you. That's good. Deleveraging is important to us. It's something that, first of all, we're the same team that's been here for over the last 15 years. We believe in derisking our balance sheet and our then paying down debt. And we also know that we can do that while also driving a premium product and service offering in the markets that we see as being critical to Delta. We were able to do both those things over the last decade and we'll continue to do that. The level of debt that we took on over the pandemic, candidly, it's a meaningful amount but it's not an overwhelming amount. It was about $8 billion of net debt that we took on during the pandemic. And when you think about, as Gary mentioned, we're basically done funding our pension plan with no more pension contributions required. As I think you also know that we've been averaging over the last several years, close to $3 billion, $2 billion to $3 billion a year in stock repurchases, which clearly we won't be doing in the next two to three years until we get our investment grade metrics back. And another billion on top of that of dividend distributions that we've been making. There's a substantial amount of free cash that is available to us as we reclaim investment grade for Delta. And we'll be sharing our longer term metrics at the Investor Day in December and showing you the path forward. But we can do all this and have plenty of headroom to compete hard and effectively in the marketplace. Hunter Keay : Okay, that's super helpful. Thank you. And then Gary, if you would just clarify, I think you said something about 7% capacity. Are you saying that the current plan for 23 system capacities to be 7% above 2019 but you can take that higher or lower if you need to, am I interpreting that correctly? Gary Chase : No Hunter, that's not what I was saying. What I'm saying is that the fleet actions we've taken give us the potential to add seven points to our capacity profile by 23. But I was also noting the flexibility that we continue to have with some of the flex fleets to go up or down. And I think the teams have positioned us really well to react to what comes at us in terms of the demand environment. Hunter Keay : I see. Okay, thank you, Gary. Thank you Ed. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Baker with J.P. Morgan. Jamie Baker : Hey, good morning everybody. And just apologies off the bat that my colleague Mark isn\u2019t joining us, but he is on one of your aircraft on a J.P. Morgan sponsored business trip. So I guess we're all better off. Glen, is there a way to tell what portion of summer domestic revenue is driven by reallocated international demand, for example, could you look at SkyMile behavior this summer, identify what portion of those travelers would have historically been in Europe or Asia instead? Glen Hauenstein : I think domestically we see redistribution towards domestic from long haul international. That's a natural occurrence. I think people are ready to get out. The exact quantification I think would be difficult. But we do see that if those leisure destinations are open, there's significant demand for that and that includes the transatlantic where it is open. And if you think about running load factors in the mid to high 80s in the shoulder season, as we head to the end of the summer here just on U.S. origin travel, pretty strong demand trends that we're seeing. So if it is open people would want to get there. Jamie Baker : Yeah, definitely. Thank you. And Gary, just a follow up on the ATL, and I haven't historically obsessed about the air traffic liability until we all sort of had to. Ordinarily, the second or third quarter sequential decline for Delta would be somewhere around $750 million to $800 million. If we continue to get the international reopening particularly for inbound U.S. could we model for something closer to a flat outcome next quarter, so staying in the $6.5 billion range, that sort of thing or would that just be too ambitious, I know you said it would be above last year's levels, but that still leaves a lot of room? Gary Chase : Yeah, Jamie obviously, there's still a lot of uncertainty around that in our thinking right now and that's embedded in how we're thinking about net debt is for a slight decline in that, but we don't expect that you're going to see the normal seasonal pattern as we move through the remainder of this year for all the reasons you just highlighted. Jamie Baker : Okay, perfect. Thank you, everybody. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Trent with Citi. Stephen Trent : Hello everybody and thanks very much for taking my question. Just a quick one from me. When we think about in certain pockets in the United States that we are seeing some difficulty with new variants and low vaccination rates, do you see any scenario in which Delta could trim capacity to some of these regions or reinstate on some routes, blocking off middle seats? Glen Hauenstein : Good morning Steve, I don't. As we've been monitoring our bookings and clearly we're mindful of the risks around COVID and the new variants and the continued information that the CDC provides us with, we have not seen any reduction or drop in demand, looking out over the next 60 to 90 days, which is about as far as our crystal ball can go right now. We know our customers are largely vaccinated. Our people are largely vaccinated, we have over 72% of Delta people are vaccinated and the vaccines work. And they are giving people the ability to get back to their lives. So no, we do not anticipate any changes at this time. Stephen Trent : Okay, appreciate that. And thank you. And I'm looking forward to seeing you guys in December 15th, I believe you said and thanks again. Glen Hauenstein : December 16th. Stephen Trent : 16th, excuse me, thank you. Fly down and see us on the 15th if you want. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Myles Walton with UBS. Myles Walton : Thanks. Good morning. Ed, I think at the beginning you mentioned commercial partnerships and creating $1 billion of value from Wheels Up and in CLEAR from zero cost base. I'm curious of your view on the [indiscernible] given the news by American as well as United on that front and where that fits in your portfolio of investments and operations over the medium term? Ed Bastian : Thanks Myles. As you can appreciate every one of the proposed manufacturers has been after Delta. We've heard from many of them. We're studying this space and we will continue to get good smartness space. I think it's at a very, very early stage right now and I think a lot of the plans that we see are a bit premature, candidly. But it's not anything that we are unaware of and I guarantee every one of those manufacturers would love to have Delta colors on their plane. So hard to predict timing but we're in the marketplace having lots of conversations. Myles Walton : Okay, and then maybe Gary just a clarification to CASM, next questions. I'm just looking in absolute dollars, it looks like sequentially 3Q. You're looking for the same unit cost, X and fourth quarter the same. And the improvement was really just about comps in 2019. Is that right and then for 2022 how much of these rebuilding costs go away and we get the tail end of those six points? Thanks. Gary Chase : Yeah, I'm not sure I would characterize it exactly that way. But it is about having more scale relative to 2019. So, sequentially I think that what you outlined is roughly accurate and that is what we expect. As we go into 2022, your question was about the sustainability of the rebuild. Myles Walton : Yeah, what goes away from what you're doing? Ed Bastian : Yeah, we definitely expect those to moderate. A lot of that is going to depend candidly on how the demand environment develops. What I would say is, what we've articulated is driving to levels below 19. We're not excluding rebuild expenses. This year they happen to be particularly high. As we get into 2022 we expect those to be more normal, and it's part of the thought process on what we've got to accomplish. Glen Hauenstein : Myles, if I could speak to that for a second, we at Delta our number one task is to safely get our business to back up with the service levels that our customers deserve and expect at Delta. And given the huge surge in demand that we've seen over the last 90 days, the entire industry is challenged with that. That's not a unique Delta position. And we're going to do everything we can to get ahead of it and that includes staffing levels, providing whatever support we need to the service providers and service contractors, training, maintenance, because we realize that this is about protecting our brand and our long term customer base rather than trying to manage costs for an individual quarter. We will hit the cost targets that we mentioned to you. One of the things that we learned a lot about Delta over the pandemic is our ability to manage down labor cost is really unique in this industry. And we have a whole lot more, many more tools and flexibility, I think, than we ever really appreciated. And so we shouldn't think about labor, which is the biggest part -- a big part of the rebuild cost, as a fixed costs, that's not going to stay. So the productivity, the efficiency, the ability to work closely with our people, we'll be in really good shape on the class run next year. And we'll protected our customers experience at the same time and the revenue base, which is the most important. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savanthi Syth : Good morning. Competing product is kind of good for the consumer and the industry but one of your competitors plans to grow like first class like room seats by about 10% a year through 2026. And just kind of curious if that level of growth is something we'll see at Delta because it's part of some kind of a structural trend or if that has an implication to Delta's premium kind of revenue leadership or how delta is set up to kind of compete against that? Glen Hauenstein : Sure. Well, I first like to say we're proud that we started the decommoditization process many, many years back and we're well along. And I think we're objectively maybe the furthest along in terms of exploiting that opportunity. There's probably more space out there for other carriers, given the appetite we've seen for these products that have been sustained through the pandemic. So I'm not going to articulate on anybody else's plan. But we think that there's continued growth in our fleet evolution, as we continue to update the airline over the next several years, our percentage of seats that are in the premium cabins continues to increase. And we think given the fact that we are still in the early stages of being able to distribute those products and services, to all of our customers through all of our channels, that there's plenty of opportunity for us to continue to grow that space in the next years, next several years. Savanthi Syth : That makes sense. Thanks, Glen. And maybe a quick follow up for you Glen as well. Just appreciate the color on the domestic corporate demand recovery. I know that's around volumes. Is that RPK and curious what that looks in terms of revenue, I'm guessing volumes have to recover first and then revenue comes back, but I'm just wondering if it's similar or if there's a disconnect there? Glen Hauenstein : Yeah, those are passengers and yields on domestic leisure are up. Yields on domestic corporate are down, but we see trajectory in domestic corporate and we expect that, as you say to continue as we move forward. Savanthi Syth : Makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Mike Linenberg : Hey, good morning. I guess two projection related questions for Glen. On AMEX over the last year, you sort of had backpedaled on when you would get to the 7 billion of contribution, obviously, because of the pandemic. The fact that I guess, the month of June or the June quarter we were 110% and 115%, in the month of June. Glen, can you update us, are we now not on just track but maybe at a pace that we'll get to that AMEX bogey prior than the previous forecast? Glen Hauenstein : Yeah well, I think that's something you'll have to come to our December. See I don't think we're ready to disclose the exact date yet but it suffices to say that we're feeling much better about making up some ground that we lost during the pandemic today than we sat six or nine months ago. Ed Bastian : Yeah, I would -- Mike, this is Ed. Mind if I chime in. I would say that we are thrilled with the relationship with American Express. Our team, their team, I was with Steve Squery [ph] last Friday, and I think we had the best performing card in the entire portfolio. Delta, even though we're the highest value that we create, I think we're also the best performing on top of that. So in terms of growth. So it's really been a great, great relationship and that's still without a lot of travel spend that's missing, international and business yet from the card. So we're excited. Mike Linenberg : Great. And then just sort of a second projection question, Glen. I mean, to watch you go from 20%, of corporate volumes to 40 and 60. And yet, even recently I think we had a survey from USA, U.S. travel and even the GBTA talking about U.S. corporate travel, getting back to I don't know, 70% to 85% by 2024, it just feels very conservative. I mean, it seems like we're running well ahead of that. Is that the case, or is there just something different, tell us where you guys are outpacing the industry? Ed Bastian : Mike, this is Ed, let me chime in on that one too. Because I've got the numbers right here in front of me. We've done our own survey, talking to our clients, the biggest the biggest companies in the world, and a very large number of them, and I couldn't make heads or tails out of what the GBTA was speaking to either. Let me give you the most recent survey and this is as of last week updated. 36% of our big corporates expect they're going to return fully to pre COVID levels no later than next year 2022 is 36%. Another 21% says fully back no later than 2023. Interestingly, only 5% of our of our big corporates say that we never returned to pre-COVID levels. 5% that had been 8% in previous surveys, it's now down 5%. While 38% indicate it's still unclear as to what their levels, not that they're not getting back, it's just the level of flying and the timing is still somewhat uncertain, which is understandable. So if you take the 2022-2023, that's 57% no later than 2023. And you assume, say 75% of those unknowns, the 43%, if you actually did 90% back over the course of the next couple of years. And frankly, I think it's going to be even better than that. So this is one of the things that as we have seen there's enormous pent up energy and demand for travel. Also in that survey, 93% of our customers said they're going to increase travel in Q3 over Q2 and many of those by meaningful amounts. So I think the surge is coming. And just as we've seen it on the consumer side, we're getting ready for it on the business side. And once you open businesses, offices, and you get international markets opened, I think it's going to be a very good run over the next 12 to 24 months. Mike Linenberg : Great, great insight gentlemen, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Ed, you have a good Board in my opinion, lots of experience driving real value in consumer industries, maybe arguably easier consumer industries. Can you give us some insight into debate at the Board level regarding balance sheet improvement as a priority, right here and now, versus investment. Are there differing opinions on investment rate versus balance sheet improvement? And I guess longer term is investing half of your operating cash flow, how we should be thinking about 2022 and beyond or have we kind of moved away from that? Ed Bastian : Well, thanks Duane. We do have a great Board, I agree with that, and there is a lot of good insight we garner from that Board. This is largely the same Board that's been with us over the last decade. It was the Board that was involved in and how we delevered coming out of the financial crisis in 2009. How we've the lead the industry in getting back to investment grade metrics over five years ago while delivering a premium product and service level and expanding internationally at a rate probably faster than anyone, particularly with the investments that we've made. So the Board knows the strategy that we're on, we've talked a lot at the Board level about needing to get our debt down of the balance sheet to get those investment grade metrics back. We'll give you some very specific guideposts on that when we have our capital markets day in December, so you know what to expect from us. And at the same time, we're also investing meaningfully into the business with opportunistic purchase of Airbus 350s and 737-900 that are current vintage, they'll plug and play. And we'll continue to be able to grow the business accordingly. So the strategy actually is not that different from where we've been. And I think it's going to -- we're going to stay very focused to get the investment grade back and growing the business at the same time. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay, appreciate the thoughts. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Joseph DeNardi : Thanks. Good morning. Ed, in response to Mike's question, you said, I think based on your time with Steve, that the Delta card with Amex is highest value, like what do you mean by that, are you trying to say that it's a very profitable card for Amex as well are their most profitable card? Ed Bastian : No, I don't know if it's the most profitable. I hope we are. You'd have to ask Steve that. But what I can tell you is it creates the highest overall level of spend and growth in the portfolio. And it's been that way for some time and it continues, and we both continue to invest to keep it that way. Joseph DeNardi : Okay, okay. And then Gary, you said the fleet actions would allow you to add seven points to ASM by 2023. So what level of ASM production are you on track to kind of achieve in 2023, I know there's a lot of flexibility, but does the current fleet support 100% of 2019 capacity in 2023 -- where are you now with that? Thank you. Gary Chase : Yeah, Joe we'll talk more about that and what our long term capital needs will be in December with you. What I was pointing out was the portfolio decisions that we've made gives us seven points of additional capacity that we can bring in that timeframe. And, just continue to point out that the team has positioned us with a tremendous amount of flexibility to go either up or down, depending on how we see the demand environment. But we'll have more color on that with a bigger picture about how some of the other components play into it as well. Joseph DeNardi : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna International. Chris Stathoulopoulos : Good morning, thanks for taking my question. So your marginal cost per mile in 3Q was just under $0.04 and it's picking up sequentially, significantly. And I realized that, as you said, you're spooling up capacity here but I was wondering at what point whether it's in ASM or revenue where we can expect to see this operating leverage for the costs that you've taken out over the last year or so more clearly show up in results? Normalizing for the change in your marginal cost per mile, from the second to the third quarter as you spool up here, what are kind of a more accurate run rate looks like and that would also assuming corporate does return as you expect by the end of the year? Glen Hauenstein : Chris, on an underlying basis we still have and are experiencing a lot of leverage, even as we move into the third quarter. That will be the case for a good bit here. The guidance we have in the third quarter, we're still operating 28% to 30%, below where we were in 2019. So there are parts of the system where we were under pressure as Ed described, and we're absolutely meeting the needs there. But there are also lots of opportunities for us to drive that leverage. Some of what you're seeing in terms of the moving pieces are at least I think unrelated to that. A big cost pressure as we've moved from the second to the third quarter, at least a couple points which is selling related expense, so obviously thrilled to be seen. And it's just a function of the demand recovery that we're experiencing. Normally when we're in a typical year, we work very hard to not be maintaining aircraft during the peak summer months for obvious reasons, we want them flying and generating contributions. This year we've got a maintenance step up as we move from the second to the third quarter. In fact, I think when you look at third quarter maintenance, it'll be comparable to if not even slightly ahead of where we were in 2019 instead of the down 30ish% that you've been seeing over the last few quarters. So, it's a year with a lot of unique features in terms of how they play out on the cost side, but the fundamental leverage that we've been describing is there. Julie Stewart : And now we'll go to our final analyst questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Andrew Didora : Great. Good morning, everyone. Just kind of wanted to go back to costs. Obviously, the labor market is very tight right now. And I think your last base pay increase was in October of 2019. To Gary, is there anything in your 3Q or 4Q CASM expectations for a wage increase? And I guess Ed, how are you thinking about the need for one right now? Gary Chase : Thanks Andrew, we don't preannounce what we're doing on our labor strategy and cost. And obviously, our people are working really hard and delivering great value. We're still losing money. We need to get the company stabilized first before we start talking about wage increases. Andrew Didora : Okay. And then last one for Ed, not sure if you're going to have any comments on this. But the last thing of last week, the President issued an executive order and he just called out slot administration as one of the objectives. What do you think this means just given your position in a pretty stock constrained market here in New York, just love to hear if you have any comments on that? Thanks. Ed Bastian : I really don't. Well, we'll study. We'll talk to the administration and Department of Transportation and Secretary [indiscernible] and many individuals about it. We have a long history of driving great value for customers. It's expensive to drive great value, and we're making the investments to drive great value. There's no question when you think about the level of service, the quality of service, the reliability, the affordability, everything's moving in the right direction. So we're thrilled to be able to show them the actual results of what we're doing. Julie Stewart : That will wrap up the analysts\u2019 portion of our call. I'll now turn it over to Tim Mapes, our Chief Marketing and Communications Officer to start the media questions. Tim Mapes : Well good morning to all the members of the media. Thank you for your time this morning. We're grateful for that. And Katie, if you wouldn't mind reiterating for the members of the media the rules of asking a question with one follow up, please. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Mary Schlangenstein : While planning for the rest of the year if you can talk about the numbers versus that percentage, increase that will be and then also if you'll comment on whether you're having any trouble finding enough people to hire? Ed Bastian : Mary, this is Ed. We missed the first part of your question. Could you repeat that? Mary Schlangenstein : Yes, I wondered if you could say how many employees you're going to add the number versus that percentage increase? Ed Bastian : Over the course of this year, we're in the process of hiring between 4000 and 5000. Mary Schlangenstein : And are you having any trouble finding applicants for those jobs? Ed Bastian : We are not. The Delta brand is a very strong hiring brand. We're having great success. The challenge as I mentioned on the call is the training, the time it takes to get people in position, whether it's on the phones in reservations or in the airports. It takes a few months and the demand has come back in such a fast clip. It's taken us all a little bit of time to catch our breath. But we'll be fully back over the next couple of months and providing -- we've been providing great service, but the service levels that customers should expect and deserve you'll be getting back from Delta in the next couple of months. Mary Schlangenstein : Okay, and have your flight operations been affected at all in terms of lack of flight crews? Ed Bastian : Not at all. Not at all. We've been managing the best completion factor in the industry and it's not even close. Our team is doing a good job. We've been at this for over a year, managing the training queue and the training pipeline, and our pilots and our maintenance team are doing great. Mary Schlangenstein : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tracy Rucinski with Reuters. Tracy Rucinski : Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you have any updates on your plans for the trainer refinery, and particularly on the outstanding liability on the biofuel credits? Glen Hauenstein : Tracy, we don't have any -- anything any news. In that regard we continue to operate, train or the team does a very nice job there. We have said in the past that there are opportunities to pull another strategic partner in, we'd be open to that. Relative to the question around RINs, we are fully accrued. So I know there's been some discussion in the press about whether we pulled away from acquiring RINs, we just know the pricing of RINs is not a market based price at the present time. And we're not going to spend good cash chasing a fairly marketplace that isn't transparent. So we've accrued the costs but we have time to decide as we settle those obligations over the next couple of years. Tracy Rucinski : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Koenig with the Associated Press. David Koenig : Oh, hi. Well, Mary asked my question but if I could kind of follow up, I know, Ed, you said that it's too early to raise wages but what about starting pay, are you having to raise starting pay to attract people or do anything else out of the ordinary to find those 4000 to 5000? Ed Bastian : It's interesting Dave, we've looked at potentially hiring bonuses and other incentives. And largely we haven't needed to resort to that. People look at the Delta brand as a place they want to be long term and they see this as an opportunity to get inside Delta. So no, we haven't had to make any changes to scale. We always watch it, we're very competitive in the market, we pay well, our people, we take great care of them. But no, we haven't had to adjust our salary scales in any in any meaningful way. David Koenig : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dawn Gilbertson with USA Today. Dawn Gilbertson : Hi, good morning. My questions are about the customer service wait times. They still are as long as six hours at least as recently as yesterday. So I'm wondering from a travelers perspective, is there any end in sight? I've also noticed that you guys have temporarily suspended help through Twitter DM which is a frequent recommendation I and other travel reporters give. So is there any end in sight, and what's your best advice for people to reaching Delta, especially with last minute travel questions? Thank you. Well, Ed Bastian : Thanks. Thanks Dawn, this is Ed we are hiring a couple 1000 people into reservations. We've already hired at least half that number. We've got more to go every single week with more and more people are getting on the phones. We've reached out to many of the people at reservations who have retired as we had separation packages and voluntary departure packages over the last year. We have a fair number of them that returned, they are on the phones. We have people working from home. It's not a question of not providing the staff and we are doing everything we can the volumes are beyond anything we've ever seen there beyond the high point of 2019. And the handling times are substantially longer as people have more questions, as travel has changed, it is the first time back., So we're incredibly sensitive to it. The number you mentioned is not the average number at all. Yes, there are still rare occurrences of that. We have the callback features in place. We manage every one of the Qs, whether it's the General SkyMiles Q, the premium Qs, the non member Qs. And we're all at the longest the average we're seeing is in the one hour time frame. Which, by the -- wait way, which is, by the way too long, and by September we expect to get that back down to normal levels. Dawn Gilbertson : Could somebody come in or get back to me on the Twitter DM, because you guys appear to be the only one of the major Airlines that's temporarily not responding via DM? Ed Bastian : Yeah, I'm not sure about that. We'll get back to you. Dawn Gilbertson : Thank you. Ed Bastian : And by the way, people email me every day, every hour. That's a good way. Somebody needs help just send me a note, I will take care of it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Leslie Joseph with CNBC. Leslie Joseph : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. For the employees that are coming in now that you're hiring, are they on average at lower wages than some of the people that left with a lot of senior people took retirement? And then also for the 20% of employees that are not vaccinated or there are certain work groups that's concentrated in, are you doing anything to increase vaccination rates across the company? Ed Bastian : Your first question, Leslie, yes the starting rates of people join the company are clearly lower than the then the rates that people retired at as they left the company after 25, 30, 40 years of service. So we are getting a juniority benefit in the scale. We're giving a lot of people, a lot of our particularly our young managers who are having opportunities to take on more responsibility and growth in their careers. And that's all very, very healthy. Your question around vaccinations the 28%, could you repeat that? Leslie Joseph : What are you doing to increase that vaccination rate across the company? And do you see that it's concentrated in any one work group or geography or the best access information? Ed Bastian : Listen 72% candidly we're proud of it. It beats any national average by a meaningful amount. We do have pockets within the company in certain regions and certain demographics that are below 72% and we are doing everything we can to continue to encourage and incent. We provided $1 million last month in total awards to vaccinated employees. They are 40 different drawings of $25,000 a piece. I think we have one more drawing today that we have of anyone that's just been newly vaccinated within the last month. To win $25,000 we've given away free travel to employees through drawings that can get vaccinated. And we continue to describe the risks to individuals if they're not vaccinated from the variance. So I don't know a company is doing more to get its team vaccinated than Delta. Leslie Joseph : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alison Sider with Wall Street Journal. Alison Sider : Hi. Thank you so much. I'm just curious what you are hearing about the math command on planes if you think it will be listed in September. And I guess how you feel about that if you are hoping it will be listed earlier or if you like to get extended? Ed Bastian : Hi, Ali. I don't know what's going to happen. It's up to the FEA. It's not really up to the Airlines to make that decision. We will be in conversations clearly with the FEA. I think it's important that medical experts make those decisions, not airline professionals as we've learned through the pandemic. They're the ones that have all the insight and the information, and keeping people safe. I appreciate people not wanting to wear the mask. I don't like wearing the mask when I'm on board either, but it's something that we need to do to keep each other safe. And I think the other question about what's going to happen in September. It really depends on where we are in the recovery phase. If the variants are continuing, I think people are going to be a little more careful about lifting the masks. If international borders are not yet opened, I'm not sure lifting the mask is going to help opening up those borders. So there's a lot that goes into that and I think as many pros to take the mask requirement as there are to keeping it on at the present time. Alison Sider : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my call or my question. I had a question about the federal payroll support and whether based on the arguments Delta management made last year, if you still believe that the support was facilitate faster recovery, protecting jobs? And the second part of my question is what happens after October first weather and what burning off the expiration of support will mean or burning off the expiration of support will mean for Delta's earnings? Ed Bastian : Well, I think it's without debate that the federal support was critical to keeping our industry afloat and keeping our employees employed and being in position for the recovery. As we've talked on this call, one of the biggest challenges we're having now is getting everything fully stood up, even though we've kept all of our employees. So you can imagine if we had to actually let many people go and abandon those individuals, the challenges we'd be facing in our country of getting travel moving again. So I think it's been an incredible success. One can debate the length of the PSP2 and PSP3. I see no interest in going beyond what we have at the present time with PSP3, and we expect to be profitable in Q3 and beyond without any PSP support. Yes. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Tim Mapes : Katie we have time for one final question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from David Slotnick with TPG. David Slotnick : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about what you've seen in the last few weeks with unruly passengers. Has there been any upward or downward trending in incidents of that, and do you have any thoughts on just what's been causing this sort of search this spring and early summer? Ed Bastian : You know, David, we haven't seen any meaningful shifts. It's been something we've been dealing with over the course of the Pandemic. Some people want to related to having to wear masks. I'm sure that's a piece of it. I don't know that's the main piece. I think the bigger challenge is that we've got a lot of individuals that have been impacted. Their emotional wellbeing have been impacted during the pandemic. It has people are coming back out into society. You see challenges in all walks of life, not just our industry. You see it happening in other places as well in society. So obviously, social media amplifies that and puts it on a stage that's not our experience. That's not our normal experience by any means. Their crews are trained and they're incredibly professional in managing the conditions when we have someone who doesn't want to follow instructions of the crew. And unfortunately, something we've become good at. And I look forward to the return of our business and patterns of normalcy so that we can start to manage our business without having to worry about these effects. Glen Hauenstein : Patterns of normalcy, it's a good way to put it. Thank you. Tim Mapes : Thank you for the question, David. And thank you to all the members of the media for your time this morning. As we wrap up, we'll turn it over to Ed for final comments. Ed Bastian : Well, I thank you all for joining us. It's been an hour and a half. We spent a fair bit of time with you, but hopefully you've learned a lot as to why we're encouraged. And as we power our plan for the post pandemic future, why that I'm and our team is as optimistic as ever for the journey that we're on. U.S. Travelers are returning and it's really a tribute to the incredible work of our scientific community in developing effective vaccines. And that's going to be key to opening the world or return to profitability in the month of June is a major milestone. Solid profitability close to 10% speaks to the strength of our brand and the great work of our team worldwide. As we move past this inflection point from crisis into restoration, the people of Delta will be front and center, serving our customers and our communities. Our mission of connecting the people of the globe is a noble one. It's an important one. It's got great purpose and the social good that's generated by travel will be essential in the months and years ahead as our world heals. So I thank you all for your time today for joining us. And one more time, I want to say a special thanks to all the Delta people worldwide for their great work over the course of this last 16 months in getting our business to a point where we're looking to bright skies ahead. So thank you all. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

My name is Jenn and I will be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Julie Stewart : Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us for our September quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining us from Atlanta today are CEO Ed Bastian, our President, Glen Hauenstein, our CFO, Dan Janki, and Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta's performance and strategy. Glen will provide an update on the revenue environment and our brand momentum, and Dan will discuss costs suite in our balance sheet. Similar to last quarter's call, we scheduled today's call for 90 minutes to make sure we have plenty of time for questions. For analysts, we ask you please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up so that we can get to as many analysts as possible. After the analyst Q&A, we will move to our media questions after which Ed will provide a brief closing statement. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's sec filings. We also discussed non-GAAP financial measures in all results exclude special items, unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures, on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ed. Ed Bastian : Thank you, Julie. And good morning, everyone. Appreciate you joining us this morning. The September Quarter marked another important milestone in our recovery. We achieved our First Quarterly profit since the start of the pandemic with the pre-tax results of $216 million and a pre-tax margin of nearly 3%, despite still missing 1/3 of our revenue base compared to the same period in 2019. We saw a full return of domestic consumer travel to 2019 levels, as our customers safely returned to the skies and our people delivered industry-leading operational performance through a very busy summer once again, showing why they are the best in the business. I want to thank every member of the Delta team for your hard work and dedication during a truly historic summer where we faced the challenges of standing up our operation after such unprecedented disruption.  I'd also like to recognize the Delta teams who played a central role in transporting 10,000 Afghan refugees that were evacuated from harms way in Afghanistan over the last couple of months and delivering needed supplies. It was an amazing effort that involved everyone from Delta's flight crews to operations control, to government affairs, to our charter and fleet team. Our revenue recovery in the September quarter reached 66% of 2019 levels, progressing from 51% in the June quarter and just 25% at the start of this year. This was led by strong consumer demand, growing improvement in business and international travel, and reflected the resilience of some of our diverse revenue streams which are already back to or higher than pre-pandemic levels. While the recovery in business travel paused in August and early September as case counts increased, demand has picked up since Labor Day. Last week was our top corporate revenue booking week since the start of the pandemic. And with the announcement that U.S. borders will open in November, bookings from Europe and Brazil to the U.S. are rapidly improving. The third-quarter results reflect Delta's differentiated position in the industry, and a continued focus on executing our customer-centric strategy. The strategy is rooted in providing best-in-class service to our customers, strengthening preference for our brand, and while at the same time, creating a simpler, more efficient operation. At the heart of our brand promise, is operational reliability. Restoring our operations safely and reliable -- reliably with a strong commitment to cleanliness remains our top priority. And we're proud to be leading the industry in all key operational metrics, through the summer, as well as year-to-date. One important indicator is what we call brand-perfect days. Those days when we don't experience a single cancellation across our mainline and regional operations. I'm happy to report that we have delivered 116 brand-perfect days in 2021, which are on par with pre-pandemic levels as our people are delivering outstanding reliability. We're delivering on our commitment not just to return our service levels to pre-pandemic performance, but to exceed those levels by the end of this year. A key component is staffing, and we have added 8,000 people to the Delta team this year. This new talent is helping us build the airline of the future, which includes a focus on improving diversity and representation across all levels of our workforce.  Our culture of putting our people and our customers first, is building stronger preference for the Delta brand. At its core, the Delta brand stands for connection, creating unique relationships with our customers, driving strong engagement, higher loyalty, and a sustained revenue premium to the industry. More customers are engaging with Delta than ever before, driving record downloads of our Fly Delta app and record sign-ups for our SkyMiles Loyalty Program. Our Delta American Express co-brand program continues to show strong resilience with card acquisitions nearly 95% restored and card spend 115% recovered to 2019 levels. As a result, remuneration from American Express in the September quarter exceeded 2019 levels, totaling just over a billion dollars in the quarter. Demonstrating the durability of our brand preference as we continue to deepen our customer relationships. Our revenue premium and our customer satisfaction has not just endured, but it's strengthened through the pandemic with both above 2019 levels. These outcomes are a true validation of our customer-centric strategy, and people-first approach. Same time, we're also building a simpler, more efficient airline. As we rescale the operations and refresh our fleet, we will unlock efficiency gains while also improving our product and customer experience. Dan will speak more about our fleet strategy and cost outlook shortly. As we look ahead, it's clear that the recovery will continue to be choppy, but we see a number of encouraging trends. Restoring the remaining 1/3 of our revenue base is dependent on further business and international demand improvement. In the September Quarter, domestic corporate volume was 40% recovered, up 10 points from the June quarter. With the spiking case counts, delaying office re-openings, we did not see the progression we had expected at the start of the quarter, particularly after Labor Day. But as the variant recedes, business travel has picked up over the last month, with volumes now reaching the highest level we've seen in the recovery. In the last week our domestic business volume was close to 50% restored. We expect continued improvement as offices reopen at the start of the new year. And we anticipate meaningful acceleration in business travel starting at that point. We hear regularly from our corporate customers that they're ready to get back to travel, see their clients face-to-face, to renew business relationships and develop new ones. That sentiment is coming through loud and clear in our most recent corporate surveys. More than 90% of our respondents mentioned that they expect travel volumes in the December quarter to either be the same or outpace September quarter. Nearly 60% of our accounts are telling us that they've already reopened their offices with an additional 10% expected to open their offices before year-end. We are also seeing improving trends internationally spurred by the decision to lift 212(f). This decision marks a critical moment in our road to international recovery, And we thank the Biden administration and our supporters in Washington, for their work to reopen travel to the U.S. Thanks to this important policy change, many families are going to be reunited this holiday season for the first time in almost 2 years. Against this backdrop, we anticipate our revenue momentum to show good progress through the December quarter, finishing the month of November and December combined, had a 75% recovery. This 10 point improvement from current levels is driven by offices reopening, international restrictions easing, and our expectation that consumer strength continues into the holidays. So putting the year in context, we started at only 25% of our business restored, total business for the Company. And we'll end the year at 75% restored. While choppy, there is a clear underlying momentum in our Company that gives us optimism, as we go into '22. As those fundamentals improve, we also see fuel prices continue to rise, which will pressure our ability to remain profitable in the December quarter. At present time, we're expecting a modest loss in the fourth quarter with crude prices driving that up nearly 60% year-to-date and more than 15% just over the last month. While we operate in a volatile and uncertain environment, I have the utmost confidence in our return to sustained profitability as the recovery progresses into the new year. As we continue to restore our airline, our actions are guided by three near-term priorities. First, to deliver for our customers, providing the great service excellence they expect from Delta. We've worked hard to get our staffing levels in place, reducing wait times at our reservation centers, improved self-service options, the return of food and beverage options on board, upgraded Wi-Fi and in-flight entertainment, and the full reopening of our Delta sky club network in July of 2021. We continue to deliver on the need for flexibility with policy changes in extension of medallion status and SkyMiles benefits into 2023 to give our most loyal customers more flexibility as travel resumes. Our next priority is to re-scale our airline efficiently and reliably. We're remaining disciplined about how we're rebuilding our network, prioritizing operations, and matching our supply with demand. A measured approach to restoring capacity is critical to delivering for our customers and to managing through an environment of rising fuel prices. Finally, we're preparing for the future to position Delta for success in the next leg of the recovery and beyond. While restoring capacity in a measured way, we are growing share in key markets with high-value customers. We're making smart investments in our business to elevate the customer experience. That includes technology to enable efficiency and improve our digital capabilities while accelerating construction projects in key airports like LAX, LaGuardia, and JFK. On the balance sheet, we're focused on returning to our investment-grade metrics, having experienced firsthand just how important was to have a strong balance sheet as we entered the pandemic. We're advancing our fleet renewal and opportunistically acquiring aircraft while maintaining flexibility, try to engage an efficiency that we expect will improve our long-term cost structure and our carbon footprint. Our commitment to being a carbon-neutral airline globally differentiates us as we know, the customers are choosing brands that they believe in, and employees are looking to work for a Company that's dedicated to a sustainable future. Carbon neutrality is a fundamental part of our mission, and a meaningful step that we can take right now to protect our world for generations to come. We've recently announced our commitment to work with the Science Based Targets initiative to set a net 0 of 2050 target and an interim emissions intensity target for our airline operations in line with the Paris Agreement. This quarter, Delta also announced a 250 million gallon off-take agreement for sustainable aviation fuel on our road to a 10% SAF consumption level by 2030. We also announced plans to joined several coalitions, including The Leaf Coalition, The World Economic Forums, Clean Skies Tomorrow, and the UN led Race to Zero. You'll be hearing more about all of these efforts at our Capital Markets Day on December 16th in New York. The power of our purpose-driven brand, our people, and our strategy position Delta incredibly well for the future. We're building on a strong foundation to extend Delta 's leadership position in the years to come, and drive long-term value for all of our stakeholders, our people, our customers, our owners, and our communities where we live, work and serve. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Glen. Glen Hauenstein : Well, thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone. Generating a profit for the quarter, even with the third of our revenue still to come, is a great achievement and is another important milestone as we continue down the path of recovery. Over the last 18 months, we have stayed true to our core strengths in our commitment to the customer, from improving our position in key markets to growing Infinity with our high-value customers, to driving outperformance in premium products and diverse revenue streams, we are extending our competitive advantages. The September quarter started out strong and consumer demand environment remained robust throughout the quarter. We had a profitable summer in Europe as vaccinated U.S. tourists were welcome back to the continent. With the variant taking hold in early August, we saw a temporary pause in demand, especially business travel as many companies delayed office reopening plans. Despite the variance impact, we remain within our initial guidance range with revenues coming in at down 33.8% versus 2019 or 2/3 restored. This represented a 1.9 billion sequential improvement in total revenue to 8.3 billion. Total unit revenue improved 17% versus the June quarter, on an 11-point improvement in load factor and a 4% improvement in yield. Since Labor Day, we've seen improvement in demand with daily cash sales growing each week. Domestic Consumer revenue remains fully recovered to 2019 levels. And we are seeing continued improvement in domestic corporate sold revenue, which as Ed mentioned, is at the highest level we've seen during the recovery. We expect continued improvement throughout this quarter. On the international front, we continue to see positive trends led by Latin with passenger revenues 84% recovered versus 2019, a 20-point sequential improvement driven by leisure traffic to beach markets. Transatlantic recovery improved by 20 points versus the June quarter to 35% recovered versus the September quarter of 2019. With corporate sales and this entity, now nearly 30% restored. We are also encouraged by the administration's recent decision to lift to 212 F restrictions. Following the announcement, Europe point-of-sale bookings for November and December are more than six times what they had been pre this announcement. As we progress through the last few months of the year, we expect strong results for Thanksgiving and Christmas. The month of October is impacted by the lingering impact of the variant, resulting in an expectation that revenue will be approximately 65% recovered. But as we move into November and December, the sunset of 212 apps and a higher mix of consumer traffic, we are expected to support revenue recovery of the 75% range to 2019 levels. With these monthly trends, we expect a percentage of revenue recovery in the low 70's for the December quarter. Consistent with our disciplined approach on matching capacity to the emerging demand environment, we expect our December quarter capacity to be approximately 80% of 2019 levels. Balancing the restoration of our capacity with demand remains a strategic priority for Delta and is more important than ever given the uneven recovery and the increase in fuel prices. While fuel is a near-term headwind for our results, we expect to recapture higher fuel in the medium to long run as we return to a more historical correlation between fuel prices and revenue. As we look to '22, we plan to progress our network restoration in line with demand. We have the ability to achieve 2019 capacity levels by the second half of next year. In addition to this quarter's financial results, there are several other accomplishments that we're very proud of. Our premium products continue to outperform. During the quarter, premium revenue in domestic in short-haul latent outperform the main cabin by approximately 10 points, as paid load factors and comfort plus and first-class cabins exceeded 2019 levels. This is a great validation of our premium strategy, especially given the higher mix of consumer demand. Our diverse revenue streams remain resilient. Other revenue in the quarter was 91% recovered to 2019 levels. Within that category, Loyalty revenues are more than 80% restored, supported by strong card spending in acquisition trends. Cargo revenue, which we expect it will continue to grow and enhance our future international profitability, was nearly 40% higher despite flying less than half of our wide-body international flights compared to the same period of 2019. And MRO revenue was more than 90% recovered on increased engine volume. Our conservative approach to restoring capacity combined with the strength of our premium products and the resilience of our diversified revenue streams, resulted in a unit revenue premium relative to the industry throughout the pandemic. As we closed the books on September quarter, we expect that trend to continue with our unit revenue premium relative to the industry exceeding our highest 3rd quarter on record, even with business and international, less than 50% recovered. This result validates a basic but powerful premise. Putting the customer at the center of everything that we do, and pursuing diverse revenue streams translates into a sustained revenue premium. As consumers returned to the skies, we've been focused on increasing stability and trust. We're also reducing friction points by eliminating change fees, enhancing self-service options, and developing our Flex product that provides full refundability for those that value flexibility the most. We're progressing towards a fleet that is more cost-efficient and fuel-efficient and one that offers even better onboard experience with a higher mix of premium seats and enhanced Wi-Fi and IFP products. Enhancing the customer experience doesn't stop onboard our aircraft. It also extends to the experience on the ground. We're accelerating investments in our airports and continuing to innovate. In Atlanta, we're launching digital ID, allowing customers to rely on facial recognition to create a seamless airport experience from check-in to boarding. And we're investing in our sky clubs included -- including two of our largest clubs in Los Angeles and Laguardia, scheduled to open in March and April of '22. As Ed mentioned, we are seeing strong consumer engagement and growing brand preference. More customers are choosing our digital channels, which are highly effective selling and self-service platforms. For example, our Fly Delta app downloads reached a record in the September quarter, up 25% versus 2019, with monthly downloads now surpassing 1 million for the first time ever. Buyer digital engagement is fueling growth in our SkyMiles program, which secured the number one spot against all global airlines in the U.S. news ranking of all airline loyalty programs. Congratulations to our customer engagement and loyalty team on this great accomplishment. Customers are joining SkyMiles at a faster rate than the passenger recovery. For the quarter our SkyMiles acquisitions were more than 100% recovered relative to 2019. And finally, our co-brand program continues to show resilience, and drive tremendous value for both our Delta and our partner, American Express. And importantly to our highest value customers. We're seeing more demand for our premium co-brand credit cards with both new and existing cardholders, as more customers are increasing, seeing the value proposition. Our well-defined improvement strategy of focusing on the customer, positions Delta well, for many years ahead. Key to our success is the fact that we have the best people in the industry, delivering on our brand promise to our customers every single day. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dan. Dan Janki : Great. Thank you, Glen. The teams world-class capability and continued commitment to delivering best-in-class service and reliability certainly sets the foundation for our financial success, and this quarter was no exception. The Delta people continue to execute well through a dynamic environment. Across our teams, we are focused on preparing the operations for the next leg of the recovery, taking the steps required to position Delta for the future, where we build upon our industry leadership position in the years ahead. Let me start with a few highlights for the September quarter. Even with the pause in the pace of recovery, we achieved our goal of profitability for the current quarter with earnings-per-share of $0.30, pretax profit of 216 million, and margin nearly 3%, and revenue of 8.3 billion. Total third-quarter operating expense was $7.8 billion. That was a 12% increase from second Quarter, driven primarily by non-fuel costs from the continued restoration of the airline. Fuel expense, $1.5 billion increased 5% sequentially as lower fuel prices, partly offset by 11% increasing capacity versus second quarter. Adjusted fuel price per gallon was $1.94, was 8% lower than second quarter, driven by refinery contribution versus a loss in the second quarter. We realized 4% fuel efficiency versus same period in 2019 as we continue to capture benefits of our fleet renewal. Non-fuel costs of $6.3 billion increased 14% sequentially. That was on revenue growth of 30% driven by higher capacity, double-digit improvement in load factors. We saw a step-up in costs in the quarter to support the operational performance, higher revenue capacitor volumes while we positioned for further demand recovery. The impact of these costs combined with a network that was 30% smaller, resulted in September Quarter non-fuel CASM 15% higher than 2019. Now, moving to cash flow and the balance sheet. The September quarter operating cash flow was 151 million. We ended September with 19.3 billion of adjusted net debt. The pause in the paces are recovery along with seasonality as we transitioned out of the peak summer, resulted in a sequential decline in our air traffic liability balance of 562 million to 6.4 billion. We expect the air traffic liability will begin to build as we enter 2022 as travel restrictions ease and more customers begin to make plans for the spring and summer season. Balance sheet management remains a priority, as we chart our return to investment grade metrics in the coming years. During the September quarter, we used excess cash to reduce gross debt and interest expense, while rebuilding unencumbered assets and managing our debt maturity profile. This includes the execution of a billion-dollar tender offer, paying cash for the majority of our aircraft, and commencing $500 million of incremental debt reduction initiatives, over the last 12 months, we've reduced our financial obligations by $12 billion. These actions drive interest savings, fund our pension, and smooth our debt maturity profile. Now, turning to capital and fleet. We invested nearly 620 million of Capex in the September quarter. That was below our guidance of 800 million due to timing of used aircraft delivery. Our full-year 2021 gross Capex is unchanged at $3.2 billion. On the fleet, we continued to build on our progress to transform and gauge our fleet to be simpler and more efficient, being opportunistic while maintaining flexibility to adjust to the shape of the recovery is a priority. In 2020, we accelerated our fleet renewal with a retirement of over 200 aircraft and elimination of 2 fleet families. We also deferred deliveries worth more than $5 billion, resulting in lower planned Capex in 2020 and 2021. To capitalize on the recovery and replace retired aircraft in a capital disciplined manner. We converted a total of 55 A321 NEO options to firm orders, with delivery scheduled between 2022 and 2027, and opportunistically entered into agreements acquired 38 gently used aircraft at compelling economics, two of which we announced today. Our decisions are guided by a fleet strategy, focused on simplification, scale within our fleet types, higher gauge and sustainability. The simplification and revitalization of fleet, driving permanent change in our cost structure, with benefits estimated to be around $400 million in 2021 and around $650 million in 2022. This is compared to 2019. These savings will continue to scale in future years as we take to delivery of next-generation aircraft, restore flying volumes, and further simplify the fleet. With these actions, we are unlocking efficiency gains, while also improving the product and customer experience. By next summer, nearly half our narrow-body seats will be produced by larger gauge aircraft, our most profitable fleet category. This is an improvement of 10 points versus 2019. Our wide-body fleet next-generation aircraft will make up 25% of our fleet by next summer. The 15 point improvement versus 2019, that will drive efficiency gains, premium product enhancements, and expanded cargo capability. Now, turning to the fourth quarter, we expect the modest loss as the recent rise in fuel prices will pressure our ability to remain profitable in the current quarter. Adjusted fuel price per gallon is expected to be between $2.25 to $2.40. This represents an increase of nearly $0.40 per gallon from the September quarter, as market prices have moved up sharply. Mind you, a $0.05 movement in fuel, equates to roughly $40 million of expense. Fuel efficiency is expected to be approximately 4% better than the December quarter in 2019. Non fuel costs are expected to increase 2% to 4% sequentially, as we incur people-related costs to prepare our operations for the acceleration in demand covering in 2022. Non-fuel CASM is expected to be 6% to 8% higher to 2019 in the fourth quarter. When comparing to 2019, our Nonfuel CASM profile is impacted by the cost required to restore our operations, and how we're applying our network. As we rebuild, additional maintenance and training costs are required to prepare our fleet and our crews to fly a larger schedule next summer. These costs will continue into next year. The size of the network and the deployment of the fleet are also contributing factors from a scale perspective, our network is 20% smaller in the fourth quarter compared to 2019. Our mix that we're flying is also different. We have less long-haul international capacity, which is structurally low CASM given long stage late nature of that flying. Until we are more fully restored, we expect non-fuel CASM to be above 2019 levels. As our operations normalized. I'm confident in our ability to drive operating leverage and recognize the benefit from our fleet renewal. As we look to 2022, we are optimistic about the continued demand recovery and are prioritizing driving margins, profitability, and restoring our balance sheet. I look forward to building on team strong track record of financial discipline and balanced capital allocation and sharing more with you on a long-term expectations, and goals of our Capital Markets Day in December in New York. In closing, as I continue to spend time with the Delta people, my conviction, our future only grow stronger. During my first 90 days, I've been most impressed with the teams resounded commitment to our employees and our customers which comes through in every action I have across our operations. It's clear to me that there's something truly special about the Delta family. I want to echo Ed's and Glen's sentiment, thank all my Delta colleagues for everything that they do to carry out our mission, to bring people together and connect the world. With absolutely the best employees in the business, a clear focus on the customer and continued financial discipline, I'm confident we are positioned to create long-term value for all our stakeholders. Now with that, I'll turn the call back over to Julie to begin Q&A. Julie Stewart : Thanks, Dan. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up. Jen, can you please remind the analysts how to queue up for questions? Operator : Thank you. [ Operator Instructions]. And we'll go first to Jamie Baker with J.P. Morgan. Jamie Baker : Hey, good morning, everybody. First question goes potentially to Glen and Dan. So pre -COVID, I had asked Paul about the amount of time that it would typically take Delta to recalibrate the higher fuel prices. I'm not staring at the transcript, but its estimate of time was 4 to 6 months, which was an improvement from historic levels. So my question I guess for Glen, is whether the booking curve is deep enough right now that you might actually be able to recapture the top-line more quickly than that? And similarly for Dan, whether there's anything we should be thinking on the costs or operations side that could accelerate the process and basically just trying to understand whether four to six months is still the right estimate for us to be using. Glen Hauenstein : I would just comment. I think we're a bit in uncharted territory here as the recovery continues. And well, I think it might be difficult in the very short run despite the fact that the booking curve has moved in a bit, that I would estimate that 4 to 6 months is about right because we believe that demand and capacity will fall back into very good equilibrium by next spring, which would put you inside that window. Jamie Baker : Okay. All right, so no structural changes that you can identify that would greatly alter it one way or the other then? Glen Hauenstein : No. I think -- I would think that that would be where we would expect it to manifest itself in the same window. Jamie Baker : And then second question, just as it relates to the international demand that you're seeing from Europe since the Biden announcement, can you say how skewed the improvement is to the European point-of-sale. I'm just trying to reconcile some data that we have here that largely excludes euro point-of-sale, just trying to get a feel whether it's 70-30, 60-40, 80-20 something like that. Glen Hauenstein : Well, that time of year is actually -- the winter season has more European sales than summer season. So we're talking probably about more of a normal split if that's what you're asking, 60% U.S. origin, 40% European origin. And the interesting part about this is that we have seen an uptick in both sides, not just European sales. The assumption here is that there are a lot of Europeans in the U.S. that we're worried about getting back. So very nice uptake as we get to November and December beyond the 212(f) being lifted. Jamie Baker : Okay. Very helpful. Thank you, Glen. Operator : We'll go next to Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey, thanks for the time. So in terms of the cost guidance, which is where we're getting a bunch of questions this morning. Can you just bridge from the early September commentary that you'd miss being down. You're over 2 by a little. And today where you see it up, 6 to 8 on a unit basis. What are the main buckets? What changed over that call in 5, 6 weeks. Dan Janki : Let me go -- What I'd say is first number 1, capacity as we pulled down the schedule in the fourth quarter, was driver and then also the pace as it relates to the rebuild and preparing for demand for 2022. Those were the two factors that led to that. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay. And then on fleet restoration, would you put some numbers to that, perhaps? What is that in 2021? And what do you expect that to be in 2022. And do you have a sense for when we cross over from leap restoration investment to the benefits we were hearing about a while ago from fleet simplification. And thanks for taking the questions. Dan Janki : Yeah. The restoration when you think about bringing aircraft into service through 2021 to '22, we'll bring back into service 160 to 170 aircraft. And that's really the element that vast majority of that rebuild is focused on bringing those aircraft back. And then as we restore to more fully restored capacity levels to '19, that will dissipate and trail off and be transitory in nature from that perspective. Ed Bastian : Duane, this is Ed, if I could add a couple of points on the overall cost outlook. We are committed to our long-term guide and we'll talk more in December at the Capital Markets Day as to where we see costs going over the next couple of years. Clearly in our business, there is a race to try to capture the available demand and standing our business back up after an unprecedented level of disruption and ensure that we are not experiencing any kind of operational limitation in our ability to get our service levels and customer expectations met. So we put the paddle down to get the staffing in place to get our service levels back, to get the quality of performance that drives the brand premium that this Company stands for, and it may take us a few extra quarters to get down to that '19 and below levels, but that's still our goal. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay. I appreciate the thoughts. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Brandon Oglenski : Yeah. Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. And Ed, you kind of answered it there; but I guess, Dan, is it still right to be thinking 2019 costs are the benchmark here, especially just given all the wage inflation that we're seeing across the economy? Dan Janki : Yes, it's certainly a clear marker for us. We believe as we restore this airline will be at or better than 2019 cost levels. Brandon Oglenski : And so is that just literally a function of the network getting back to where you were utilizing that pre -pandemic, especially with longer-haul flying coming back? Dan Janki : Yes, there's -- certainly as we transition through this and we restore and get through the rebuilt, that will dissipate. You bring back the capacity you get that leverage. You also get the balance between the domestic and international. And then when you think about the more structural elements, the elements related to fleet simplification start to come through and you get those benefits related to that, both in fuel and fuel efficiency and also in our operating costs. Ed Bastian : Brendan, this is Ed. I can echo what Dan is saying. We've taken the opportunity over the last year to rebuild this airline back piece by piece. And we're learning a lot more, about what we want to keep forward and retain, and what parts of the business that we don't need to be retaining and some of the cost structure until there is efficiency, whether it's a catering, whether it's in our operational performance; literally every part of our G&A, every part of our operations. Hard to see when our capacity is still only at 80% or more below -- at 2019 levels. But we are very determined to make certain that we retain the value for the period of time we've just been through and that efficiency will show through. It's just going to take a little bit longer and that's why it will be really important in the Capital Markets Day that we show you the pathway to get there. Yeah. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Catherine O\u2019Brien: Hey, good morning, everyone. Maybe just one last follow-up on the cost outlook. So I think you guys have made the point clear that we probably going to see more of an ASM recovery, not only in total amount of capacity deploy but of course on a network allocation as well as you restore on the longer haul, widebody flying. But I guess just -- if we could talk a little bit more about pace. Do we need to get to a full restoration for that to occur or going from 90% to 100% recover do we suddenly see a real acceleration in the leverage you're going to get across the business or just any high-level comments on how to think about pacing as we approach that, thanks. Dan Janki : We'll give you certainly more color and put a pin on it as we go to Capital Markets Day, give you the outlook and also get more into specifics around '20 to '22 guidance when we give you that. The real thing I think to look for is the 2 elements. It's going to be bringing back -- bringing down that rebuild costs related to the fleet, and when we get that restored. And that's going to really pace pretty closely with the return of capacity. And then obviously the incremental leverage. So I think on that piece you're going to get it throughout that period of time, but it's really that getting that fleet rebuild component down. And that will happen as we progress through that period. Catherine O\u2019Brien: Okay. Got it. And then maybe just one more international. So at TNBC this morning, you noted that the Company saw a tenfold increase in international bookings following the announcement on the U.S. borders a couple of weeks ago. Can you just help us frame when we'll really start to see that momentum build in revenue? It sounds like there's some of that hitting in November-December time frame driving your more optimistic outlook on those months versus October. But are there also any early indications maybe for next spring or summer? Would love to hear when you think we're going to start to really see that show up in revenue a bit more. Thanks. Ed Bastian : Sure, Katy. Yes, we're going to see it in November and December. We're looking at a 10-point recovery improvement, just going from October to November. October, we're estimating at the 65% restoration level, which is where we've been for the last couple of months and received the jump-up in November and December. International was a piece of that, the only driver of that. Business travel is an important piece of that as we see that continuing to improve. We see in our bookings I mentioned I think on the CNBC piece this morning that just in the last week, our cash sales were up 9% week-over-week and that's a trend we've been seeing here for some period of time, steady growth.  So I think you're going to see it then. I think like we saw here in the summer, there's going to be a mad rush to -- for those that want to travel, that need to travel to get out and travel. You may see a little bit of a pause as you get into the January, February timeframe. But I think Spring and Summer is going to be another tick backup at an even higher level and I -- my view is that you're going to see, particularly for Europe, which is the biggest part of our international base, on Spring-Summer next year that look very much like the Spring-Summer which has been through here in the U.S. Catherine O\u2019Brien: Okay. Thanks for that. Operator : We go next to Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : Hey, good morning. Glen, these surveys that you say, are you asking corporate travel managers these questions or the travelers themselves? And also, how are you contingency planning if we get into late next fall and business travels up only 80% of what it was pre -COVID, what sort of contingency plans do you guys have in place? Glen Hauenstein : Well, first of all, I'll answer the first part of the question. That is a survey that goes out to travel manager. So that's their reply. Hunter Keay : Okay. Glen Hauenstein : Second, and we do other surveys that go through our SkyMiles program for frequent travelers and their return to travel. And I would say that those surveys are pretty well in sync. Clearly, consumers feeling much more confidence than business travelers in terms of their -- what they expect to fly more, but more and more, we're seeing the business component accelerate. That's pretty exciting for us. And then on contingency plans, I think we are committed to remaining incredibly flexible. We know we're not fully out of the woods yet. We know there's going to be more chop. It's not going to be a straight line out, and they'll be twists and turns. Whether it's fuel, whatever it is, that's part of our business here and we're always managing to -- the sum of all the inputs. As it relates to business travel, what I'd say we're super excited about is the fact that we were able to report a profitable quarter despite 40 -- 60% of our business travelers still not traveling. And we know that number is greater than 60 for next year, we don't know whether it's 90 [Indiscernible]. It's somewhere between ending next year, between 80 and 100. But what -- if you look underneath the hood there, I think the point that we're trying to point out is that demand for premium products is actually exceeding our coach products with the business traveler out. So I think the big epiphany for us was there's a much broader demand for this than just business travelers. And if we have to pivot to demand sets for high-end leisure to fill those seats, that [Indiscernible] is a trade-off we'll make, and I think one that we can be quite profitable with under any scenario. Hunter Keay : Okay. Ed Bastian : And if I could go some of Glen 's comments there. None of us know what the -- if the classic business travel, the volume is going to come back. Obviously in our industry, we're bold, we're optimistic that it's going to come back, plus, but I think we -- it's also safe to say it's going to come back differently. And there's going to be some level of demand erosion, no question about it. Some element of behavioral change, no question about that, but there's also new opportunities to travel. Hybrid for one gives you a very different outlook in terms of where people work, how they work.  I've spoken a lot publicly over the last number of months that video technology, not just doesn't force you to stay in your home, it actually allows you take the office with you when you're out on the road and stay connected better and many, many other reasons. So we're going to talk about that in December because we know that's a big question on a lot of people's minds as to what the future of business travel is. And I see as many bright spots coming out of this recovery as some of the demand destruction elements that video technology and other things and behavioral changes has ripped during this pandemic period. Hunter Keay : Okay. I've always thought that the lack of unions wasn't so much a cost advantage for Delta, but a service advantage. Is there a way that you can get a little bit more creative next year to push that a little bit hard to drive some favorable CASM without sacrificing the frontline morale? Could you follow me? Ed Bastian : I'm not going to comment on the benefits or lack thereof of unions. We have a union; we have a great relationship with our pilots and we have a lot of our employees are non-union. We have great relationships and great productivity from them as well. What I would tell you about our people is that they are incredible. The reason we have the revenue premium we have is not that we're necessarily smarter than anyone else. We provide the best service, the best reliability, the best product in the sky. And it's not a cost game, it's a performance game. And it drives better revenues, it also drives more productive cost efficiencies. And we talked a lot over the last few quarters here about the need to get our staffing levels back. I've mentioned this morning that we're bringing back 8,000 people, brought back 8,000 people this year. Don't forget, we had 17,000 that retired at this time a year ago. So we are getting significant flexibility and productivity from the team as we get out to the future. And well, our people will continue to lead the way. Hunter Keay : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Conor Cunningham with MKM Partners. Conor Cunningham : Hey, everyone. Thanks for the time. One issue I think people struggle with is just the baseline for capacity given the fluidity in the demand environment. You mentioned all the headwinds to revenue and higher fuel. I'm not asking for a number unless you want to give one, but how has the thought process changed towards first-half capacity over the past couple of months? I heard -- and I also heard that you made the comment about 2019 capacity being -- potential being achieved in the second half. Is that your expectation right now? Glen Hauenstein : I think we've remained very fluid throughout the entire crisis and that's our commitment to remain very fluid until we get to -- back to full restoration. We don't know exactly when that's going to be and we put the marker out there, right now we wanted to be bigger than we are quite honestly, we couldn't be. We could be a little bit maybe. But not much bigger, without risking operational performance issues, like we've seen at some of our other carriers. We want to stay where we are confident that we can actually fly the schedules that we put out there.  We think those and we talked about rebuild costs and getting people back and getting planes back. We're doing all that now in the background with the capability of achieving a 100% of 2019 sometime in the back half of next year. Whether or not as we get closer, we actually use that flexibility up or down, we'll give you more color on what those decision points are at Investor Day. But the name of the game for us right now is maintain flexibility. And as Dan alluded to, even in the quarter we're in, we're slightly below where we thought we'd be in terms of revenue production, just about 8 to 12 weeks ago. Conor Cunningham : Right. Okay. And then to follow up on Hunter's question for premium products continue to perform really well. And I guess in retrospect, it makes sense of pent-up demand and just the consumer being quest for cash. But how do you, how do you think about the premium cabin as demand starts to normalize? Do you think the changes are now like structural or is it really just too early to tell in it depends on what the demand environment is later on down the road? Glen Hauenstein : We believe they're structural and we believe that through the pandemic, we've created kind of a new class of customer, which is the high-end consumer that wants these products that maybe didn't have as much access to them because they were given to the business customer earlier in the booking process. So that's one of the things we're wrestling through as we [Indiscernible] to does our fleet accommodate the higher levels of demand? I think these are things we'll be discussing more with you at Investor Day. But we do think that there's a higher level of demand for those products moving forward. Conor Cunningham : Okay. Thank you Ed Bastian : Conor, I don't think it's only pent-up demand and consumers being flushed with cash. Consumers are looking at travel differently and they're looking at a lot of things differently in a post-pandemic world and the quality of their provider, the care which they're provider takes to them, it doesn't matter whether you're an airline, you are a hotel, or a restaurant, whatever you are, is continuing going to drive preference and drive influence at a higher level than ever before. And as we consider ourselves the premier provider of service in our country, we're going to continue to gain, hopefully, an outsized part of that share going forward. Conor Cunningham : Appreciate the thoughts. Operator : Well, the next is Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi Syth : Hey, good morning, everyone. Just a quick follow-up on Conor's question to start with. As you think about the capacity restoration, is there a difference between your narrow-body and wide-body fleet ability just given the fleet changes? Glen Hauenstein : Well the answer is yes. There is a difference. I don't know what the question is on the difference. What I would say and we'll explain this a little bit more as we have our Investor Day, but where we sit today in the inefficiencies of our wide-body fleet, we're flying a significant number of wide-bodies at a stage length that they weren't designed to fly. So for example, if you fly between Atlanta and Salt Lake City today, all of our flights are flatbed, all of our flights have premium products and all of our flights are on planes that weren't designed to go 1200,1500 miles. Not only is it driving and the opportunity of not flying that long-haul, but it's driving a higher cost structure in the existing domestic environment, which will normalize as those plans get retrenched. Now, if you ask why, they're there, they're there because when we were in the earlier parts and we were in the cash mode, we wanted to use the planes that didn't have maintenance requirements, that didn't have -- that had available pilots in them. So now as we work to the rebuild, these were all part of the rebuild cost that we've got to identify and explain a little better. But this should have a double-whammy impact improvement because you get better cost structure in the domestic environment and a heavier waiting for the lower-cost international. And they're really two distinct components that are synergistic with each other. Savi Syth : That's helpful. And if I might, you've announced quite a few, I think in Boston new markets out of Boston. I was just wondering if you could provide a little color on the growth out of Boston and just, are those plans going to in line with the pre-pandemic strategy, or is there something different or newer or different opportunity that you see out of Boston? Glen Hauenstein : I think we were clear about our intentions to be Boston's preferred airline in pre-pandemic. If you go back and listen to the calls, then it was something that was our intent and we saw some opportunities in the pandemic that availed themselves and we're believing that next summer is going to be a relatively robust demand set to Europe. So we wanted to fill out some of the big demand international markets from Boston and then some of the opportunistic markets in the pandemic for Boston business. Very happy with our -- we have a great team in Boston. They doing a phenomenal job. We have a great facility in Boston. Best in class up there. And I think when you put the suite of our products and services, it really is a winning hand for Boston. Savi Syth : Makes sense. All right. Thanks, Glen. Operator : We'll go next to Chris Stathoulopoulos with Susquehanna International. Chris Stathoulopoulos : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So as we look at the second half of next year and the expectation that you can recover to 2019 capacity levels, and drive the Nonfuel CASM X below 2019. Could you just help us and again, this is more of an Investor Day question, but we think about efficiency -- I think you said about a billion dollars off 2019, but we think about efficiency fuel initiatives and then also the change in the network with some of these longer haul markets that you're adding to come to mind [Indiscernible] out of Boston. Just how we could put some color around those buckets as we think about your CASM X into the second half of next year. Thanks. Ed Bastian : Chris, this is Ed. It's way premature to be getting into 2022. CASM X and I appreciate the interest level, we're going to give you that in a couple of months in December. We need to have a better handle first on how the recovery shapes in 22. That's going to drive our plan, but I will confirm that our goal is to get at or below 2019 levels. And once we have our scale back and once, we get the operations, restored to where we want it to be. Chris Stathoulopoulos : Okay. And just a follow-up. What is the time to restart some of these international flights with the easing of, I think, it's inbound from UK, EU, and a few other areas? Is it few weeks, or is that -- should we think about that more of as a first-quarter event? Thank you. Glen Hauenstein : Well, on the margin, we're adding back some flights into the winter schedule. But as you know, winter is never the peak season for Europe travel. So what we're really thinking is, given the lifting of these embargoes, it's going to make for a great spring and summer season next year. A lot of our rebuild costs and a lot of things we're preparing for to have our European largely intact by summer. Chris Stathoulopoulos : Thank you. Operator : The next is Dan McKenzie with Seaport Research. Dan McKenzie : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. I guess first question is for Dan, referencing some of the balance sheet investment-grade commentary, big picture. I'm just wondering if you could put a finer point on the time frame for achieving that. In the past, Delta has been able to fix its balance sheet over a five-year period. Should we be thinking five years to get to that or could you potentially get there sooner? Dan Janki : We're going to talk about the multi -- your outlook as we talked about at Capital Markets Day. Certainly, the balance here between investing in restoration of the Balance Sheet are going to be key priorities that will be multiyear. And I do think that you referenced Delta 's historical track record there. They've shown real discipline if you look at over that period of 2010 through '19 of paying down debt while still building and investing in the airline. And those philosophies will be true as we think about this going forward, and that will be certainly part of our outlook, how we balance both at investing and restoring the balance sheet and the pace of that as part of Capital Markets Day. Dan McKenzie : Okay. Understood. And then, Glen, on corporate travel being nearly 80% to 100% recovered by year-end 2022, just looking at where we're at today, can you just help us connect the dots on the various buckets of spend in the fourth quarter here. How are the small and medium-sized businesses behaving versus say the large corporates. And then if you could just help us slice that a little bit differently, internationally versus domestically. So areas of corporate travel that are lagging the recovery year versus areas or segments that are in line or doing a little bit better? Glen Hauenstein : Well, certainly on the positive side, the unmanaged travel for corporate -- for business is running between 5 and 10 points ahead of managed corporate travel. Those smaller, hungrier companies out there hitting the road sooner than maybe some of the bigger multinationals. And of course, it's more heavily weighted for domestic now, but we've seen a huge uptake with the 212(f) restrictions being lifted. Europe was about 15% restored through second and third quarter for corporates.  We've seen that double to 30% just in the last couple of weeks. So seeing a nice uptick there, as well as South -- deep South America, which was pretty much non-existent for the long-haul South America, starting to show some signs of life. And then the [Indiscernible], of course, have been the Pacific, which is still largely locked down. But we are expecting those to improve significantly as we move through here as the vaccination rates in important places for us like Korea and Japan are now approaching between 70 and 80%. So hopefully, we get some good news out of that region of the world starting in the next few months here. And that's really all the color I have at this point. Dan McKenzie : Sure. Thanks for the time you guys. Operator : Well, the next to David Vernon with Bernstein. David Vernon : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the time. I want to ask the cost question very differently. The capacity is supposed to be down 80% for 4Q. Can you give us a sense of where the operating resources are relative to 2019 in the fourth quarter? I'm just trying to think about how many crews and pilots and staff do we have who are working to produce [Indiscernible] schedule in relation to this capacity being down 20% level. Is it down in line with that, is it down less than that? Can you help us frame the productivity issue? Dan Janki : The -- I'm not sure I fully understand the essence of the question in regards to are you asking where the workforce is relative -- David Vernon : Yes. So productive capacity. If you had a 100 people producing a 100% last year, and now you're producing 80, do you have 85% of the resource from 2019 producing that 80. I'm trying to get -- understand the deleveraging that's happened because of the pull-down of capacity. Dan Janki : I think as we -- the way to think about it is when you think about productivity measures by group, as you restored, you're getting those productivity levels back and moving closer or beyond 2019. So that's whether it's in the airport, whether it's with catering or other types of activities. Those progress as you bring that back. There are also situations where we're hiring ahead to ramp up. So those are the unproductive people. That's where you're training them, you're scaling them before you inject them into the operation. And that's when you call out specifics associated therewith the rebuild. David Vernon : Yeah. I was just trying to see better sense for if you could help us frame how the negative impact of the productivity loss. Ed Bastian : Let me take a stab at this, David. We have a lot of premium pay over time. The lack of \"productivity\" given where we sit with the rapid rebuild of the airline, getting people in position, getting people ready for the future, as Dan said, just covering the operation. And so you have not only just more people than capacity relative to where we are eventually going to end up once our business is restored. But on top of that, you've got a higher level of added costs going into the current funnel to ensure that you're delivering great service and building for the future at the same time on a reduced basic capacity. So that's a big part of it. You also have the restoration costs and maintenance, and training, and other elements that are another layer and I appreciate you can't see that in the numbers broken out as clearly. But again, these are the things we're going to talk about in December at the Capital Markets Day to show you that trend line. None of us has ever been through something like this, as disruptive as this. And as it builds back, I can appreciate the questions. But we see it maybe a little more clearly over a longer period of time than looking at it in the existing quarter. David Vernon : That's helpful. Thanks. If I could just squeeze one more in there, Glen. As you think about when we should be getting back to prior period load factors? Are you expecting the airline to get back to that high '18 level in 22 or 23. How should we think about load factor recovery? Glen Hauenstein : Yeah, I think this summer we were running load factors that we're within that couple points of 2019 levels, so I would expect by next spring and summer that the industry would be back in that zone. David Vernon : Great. Thanks very much, guys. Glen Hauenstein : Thank you. Operator : Well, the next to Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Mike Linenberg : Hey, good morning, everyone. Dan, can you just walk-through kind of the primary elements on the next [Indiscernible] going from 19 billion to 22 billion subdue and to December quarter and I guess seasonality plays a role there? Glen Hauenstein : When you think about it, there's really three components related to it. One will be you work through -- right through the elements of free cash flow and the movements, right? Its earnings. It's ultimately the movement in working capital, which is the air traffic liability. And then it's ultimately Capex. So you have the guidance framework as it relates to the earnings framework. Capex, we've told you is 3.2, for the year gross Capex worth 2 billion year-to-date, say, implies 1.2% in the fourth quarter.  And then you also have the working capital movement, which is really the air traffic liability. And normally in a period of time like this, when you think about that, that would be -- that will -- might move in a more seasonal traditional time in the low teens. But as we've talked about throughout this goal, we're not necessarily in traditional, seasonal periods of time. So we would expect that to be slightly more muted than that, as it relates to movement from it. But those are really the drivers there. Mike Linenberg : Great, very helpful. And then just second question to Glen. What percent of your revenue is actually tied to government contracts. I know we have craft and we have the TSA City-Pair program and then obviously you recently moved the Afghan people and I realize maybe the revenue number is a small component. when you think about some of the good press that you've gotten from some of your government services you have to weigh that as well. So a multi-prong to ask on that place in your business. Thank you. Ed Bastian : Mike, this is Ed. I'll take a stab at that. I was just asking the same question the other day. And you've got to look at it at a 2019 level. Not necessarily at today's level, because government travel is way down, given where federal government has largely not open. When you see a lot of the offices, people aren't out on the road yet. But it's collectively in the 100s of millions of dollars for Delta on an annual basis when you consider the charters, you consider all the federal workers that do travel on Delta. We have a pretty significant share of those. When you consider the U.S. mail that we carry, it's a pretty large revenue base. Julie Stewart : We'll now go to our final analyst question. Operator : And we'll go to Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : Great, thanks for putting me in. A couple of follow-ups here. The 75% recovered for November and December, I just want to understand if that's what the booking curve is telling you now, or is that a number that you are extrapolating based on the current rate of improvement? I'm sorry. If things continue to get better here in the next 68 weeks if you can end up with a better than 75% recovered number for November and December. Glen Hauenstein : Clearly, it's both. It's what we have on hand and what we expect to get, so it's the combination of those two. Ravi Shanker : Okay. Got it. And just a follow-up on the strong mix that you're seeing in the premium cabin. You said that that was structural. A, do you see that evidence in the surveys you're doing with people post flying? What's the evidence of that? And B, once the -- once corporate and international fully come back, let's say this time next year, do you expect to be flying more premium seats than in 2019 if this bounce, you're seeing is truly structural? Glen Hauenstein : Yeah, I think both of those we're intending on answering it. Investor Day is to show you how we see this evolving and show you all the research behind why we're confident that more premium seats are a direction we want to hit. Ravi Shanker : Okay. Thank you. Julie Stewart : That will wrap up the analyst portion of the call. I will now turn it over to Tim Mapes, our Chief Marketing and Communications Officer to start the media questions. Tim Mapes : Well, good morning, everybody. Thank you to the members of the media who are gathered here today. We have about 20 minutes to wrap these. If we could just remind you one question and a quick follow-up. We'll try to cover as many of these as we can. And Jen, if you could remind everyone how to access their question. Operator : [Operator Instruction]. And we'll go first to Alison Sider with Wall Street Journal. Alison Sider : Hi, thanks so much. Just wondering -- Just given the [Indiscernible] prescriptions coming off in they're saying early November. What do you have to do between now and then, if anything, to spool up the international operation? What sorts of preparation do you have underway? Glen Hauenstein : Well, we have a -- a lot of the airplanes are still in the desert, so we're working on getting those already. We're also doing a lot of interior work. I think one of the exciting things that we want to talk more about next year is by next summer, all of our long-haul international will have our new premium economy. So that's another thing we're working on. That premium economy is really a new class. We started it in '19, we didn't get very far with it.  But by the time we come out of the pandemic in '22 to most, all of Europe will have the new premium economy seats, which is something along the lines of a little bit better than domestic first-class and a class that we're really excited about. So getting that configuration redone. Our airports are another key thing we've been working very hard on our airports whether or not it's Seattle with the international terminal. Whether or not it's Los Angeles, which should be largely complete by next summer. There's a lot of work going back into the rescaling and it really is, it's all across the airline. Ed Bastian : In LA, there's obviously we have a lot of seats for sale too. There are a lot of empty seats as we've been really only carrying close to 50% loads for much of the last year across Europe. So there's a lot of work going on, as Glen mentioned, but there's also a lot of fleets that already exist in the marketplace. Alison Sider : How are you thinking about your pipeline of pilots, longer-term over the next year, what retirements are looking like, adding what the competitive landscape is for pilot hiring going forward. Ed Bastian : Well, we're going to be hiring over the next several years. I think at the present time, we're looking at hiring a couple thousand pilots over the next 18 or so months, forward to that question. At the same time, we had a pretty considerable number retire a year ago, about 2,000. So we've got this mapped out pretty effectively. We obviously need to forecast where the international demand is going to go to ensure that we're able to supply it and have pilots in the right spot. But we're, I think, doing pretty good job of keeping our pilots and our staffing availability for crews in line with how demand is shaping up. Alison Sider : Thanks. Operator : The next Leslie Josephs with CMBC. Leslie Josephs : Hi, good morning, everyone. Just 2 quick things on your hiring. Are you seeing lower average salaries now and do you expect that to continue compared with 2019 as you ramp up? And then on the premium -- paid premium cabin, what are those pace load factors, and is this -- is with September a record and where are things trending now? Ed Bastian : I'll handle the first, and Glen can handle the second question, Leslie. On overall labor cost, yes, we are getting a nice juniority benefit as we bring in a whole new generation of employees at essentially every level of the Company. We had close to 20,000 people retire a year ago. So the top end of our most experienced -- many of our most experienced employees had chosen to retire and that's open up opportunities for younger people. So there is a benefit to that. We have not changed our hiring weight skills in order to bring people in. We're able to bring people in at our current scales and not having any issue locating great talent. Glen Hauenstein : And as it relates to the premium seats, we're selling 10 points higher than we did pre-pandemic and we always run relatively full in terms of sat load factor. But a lot of those are complimentary upgrades. But what we're seeing is people are willing to pay us for those seats. And that's why we want to create more over time. I'm not going to give away what we're going to talk about in Investor Day, but making sure that we have enough to satisfy both demands for people who are willing to pay us for them as well as having an adequate supply of complimentary upgrades for our most valuable customers. Leslie Josephs : Okay. Thanks. Do you have any number and how many people you want to hire in 2022? Ed Bastian : We haven't put that number out yet, but we'll certainly be hiring pilots, we'll be hiring flight attendants and mechanics. I'd say it\u2019d probably be the three main areas we will be hiring next year. Leslie Josephs : Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instruction] We'll go next to Ted Reed with The Points Guy. Ted Reed : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I want to ask first about Boston, your goals there. Do you have goals beyond the top 10 Atlantic and the top 20 domestic destinations? And in line with that, as for your competitors, if you're growing in Boston, don't they need to grow too, and wouldn't that be part of their case to the Justice Department that they also need to grow? Glen Hauenstein : Well, Ted, I think you know us well enough to know we're not going to comment on what we think our competitors should or could do. But I think what we see is our products suit the Boston market quite well, being a premium carrier and having Boston be a very affluent city with a huge component of corporate travel. We think that we are best suited to deliver the best products and services to the customers of Boston. And we're going to, as I said in previous calls, we don't want to be the biggest, we just want to be the most loved and the most profitable. Ted Reed : All right. Thank you. And I need to ask about the vaccine. Do you think you can get where you need to get in terms of vaccines without having a mandate at Delta, without threatening firing, can you get where you need to? Glen Hauenstein : Yeah, well, that's our goal, Ted. The goal here is to get people vaccinated. And we are on a plan to get people vaccinated. I think it's one of the reasons the order came out from the administration was they were uncomfortable that not enough companies had plans to get their people vaccinated. And we already have a plan. And the plan's working well. We're at 90% at the present time, vaccination. We expect to get to 95% as we get into November. And there'll be some exemption requests. So there undoubtedly will be a small number of people that will not be vaccinated. I think it's going to be in the 1% to 2% range, relatively small amount of people. And we'll have to assess that when the time comes. But right now, I think we're fully aligned with the intent of the EO. Ted Reed : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to David Koenig with The Associated Press. David Koenig : Hi. Somebody, I think it was Les, who already asked about the pay for new hires which I was interested in. What are you seeing in terms of how many applicants you're getting per job? And how does that compare to pre-pandemic as some of your competitors have commented on that? Glen Hauenstein : Hey, Dave. We're getting great interest in new hires coming to Delta. The flight attendants, as an illustration, we just opened up 3,000 new jobs for flight attendants. We had I think 35,000 to 40,000 applicants. We had to turn off the application portal within a week because we had so many applicants coming in for those opportunities. So we're not having issues in terms of attracting great talent. I'd say the rate of interest is comparable. Obviously, it depends on work category. Some jobs are more technical and we're having to go deeper into some pools to locate talent. But broadly speaking we're doing a great job bringing people to the company. David Koenig : That's what I was also interested in. For some of those - the technical jobs, for example, you're not having to raise pay to attract people in this labor market? Glen Hauenstein : We're not. We're not. David Koenig : Okay. Thank you very much. Tim Mapes : Thanks, Dave. Jen, we have time for one final question, please. Then we'll turn it over to Ed for closing comments. Operator : We'll go to Robert Silk with Travel Weekly. Robert Silk : Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I'm wondering if you all have received any [Indiscernible] what's the date for the reopening of Europe and these other countries, Brazil, so forth? Have you gotten any sort of guidance on that? How important is it to get that specificity soon? Glen Hauenstein : Well, I think we have a lot of intelligence on that, and it varies by country and it varies by region. So we're monitoring that very closely, and that's clearly a key component to getting international business travel back. But what I would say is that when people are able to travel, even with the tighter protocols such as testing and documentation requirements, we are seeing significant uptake in corporate travel. And I point to Europe, which is not yet reopened, yet our corporate bookings have doubled since the announcement of reopening, and we'll see exactly how that plays out as Europe does reopen in early November, how much further recovery we see there. But very encouraging. People want to travel. And as soon as they're capable of traveling and they have some certainty around it, I think we've seen it doesn't matter whether it's business or leisure, they want to get out and travel. Just to be more specific to your question though, I think it\u2019s - we don't have an exact date as to when the 212(f) is [indiscernible] - it's early November. Robert Silk : Okay. Is it important to get that date? Glen Hauenstein : Important to get the date? Absolutely. We've been asking every day. Robert Silk : Okay, thanks. Tim Mapes : Thank you. With that, we'll turn it over to Ed for final comments. Ed Bastian : Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. A lot of questions, a lot of good questions. And we look forward to taking you through our longer term strategy as we get into the Capital Markets Day in December and outline for you where we're taking this company and this brand, and I think it's a very exciting future. Also want to thank the people of Delta for the great work and the spirit of service in terms of how you took care of customers and each other over the course of a very, very challenging summer. Our team is truly the Delta difference, and we continue to be inspired by the accomplishments of the entire Delta team in this environment.  So thanks to everyone for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you in New York at the New York Stock Exchange on December, the 16th. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation today.",

My name is Cody, and I will be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Julie Stewart : Thank you, Cody. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our December quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. Joining us today from Atlanta are CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; our CFO, Dan Janki. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta\u2019s performance and strategy and Glen will provide an update on revenue and Dan will discuss cost and our balance sheet. After the prepared remarks, we will take analyst questions and we ask you please limit yourself to one question with a brief follow-up so we can get to as many of you as possible. And after the analyst Q&A, we will move to our media questions. Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta\u2019s SEC filings. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and all results exclude special items, unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I will turn the call over to Ed. Ed Bastian : Well, thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone. I really appreciate you joining us today. Before getting into the December quarter results and outlook, I want to spend a couple of minutes discussing the current environment. As everyone is aware, the Omicron variant has significantly impacted our people, our customers, and our operation as well as most parts of society over the last three weeks. The combination of the rapid spread of the variant at the peak of a strong holiday demand period and in the face of extreme winter condition in parts of the country, created some of the most difficult travel conditions that we ever remember experiencing. I am incredibly appreciative of the great work that our frontline team has done and continue to do to help our customers get to where they need to be as safely and quickly as possible, no matter the circumstances. Our teams have faced these difficulties head on, while also managing the impact of the virus in their own lives. And I want to thank every member of the Delta team for your work during a very challenging period. To our customers who have been affected, we appreciate your patience and your understanding. The good news is that over the past seven days, our operation has stabilized with Omicron-related cancellations impacting only about 1% of our flights. And since Sunday, the number of Omicron-affected cancellations are around 20 a day, out of nearly 4,000 daily flights. And in fact, yesterday, we only had two Omicron-related mainline cancellations. So, while the new variant is not done, it appears that the worst maybe behind us. Based on how quickly the case counts have risen, our medical team expects cases to peak in the U.S. over the next few days, followed by a steep decline in cases. And we are already starting to see that happen amongst our own staff. Given the high transmissibility and lower severity of Omicron, this variant is likely to mark the shift in COVID-19 from being a pandemic to a manageable and ordinary seasonal virus, which should accelerate the path to a normalized environment. When we spoke last month about Omicron as a risk at Capital Markets Day, a lot was unknown. Today, we know a lot more. And while the first 60 days of the year will be impacted, we are confident that the pace of travel recovery will resume its December trajectory as we move into President\u2019s Day weekend and a strong spring and summer travel season are ahead of us. So as we reflect on 2021, it was a year like no other for Delta. While challenging, we made significant progress in our recovery. At Capital Markets Day, we highlighted that our competitive strengths have deepened through the course of the past two years and I am extremely proud of our entire team for all their efforts. Full year revenue of $27 billion in 2021 improved nearly $11 billion or 67% from 2020, with the rate of recovery accelerating from only 25%, as measured against 2019 at the start of the year to a close of the year of nearly 80% as we exited December. This resulted in a full year 2021 pre-tax loss of $3.4 billion. And while we obviously have still much work ahead of us, our pre-tax results improved by $5.5 billion versus 2020 and included a profit of around $400 million for the second half of this year. This performance positions Delta as the only major U.S. airline to achieve second half profitability and demonstrates that we have significant momentum in the continued restoration of our financial foundation. Sharing our success is one of the pillars of Delta\u2019s culture, which is why we are happy to announce this morning a special profit sharing payment for all global employees. On February 14, the vast majority of our people will receive a payment of $1,250. This is a well-earned recognition for the incredible work they have done over the past year to move our airline through the crisis and position us for recovery. Turning to December quarter highlights and our March outlook. In the fourth quarter, we recorded a pre-tax profit of $170 million. Excluding the impact of Omicron disruptions, we estimate our profitability would have been approximately $250 million in the quarter. This was on revenue that was 74% recover to 2019 levels, up 8 points from the September quarter. We started the quarter with lingering impacts to the prior variant, but encouraged by the significant improvement in demand and pricing that we saw throughout the quarter in each of our passenger segments. Turning to the March outlook, we expect to incur pre-tax losses in the months of January and February before returning to solid profitability in the month of March. The Omicron case surge is impacting business travel and international recovery the most. As meetings are canceled, planned office reopenings are postponed and countries put restrictions back in place. On the consumer side, we are seeing some near-term hesitation and booking behavior given the prominence of COVID in our daily lives. And that, combined with operational challenges that the industry is facing, consumers are delaying travel until case counts subside and the industry operational reliability is restored. So as a result, we are seeing the rate of recovery step down in the months of January and February to approximately 70% versus \u201819 levels from nearly 80% where we were in December. And while the downturn in demand has been quick, we expect an equally rapid improvement once U.S. case counts begin to decline. We remain confident in a strong spring and summer travel season, with significant pent-up demand for consumer and business travel, both domestically and internationally. We expect the month of March to return to the recovery trajectory that we were on in December, resulting in revenue recovery of 72% to 76% for the full quarter. Glen will talk in greater detail about the revenue environment and Dan will walk through our costs shortly. Based on our current outlook, we expect first quarter to be the only loss-making quarter for the year. And we are confident that we will generate a meaningful profit for the full year of 2022 as the recovery resumes and accelerates in the spring and the summer. Despite the challenges of the current environment, the multi-year recovery plan that we laid out last month at Capital Markets Day is unchanged. No one is better positioned than Delta to lead the recovery as business travelers return to the skies. Delta is also uniquely prepared to benefit from the reopening of international markets, which we are optimistic we will start seeing this spring as restrictions lift. Our three core priorities discussed last month remain unchanged : fortifying our trusted consumer brand; restoring financial performance and foundation; and building a better future for our people and our planet. As part of this, we remain firmly committed to our values and ESG goals, including our commitment to fighting climate change and moving forward towards the future of net zero aviation. We recently announced the hiring of our new Chief Sustainability Officer, Pam Fletcher, the industry\u2019s only C-level CSO. Pam established an impressive track record as a senior leader at General Motors and has an extensive history of putting the customer first and developing products that help to enable a world free of emissions. So, as we move past the final phase of the pandemic, I am confident that we will continue our trajectory to not only emerge stronger than before, but to expand our lead in the industry and strengthen our position as the premium airline of choice in the years ahead. Our ambition is to transcend the industry and create significant long-term value for all of our stakeholders. Everything we have done during this long crisis puts us closer to achieving that ambition. Thank you again. And with that, I will turn the call over to Glen. Glen Hauenstein : Thank you, Ed and good morning everyone. Like Ed, I couldn\u2019t be prouder of what the Delta people accomplished during 2021. And I want to congratulate our people on their much deserved special profit sharing payout they will be receiving later next month. During the December quarter, we generated $8.4 billion of revenue. This was above our expectations at the onset of the quarter, driven by strong consumer demand over the holidays. Total RASM was up 6% from the September quarter on a 7% improvement in yield. For the quarter, capacity was 79% restored versus 2019, 5 points below the industry as we maintained a disciplined approach to restoring our capacity. The strengths we have talked about last month at Capital Markets Day are evident in our December quarter results. First, we saw a very strong demand during the holiday period. Domestic results were particularly strong, with holiday PRASM finishing up 8% versus 2019 and with passenger revenue more than 90% recovered. Second, long-haul international trends were positive in October and November as borders reopened and restrictions lifted. This momentum stalled in the second half of December as the Omicron variant resulted in more stringent restrictions and impacted our bookings. Third, we saw continued progression of business travel, with domestic volumes approaching 60% restored during the December quarter. Fourth, our premium products continued to perform well. Domestic premium revenue was 84% recovered versus December quarter \u201819, 9 points better than Main Cabin. Fifth, our diverse revenue streams remain resilient. Amex remuneration during the quarter was more than 110% restored and cargo revenue was more than 160% of 2019 levels. We also continued to see very strong consumer engagement with another record quarter for Fly Delta app downloads and sign-ups for our loyalty program. In the December quarter, we added 1.5 million new SkyMiles members, up 5% from 2019 levels. For all of \u201821, we added 5.5 million new SkyMiles members. This growing engagement demonstrates strong brand preference and our customers\u2019 desire to travel on Delta in 2022. As Ed discussed, the recent rise in COVID cases is having an impact on near-term demand and bookings. Omicron has been different than previous waves. While infections are thankfully less severe in most cases, its high transmissibility is resulting in a swift increase in case counts and impacting short-term demand. With U.S. case counts expected to peak within the next few days, we expect booking levels to rebound quickly. Once case counts begin to decline, we expect revenues to rebound within 30 to 45 days. Additionally, we expect some of the January and February demand decline to be recaptured in future as customers make up for canceled trips. Consistent with our approach all along, we are remaining nimble and agile in how we fly our network. For the March quarter, we expect our capacity between \u2013 to be between 83% and 85% restored a few points below our initial expectation. This includes a more conservative approach to long-haul international flying that we expect to be and we expect to be 15 to 20 points lower than the industry. We have also actioned our regional capacity to ensure labor constraints at regional providers do not impact our operational integrity. We expect these constraints will ease in the second half of the year. For 2022, we still expect our full year capacity to be approximately 90% recovered versus 2019, with the progression weighted to the back half of the year, but this will ultimately be determined by demand. As we outlined at Capital Markets Day last month, Delta is well-positioned for the next phase of the recovery. The Delta people have proven time and time again why Delta is the global airline of choice. We remain focused on improving our competitive position and extending our commercial advantages by investing in premium products, growing our loyalty ecosystem and increasing our revenue diversification. We are confident that the demand recovery will accelerate as the variant subsides, keeping us on a path to exceed 2019 financial performance by 2024. And with that, I will turn the call over to Dan. Dan Janki : Great. Glen, thank you. The Delta team executed well in 2021 in an environment that remains very dynamic, I want to thank our people for their hard work, congratulate them on a well-earned special profit sharing payment. So, let me start with the highlights from the December quarter. We delivered a profitable fourth quarter, reporting earnings of $0.22 per share, representing a pre-tax income of $170 million and a 2% margin on total revenue of $8.4 billion. While it was a strong close to the year, operational disruptions during the last 2 weeks of the quarter impacted our pre-tax results by $80 million. Total fourth quarter operating expenses were $8.1 billion, a 3% increase from the third quarter, driven by both fuel and non-fuel costs from the continued restoration of the airline. Fuel expense of $1.6 billion increased 4% sequentially as fuel prices per gallon increased to $2.10. Total fuel expense included a $0.24 per gallon benefit from the refinery. Embedded in fuel cost is a continued benefit from our fleet renewal, which supported a 4.3% improvement in fuel efficiency compared to 2019. Non-fuel CASM was up 8.3% compared to 2019. This included a 1.2% impact primarily due to lower capacity from cancellations during the last 2 weeks of the quarter. Now, turning to cash flows and the balance sheet, we generated operating cash flow of $518 million. We invested $948 million into the business and we repaid $1.1 billion of debt in the December quarter. We ended the year with $14.2 billion of liquidity and adjusted net debt of $20.6 billion. Now, on to the current environment and the March quarter outlook, as Ed and Glen noted, the variant is magnifying normal seasonality in the March quarter, which is our seasonally weakest of the year. The operational challenges has reduced our capacity outlook and we now expect first quarter ASMs to be between 83% and 85% recovered to 2019. This reduction is a few points from our previously expected capacity recovery. In this environment, we are also paying higher crew premiums over time and COVID-related costs as we work through staffing challenges, mitigation of cancellations and protect our people. We estimate that this will impact first quarter by $60 million to $70 million. The disruptions are impacting our first quarter non-fuel CASM comparison to 2019 by 3 points, with the majority of that driven by fewer ASMs. Absent the Omicron disruption, our March quarter non-fuel CASM is 12% higher than 2019 as our network remains 15% smaller. The sequential step up in non-fuel CASM from December to March quarter is due to maintenance normalizing to 2019 levels. As we talked about last month, when comparing non-fuel CASM to 2019, there was a 7 point benefit related to maintenance in 2021 total year due to depressed flying. This inflects to a 1 point headwind in 2022 as flying is restored. Our quarterly progression basis, the maintenance tailwind was about 5 points specifically in the fourth quarter of 2021 and there will be no benefit in the first quarter of 2022. Additionally, with the ASM sequentially \u2013 essentially flat sequentially, we are not yet benefiting from the scale and efficiency. As the ASM restoration progresses and we exit 2022 close to fully restored, we will realize the scale and efficiency benefit and our comparisons to 2019 will improve. This is consistent with the framework and guidance we laid out last month at Capital Markets Day. Underlying our 7 to 10 full year cost guidance, we expect non-fuel CASM versus \u201819 for the first half of the year to be up in the low to mid-teens, while in the second half of the year, averaging mid single-digits as that scale and efficiency are restored and transition costs subside. While we did not previously expect Omicron-related operational disruptions, there is still a lot of the year to unfold as it equates to both the capacity and demand. And we remain confident in our non-fuel CASM framework and the guidance we laid out last month. For the March quarter, adjusted fuel price per gallon is expected to be between $2.35 to $2.50. Fuel efficiency is estimated to be approximately 6% better than the same period in 2019. When combined with our revenue outlook Glen provided, we expect a loss in January and February months and a return to profitability in the month of March. Now, looking beyond the March quarter, even with the challenging start of the year, we remain positioned to generate a healthy profit in June, September and December quarters, resulting in a meaningful profit for 2022. At this point in the year, we are not providing additional full year guidance beyond the metrics given last month at Capital Markets Day. This includes capacity at 90% resort to 2019, non-fuel CASM up 7% to 10% and gross CapEx of $6 billion. The $6 billion compares to $2.9 billion in 2021 and includes $4.7 billion of aircraft CapEx, including delivery of approximately 70 aircraft and $350 million of modification costs. The remainder is related to ground and technology projects. The March quarter will be our largest delivery quarter with 22 deliveries, resulting in March CapEx of $1.6 billion. Now, reducing debt remains a top financial priority. During 2021, we reduced gross debt by $6 billion, fully funded our pension on a Pension Protection Act basis, with a $1.5 billion contribution and a 16% return on our planned assets. In 2022, we have $1.8 billion in debt maturities, with $1.2 billion in the current quarter. With a heavier CapEx quarter, we expected adjusted net debt to increase to $22 billion in the first quarter. As we achieve sustained cash generation over the next 12 to 18 months, we will continue to opportunistically manage our balance sheet, reducing debt to return to investment grade metrics and making progress towards that $15 billion adjusted net debt target by the end of 2024. So, in closing, at our recent Capital Markets Day, we outlined our financial priorities and our recovery path over the next 3 years. The power of the brand, the strength of the competitive advantage give us strong conviction in the trajectory and the path to full financial recovery. So with that, let me turn it back to Julie for Q&A. Julie Stewart : Thanks, Dan. Cody, can you please remind the analysts how to queue up for a question and go to our first question? Operator : Absolutely. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Savi Syth : Hey, good morning, everyone. And maybe it is for Glen just early January is a fairly important time for booking into the rest of the year. I was curious if there is an \u2013 the impact on some of the forward-looking trends, Omicron is just maybe only impacting kind of close-in bookings. And also, just if there is any color on how it\u2019s impacting kind of the different \u2013 the four different entities here? Glen Hauenstein : Sure. I think if we could pick a period of time for an Omicron variant to surge, we would probably pick this time of year, because I think it\u2019s got two components that are unique to this time of the year. One is these five weeks that it\u2019s impacting are five of the lightest weeks in terms of business travel. And two, as you indicated, it has really impacted more the close-in demand than the further out demand. And we believe we have plenty of time to recover those deferral of vacation bookings for summer. If they don\u2019t come in the third or fourth week of January, it\u2019s easy for them to come in sometime in February, March, so really not concerned yet about spring or summer. We feel that we will have a very, very robust demand profile for spring and summer. And while some of the bookings have been slightly delayed, we are still seeing much \u2013 the biggest magnitude of the impact impacting the next few weeks here. On a regional perspective, for all intents and purposes, Asia remains very constrained. We expect that to continue. And our restoration of Asia through the summer is very minimal. Europe, we\u2019ve seen some countries imposing more restrictions. And at the same time, we\u2019ve seen some countries trying to lift restrictions. Of course, you saw in the UK, restrictions were added, and they were removed. We\u2019re anticipating even further loosening of those restrictions over the next few weeks to the UK. Ireland has come out with much less restrictions. So I think everybody is preparing at this point for the Omicron to be in the rearview mirror, and that travel will be much more restored for the summer than it was for any of the last two summers, and that will lead to really what we think should be very, very strong and healthy demands for transatlantic leisure travel this summer. And then Latin America has continued to be more resilient. Those restrictions have come off in a lot of those countries. And clearly, the short-haul Latin markets are performing well and long haul are continuing to improve. So hopefully, that gives you the color you need. Savi Syth : That\u2019s super helpful, Glen. And I think you alluded to this as well that maybe kind of some of the operational issues should ease up heading into the summer. I know you\u2019ve been hiring a lot of kind of employees and especially pilot and flight attendants since kind of the second half of last year. I just wondering if you could help provide some color on just how much like Slack is being built into with these hirings as you go into the summer because your capacity levels are also coming up into the summer as well. Glen Hauenstein : How much Slack? What do you mean by Slack, Savi? Savi Syth : In the sense that, I guess, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s like employee per aircraft or just like \u2013 you are hiring, but you\u2019re also increasing your capacity. So just curious if we come into the summer and if we get another variant or something like that, if we will have a little bit more kind of, I guess, reserve ratios or something like that to handle kind of the next peak period. Glen Hauenstein : So we\u2019re getting better positioned on staffing. We did hire a lot of people in \u201821 because we had a lot of people leave in \u201820. We\u2019re looking at hiring several thousand people in \u201822. A lot of those are more longer term flight attendants. Pilots take a while to get in the pipeline and include the airline over time. But I think I\u2019m very comfortable with our staffing levels. Yes, there is \u2013 you can\u2019t plan in advance for something that comes up overnight like Omicron there, where the world decides to shut down for 60 days. And we\u2019re going to get through this really quick. And we\u2019re going to be glad we have the staffing in place because I think it\u2019s going to be in the bookings. Your earlier question, the bookings look very good post President\u2019s Day looking forward and really haven\u2019t seen a major impact at all relative to \u201819 expectations in that. So we think it\u2019s going to be a quick rebound. Savi Syth : Make sense. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Andrew Didora : Hi, good morning, everyone. And maybe as a follow-up to Savi\u2019s hiring question, I guess we\u2019re beginning to hear a little chatter from the regional airlines that it\u2019s becoming a bit more difficult to attract and hire new pilots. I know these airlines often feed pilots into your airline and others. But can you maybe give a little bit of color on how many pilots you need to hire over, say, the next three years to kind of hit your capacity plans? And if regionals start to have a hard time finding new pilots in 2022, when do you think it would start to impact your and your other mainline carriers ability to hire, if at all? Glen Hauenstein : Thanks, Andrew. We\u2019re hiring at the mainline somewhere between 100 to 200 a month presently and we expect that pace to continue for some period of time, certainly through \u201822 and into \u201823. We don\u2019t want to get too far ahead of ourselves, but that\u2019s the pace that we\u2019re hiring at. And everyone else in the industry is hiring, too. So it\u2019s not just Delta. We are not having any problem at all at Delta hiring and getting great pools of candidates. That\u2019s viewed as the premium airline that employees in general, but particularly pilots want to come work for, which we\u2019re thrilled about. But it is having the impact at the regionals, as you mentioned. We are down flying in the first half of the year on some of the regional carriers given some of the staffing challenges we\u2019re facing, primarily because of pilot hiring. The largest regional is our own that we work with, which is Endeavor. So we\u2019re working closely with them to help to mitigate some of the disruption and the churn that\u2019s going on through the process. But I think this is a normal period of time. It\u2019s \u2013 the next order of the crisis that we\u2019ve all been through is pulling through, and it\u2019s actually going to be good. It\u2019s going to enable us to make sure that we pay good attention to the regional carriers and meet their needs. But at the same time, I\u2019d much rather have the issue down there than at the mainline. Andrew Didora : Understood. And then just one other question for me, I just wanted to \u2013 you mentioned a little bit, you talked a little bit about this at the Capital Markets Day. But back in December, you did announce that you were putting about $1 billion of new equity capital into three of your international partners. Just wanted to get your thoughts, why do you \u2013 why is it so important to Delta to have such a large equity investment as opposed to maybe a smaller one or none at all? Why is there such a focus there? Just curious on why you think other airlines don\u2019t follow a similar strategy. Thanks. Glen Hauenstein : Well, I can\u2019t speak for other airlines. You\u2019d have to ask them that question. But I know for us, it\u2019s the right strategy. Long-term, our opportunity is international. And when you think about growth, when you think about expansion, when you think about the natural opportunities that Delta has for the future, it\u2019s going to sit in the international arena, and working very closely with that. International is hard. International, the competitive set is very difficult. And it\u2019s hard to do it on your own, to go out there and try to advance a U.S. airline in international borders unless you had some really good, strong partners in the international marketplace. We\u2019re fortunate we have great partners in the international marketplace, The Virgin Atlantic, and Air France, KLM, and AeroMexico, LATAM, Korean Air, et cetera. But we also know that those airlines have their own objectives and they have their own desires. And we have found over time that it\u2019s very, very difficult through solely joint ventures or contractual means to try to enhance the customer experience and provide the very best quality of service if you\u2019re just trying to do it as \u2013 through a contract as compared to being in the room, a seat inside the head of the company, if you will, influencing the decision to ensure that we\u2019re putting our customer interest at the center of what \u2013 because it\u2019s on \u2013 the growth is going to be based on customer preference. And just as you\u2019ve seen, everything that we\u2019ve done here domestically to grow customer preference, big opportunities for us to grow customer preference now sit in the international market. So we\u2019re thrilled with the investments we\u2019re making. We\u2019ve made certain that each one of those investments pencil out on paper. If they are good financial investments as well, we expect to generate significant returns. And candidly, given the fact that we\u2019ve already made significant investments in the past, it\u2019s going to actually allow us to recoup some of that past investment easier by staying invested in the companies. Andrew Didora : Great. Thank you for that, Ed. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from David Vernon with Bernstein. David Vernon : Hi, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. Happy New Year. Glen, can you talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing sort of sequentially in terms of yields on the business in the leisure front as you kind of moved through the quarter and into the first quarter? And then specifically, kind of you look out past Presidents\u2019 Day, how booking activities shaping up there? Glen Hauenstein : We usually don\u2019t comment on future yields, but I can say that through the past quarter, while the bottom of the business yield was about minus 25, which was in the September time frame, and then that moved up to being down low single digits. And I think we talked about that at our Investor Day, and we were pleased with where the structure was sitting as we move forward, and I don\u2019t think anything has really changed since then. So I think that\u2019s the outlook I would give you, is that we think the structure is fine now. We need the traffic back. David Vernon : Okay. And then do you have any updates on discussions with business travelers about their plans for budgeting travel for the remainder of the year? Is there anything you can share on that front? Glen Hauenstein : Yes, absolutely. As you know, we check the pulse our corporate clients very often. And we did it right before Investor Day and we did it right before this call. And what we saw was that the percentage of customers who thought in the first quarter that they would travel the same or more went down slightly. But it was still 80% of the corporate travel survey respondents thought they would travel the same or more in the first quarter than they did in fourth quarter. Office reopenings have been pushed out, as you know. But we are expecting, as Ed indicated, when we get to spring and summer, that we will see a robust demand for business travel as people get back into the regular routine and feel safe traveling. So really optimistic about those results and optimistic about where we think this is going to head in the not-too-distant future. Ed Bastian : David, this is Ed. The business travel, I\u2019d say the best way to characterize I read is kind of a wait and see. They are trying to understand what\u2019s going on with Omicron. They are trying to understand when their offices \u2013 if they are not back, when they are going to open. And they are all making those decisions here. And the good news is that, as we\u2019re watching the case counts start to crest and peak here in our country and declining in certain early parts of the country that had the variant hit first, that\u2019s giving them encouragement to realize that they are going to be able to get back and get their people in, open their offices sooner than maybe they were thinking when first news of Omicron came. So we\u2019re in a pretty good place. When you think about the trajectory we saw over the fourth quarter, we saw a really nice growth in business, both small business as well as big corporates. And small businesses, as we pointed out at the Investor Day, is something we haven\u2019t talked as much about historically, but it\u2019s just a big pool as the corporate space is for us. And then when those offices open starting in the spring, we think it\u2019s going to pick up where we left off in December and grow from there. David Vernon : Great. Thanks, Ed. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So just to kind of pick up on that last point. I mean, hopefully, the next few weeks is the last real disruption from the pandemic, especially with kind of availability of boosters and therapeutics and herd immunity and everything else. So if there is like genuinely like light \u2013 like real light at the end of the tunnel, are you having conversations with the regulators on when we can fly without masks on planes and time line, like full service being restored in the aircraft? Do you have a \u2013 has a big guess on kind of the timing of that? Glen Hauenstein : Well, I think it\u2019s premature, Ravi, to speculate on masks on planes. Obviously, that\u2019s going to be driven by the medical experts and not by the airlines. And we will follow their guidance. But in terms of restoring service on planes, yes, we\u2019re doing that pretty aggressively. And over the course of the next 2 to 3 months, you\u2019re going to see our service patterns largely restored from where we were in 2019 and continue to make the improvements. And when I say restored, restored is not the right word, it\u2019s going to be improved from where we were in \u201819. And we\u2019ve taken the opportunity during the pandemic to make substantial changes to the whole catering spec, who\u2019s providing it. Took ownership positions in terms of kitchens and really big change that customers are going to be delighted when they start traveling again back in the springtime, particularly internationally. It\u2019s going to be good. The thing you were mentioning about the rapid move of the variant, I agree with you. I think that there is a real silver lining here, is that since this thing is moving so fast, it\u2019s so infectious, so many people are getting it, it\u2019s going to push the pandemic into us \u2013 into all of a normalized environment here sooner than we would have liked. So while we were together at Capital Markets Day, we talked about the uncertainty that Omicron presents. Good news is that the uncertainty is going to be short-lived. And the path to normalization, I think we\u2019re even more confident in it when we think about our \u201822 numbers and travel patterns. So it\u2019s not all negative. That\u2019s for sure. Ravi Shanker : Understood. And just a follow-up, forgive me if I missed this, but is there an update on what premium cabin would look like relative to main cabin in the fourth quarter? I think in the past, you\u2019ve said it was running 10 percentage points ahead. And how do you expect that to trend through the year, especially as COVID and the national come back? Thanks. Glen Hauenstein : Well, yes. So we\u2019re very excited about the fourth quarter results. I think it was in the comments that it was 9 points ahead of main cabin for the entire fourth quarter, and we see those trends continuing. We \u2013 the headline for us is that premium leisure, we believe, is here to stay. And that\u2019s something that we want to continue to exploit as we think about we service our customers moving forward and how we lay out the plans and what products and services we offer. Ravi Shanker : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Mike Linenberg : Hey, good morning, everyone. Hey, just two quick \u2013 one quick one for Glen. On the refinery, the revenue piece for the March quarter. I know normally you don\u2019t give guidance there, but it is \u2013 it\u2019s been a big number. It was $1 billion this last quarter. Should we assume, just given where crack spreads are, that March quarter refinery sales will maybe be of a similar magnitude? Glen Hauenstein : Yes, I think that\u2019s the right way to think about it. Our jet consumption will be about the same in the refinery output. So keep it consistent, yes. Mike Linenberg : Okay. Very good. And then second question to Ed here. Ed, I think if you look across the industry right now, I think most airlines, their pilot contracts have now been opened. They are at an amendable point. Yours included. I think one of your competitors is trying to do a quick sort of 2-year type extension. Can you just give us an update of where you are? And I guess, within the context, I mean, you didn\u2019t furlough anybody during the pandemic, so you\u2019re sort of maybe approaching this from a different perspective. Thank you. Ed Bastian : Thanks, Mike. We did not furlough any employee during the pandemic. Pilots included. Yes, we\u2019re in a similar position, I guess, and some of our large competitors are as well, particularly relative to the pilot contract. During the pandemic, it was very difficult for any of the airlines to \u2013 or the union for that matter to feel confident in projecting the future. So I think all talks across the industry have probably put on hold. But we\u2019re now getting ready to reengage, and we will see where that goes. But no, we\u2019re not trying to do an expedited anything. We\u2019re trying to get a real contract with our people. Mike Linenberg : Very good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Jamie Baker : Hey, good morning. First question for Glen, could you expand on your answer to Savi\u2019s question that you anticipate transborder testing impediments to ease during the quarter? For example, as a move from a 1-day back to a 3-day testing requirement for U.S. reentering, is that specifically in your forecast? Is the guidance assume that we get back to November eight levels of sort of testing impediments? I\u2019m only asking because as these headlines do improve, we\u2019re going to be asked whether that\u2019s incremental to the guide or not? Glen Hauenstein : Well, I think what we\u2019ve seen and \u2013 a little more color on that is we\u2019ve seen that initially, everybody reacted by putting in some pretty onerous testing requirements. Since countries that are further along with us like the UK, who\u2019s now on the backside of the Omicron, has now started relaxing those restrictions, and we\u2019ve seen other countries like Ireland relax. We\u2019ve seen Israel relax on the margin. So I think that\u2019s what we would expect. I don\u2019t think for a customer who\u2019s traveling that the 1-day testing requirement that the U.S. has imposed is that all. It\u2019s pretty easy to take a proctored test with you when you travel overseas. So I couldn\u2019t speak to whether the U.S. government was going to go back to the previous policy. But in general, I think once governments feel comfortable that they have a handle on the variant, that they have backed off and started easing the restrictions again, I think that would be something that the whole world is looking towards as we move forward here. Jamie Baker : Okay. And then for Dan, the flat air traffic liability from third quarter to fourth quarter, that\u2019s pretty unusual. Ordinarily, there is about a $700 million sequential decline even in 2020. We saw a few hundred million of decline. What should we read into that other than strong bookings? I mean has there been any change in how you are accounting for travel credits? And on a side note, having recently bought a Delta ticket and having forgotten to apply some existing credits, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m the only passenger to experience this. I\u2019m just trying to think through any implications of credit travel breakage and how that might influence the ATL going forward? Any color there? Dan Janki : Well, one, no change, right? But I think we talked about this a little bit in the third quarter call that the \u2013 remind you that maybe historical seasonalities won\u2019t apply as you\u2019re restoring travel and the airline. And that proved to be the case in fourth quarter and what we saw. I think you\u2019re going to see a similar dynamic in first quarter. Normally, that air traffic liability will grow. You\u2019ve got to account for the additional restoration that you see as you progress towards second quarter that would \u2013 that changes of seasonal impacts. So just take that into consideration. I think fourth quarter is a good proof point that you just can\u2019t take historical practices, but it\u2019s not due to the underlying change in practice. It\u2019s really just the dynamic that\u2019s going on with the restoration of the airline and the growth. Jamie Baker : Okay, okay, it\u2019s perfect. Ed Bastian : And to your question on \u2013 Jamie, this is Ed on \u2013 the question on credit. I don\u2019t know if we announced it this week or not. Dan Janki : Yes, we did. Ed Bastian : We did. Good news. So we extended the expiration date through the end of \u201823. So you\u2019ll be fine. Dan Janki : You can use it, Jamie. Jamie Baker : Okay. I wasn\u2019t particularly worried about it. Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thanks. Maybe just to continue on Jamie\u2019s line of questioning there, can you tell us what breakage as a percent of revenue was in the fourth quarter and kind of how those trends have changed over time? Dan Janki : Yes. The trends haven\u2019t changed and they are consistent, but we don\u2019t actually give breakage to report that. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay. And then just a broader question, as you look back at the business travel recovery you started to see in 4Q, do you think that return to office is as meaningful of a guidepost relative to your initial thinking? Have you seen any decoupling between return to office and business travel recovery? And it\u2019s not a \u2013 that\u2019s not a January 13 question. That\u2019s a \u2013 the recovery you were seeing in the fourth quarter. Ed Bastian : Yes. I think there is a correlation. A lot of business travel is triggered by going to visit companies. And the companies are closed, it makes it a little more difficult to do that. It\u2019s not a one for one. But the fact that particularly the big corporates, the fact that our overall level of corporate demand, the volume return is actually fairly closely correlated, and maybe it\u2019s coincidence or not, I don\u2019t know, but the numbers are pretty tightly correlated to the amount of reopenings we\u2019ve seen indicates there is a real cause and effect there, Duane. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay. I just wondered if we found travel has a higher utility than going back to an office, but I appreciate the thoughts. Glen Hauenstein : Yes. No. We do have \u2013 office is not the only thing. We have a lot of people traveling that aren\u2019t back into office yet. So we have a lot of noise probably in the numbers, and there is a lot of choppiness. As you \u2013 as we navigated the course, it felt like two or three pandemics over the course of 2021 with the various variants. But we are continuing to make good progress. The good news is that all of our corporates are saying they just can\u2019t wait to get back to be with people and be with their own people, be with their customers, visit new opportunities and invest for the future. And I think this is going to be a strong spring and summer. They are just waiting for the all clear sign that you don\u2019t have to worry about a variant as you are traveling. Duane Pfennigwerth : It makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Good morning guys. Thank you for your time. So, you talked about Q1 international capacity being 15 points to 20 points lower than the industry. Maybe can you talk about what metrics you would like to see for that path to ramp capacity back up, how your fleet plays into it and how you think about international capacity as we progress through the year? Glen Hauenstein : Sure. I think we get a \u2013 gave a pretty good outline of how we expect international restoration to occur. And what I would say is we haven\u2019t changed from where we think we will be in the summer yet. What we have changed is the low season, this \u2013 the winter IATA, the remainder of the winter IATA. We had some seasonal services starting up earlier than we would have otherwise done because we thought demand might be back early. And now we are taking that bed off and moving those start dates to later in the year. And I think we still remain very, very confident that once \u2013 as Ed said, once people feel that it\u2019s safe to travel, that they will. And as we said in today\u2019s comments and in all previous is we will remain agile. And if we don\u2019t see that developing, we will pull it down. And if we see it coming faster, we have the ability to accelerate to a certain extent, some growth in international. So really, it\u2019s a \u2013 we are still very optimistic about the summer. And we expect to be 85% to 90% restored in the transatlantic, probably less than 50% in the Pacific and largely restored in Latin America. And that\u2019s what we outlined previously. We really haven\u2019t deviated from that yet. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Okay. And maybe just a follow-on for that. In the domestic market, you are seeing additional capacity come on with a recent order from a low-cost carrier. How do you think about the risks of supply coming into the U.S. market? Glen Hauenstein : We have competed with ULCCs for many, many years. And I think that\u2019s really where we came to a couple of different strategies, including our premium strategy. And I would like to say that some of our highest return markets historically have been straight up against LCCs and ULCCs. So, I think we are really not afraid to compete in those markets. And we think our products stand on their own. And it is a very different product and a very different customer than they are going after. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will hear next from Conor Cunningham with MKM Partners. Conor Cunningham : Hi everyone. Thanks for the time. One point from your Capital Markets Day that I found interesting was just the domestic share gains on the corporate side during the pandemic. In the past, those gains have been somewhat minimal year-over-year, but you clearly used the pandemic advantage. I was just curious, is there a gating factor to you growing share from here? And if there isn\u2019t, what\u2019s your expectations over the next couple of years for your share there? Thanks. Ed Bastian : Conor, this is Ed. Yes, you are right. We did have a meaningful and an outsized share gain. And that\u2019s amongst the big corporates as our corporates really focused on premium. They appreciated the work we did around blocking the middle seats for the entire length of the pandemic while it was quite active. And what we find is when companies come to Delta or customers come to Delta, they tend not to leave, which is a good thing. And so the share tends to be sticky, and we work really hard to ensure that we maintain that. We have had good share gains in the past. Don\u2019t get me wrong. We have it. We kind of had plateaued at a level pre-pandemic. And we are significantly higher in share than our natural seat share is in those markets. So, I think we are going to work hard to make sure we maintain. And if we can grow it, we will. But I wouldn\u2019t expect you to see additional growth, not at that level for the next couple of years. Conor Cunningham : Okay. Great. That was a big move. And then just maybe to take the other side of Ravi\u2019s question. I assume that there is actually going to be another wave of cases at some point. Each wave has been different. But could you just speak to lessons learned during this current wave? The reason why I ask is it just seems like your ability to work directly with your workforce actually benefited your operation relative to some of your competitors as you turned around pretty quickly. Thanks again for the time. Ed Bastian : Yes. Thanks, Conor. I am proud of our team, and it was hellacious three weeks that \u2013 so yes, there are definitely some learnings in there. But the good news is we recovered quickly. We got the operational integrity of the airline back to where it needs to be. It was not easy to do. But the fact that we have a very, very direct and strong and flexible workforce that will do whatever they need to do to ensure customers are being well taken care of and served was important, and that\u2019s shown through. One of the things that to me was really interesting about the last few weeks of this Omicron surge is that demand was really strong. I mean of course, it was built prior to that as it was going into the holidays, but we didn\u2019t see cancellations. Cancellations were taking is because we couldn\u2019t staff the planes. But \u2013 so the resilience of customers and their willingness and interest in getting into travel once things clear, I think is going to be that much stronger. And each \u2013 as each successive wave occurs, I think people are getting more used to, the fact that we are having \u2013 this is the virus we are going to have to manage and live with over time, and it\u2019s going to be a seasonal virus. It\u2019s not going to be a pandemic. And that\u2019s what the doctors all believe and that\u2019s what I think we are going to wind up seeing here. And we have got all the tools and the technologies, and the capability and the confidence that we can manage just that. Conor Cunningham : Okay. Thanks, Ed. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Myles Walton with UBS. Myles Walton : Thanks. Good morning. I was just wondering, maybe Ed, how do you think the zero COVID case policy in China plays out through the course of the year with respect to your business? I know it\u2019s a smaller piece. But just curious what you think can make them move to endemic because clearly zero COVID case policy would still be in the pandemic mode? Ed Bastian : That\u2019s a question, Myles, is way above my pay grade, national policy in China. It\u2019s been interesting as we have watched a lot of the nations around the world all manage it seemingly somewhat differently. As it relates to us, you are right. China is not a big part of our network. We would like it to be a bigger part, but it historically hasn\u2019t been. It\u2019s going to be a pretty small part of our network at least for the next couple of years and we will see beyond that. One of the things we do is we look at where we put our metal is demand. And there is not strong demand going up between the U.S. and China now. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a situation that\u2019s alarming to us. But hopefully, Asia and it\u2019s not just Japan, but it\u2019s \u2013 or China, but Japan and other office, Hong Kong and Singapore, they are all going to need to figure out how to move to that seasonal virus that I just talked about. And they got the tools and the technologies to manage it. I think it\u2019s just going to be a longer road. We have a very downward feel as to growth rates in Asia for some time here. And fortunately, we have got a great partner in Korea that can do that flying in the meantime for us. Myles Walton : Okay. And just follow-up, Dan, on the other expense, non-operating other expense for 2022. Anything to throw out there space, whether it\u2019s interest or pension moving parts? Dan Janki : No. I think you \u2013 when you look at the total year for 2021, it was just around $900 million when you take the interest expense with the pension. It\u2019s going to be about that level, slightly above actually. You are going to have a little less pension income. And then that interest expense line will start to really move down in \u201823 and \u201824 as you see that adjusted net debt coming down to our $15 billion target. Myles Walton : Okay. Thank you. Julie Stewart : Cody, we have time for one more analyst question before then moving to media Q&A. Operator : Thank you. I will take our final question on the analyst side from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay : Hey. Good morning. Thank you. A couple for me. Glen, I think it for Glen. I know you had a need, obviously, with Sandeep leaving. But how can Scott Laurence help your team? And what is it about him that you like the most when you interviewed him? Glen Hauenstein : Listen, we don\u2019t comment on individual performance or individual reasons. But I think Scott is a very well seasoned industry executive. And I think he is going to bring us some additional value over time. We will see when he gets here, starting next week, I believe. Hunter Keay : Okay. And then do your capacity planners talk to Dr. Tang when you plan the schedule? Ed Bastian : Every day. Every schedule is now Tang approved. Hunter Keay : Got it. Thank you very much. Ed Bastian : Thank you, Hunter. Julie Stewart : That will wrap the analyst portion of the call. I will now turn it over to Tim Mapes, our Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, to start the media questions. Tim Mapes : Julie, we have about 12 minutes for conversations with members of the media. If you would, please remind everyone the process to get in the queue for that. And I would remind everybody that we are going to try to keep this moving and do one question with one follow-up and end about 10 minutes after the hour, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] I will take our first question from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Mary Schlangenstein : Hi. Good morning. I wanted to see if you could comment of the passengers who had canceled flights during December, how many of those \u2013 what percentage of those were able to actually complete that travel, rebook or whatever, and complete that travel during the holidays? Can you talk about that percentage? Ed Bastian : Hi Mary, this is Ed. I don\u2019t have the numbers in front of me. But the vast majority of the customers that had to be rebooked, we had space that we were able to accommodate on other flights to get them to their destinations. So, it\u2019s not something that we enjoy doing, but we were able to get people to where they need to be for the holidays. Mary Schlangenstein : Okay. So, no notable or noteworthy amount of lost revenue through that? Ed Bastian : Well, there was flying, and some customers decided not to travel. So, that\u2019s \u2013 at least we estimated there was a $70 million hit for that. But no, there is not a substantial. If customers wanted to travel on Delta, we may certainly, we got them there. Mary Schlangenstein : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Alison Sider with Wall Street Journal. Alison Sider : Hi. Thanks so much. You talked about sort of pandemic entering this new phase where it\u2019s becoming more seasonal, and it doesn\u2019t necessarily impact people\u2019s willingness to travel all that much. How does that change kind of the way you plan and staff for peak periods? If there is going to be a future brief, but dramatic flare up like we just saw, would you have a smaller peak holiday schedule, or how does that change kind of your planning process? Ed Bastian : Well, our goal, Ali, is to ensure that we are meeting customer demand. And so I don\u2019t know that we can change customers\u2019 demand and interest in traveling during peak periods or holidays. And that\u2019s when they go, and we need to make sure we are there to serve them. There are learnings from Omicron, as I mentioned on the analyst call. But probably the most important learning that I saw was that, even with Omicron being the headline throughout the country and the disruption that the airline industry was experiencing from people getting sick from Omicron, travelers are still traveling. And they were determined to travel. They were resilient. We didn\u2019t see mass cancellations. We didn\u2019t see people deciding it wasn\u2019t \u2013 didn\u2019t feel right. And so I think that this was another phase that we have passed through. And who knows, is there going to be another pandemic type virus awaiting us, there is no \u2013 we don\u2019t know what it is, but we are also humbled by the fact we don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know yet in this environment. But we do really believe that we are going to enter a nice period of being able to manage and create a set of normalcy around travel behaviors, particularly, but hopefully, life in general. And this virus will become very similar to what we have with the flu right now and move into a seasonal category with tools and technologies to manage. Flu is a pretty significant cause of death historically. In our country, I think we are seeing a lot less of that over the last couple of years because of the new tools and mitigations that we have learned to live with. And I think you are going to see people may be wearing masks and then doing different things and having technologies and antivirals that they can take to help manage to \u2013 in order to keep themselves moving. We are getting to a point where I think, Ali, we are going to focus our efforts on the small percent of people that are immunocompromised that are at most at risk. But the general population is learning and willing and exhibiting an interest to live with this risk. Alison Sider : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We will hear next from Leslie Josephs with CNBC. Leslie Josephs : Hi, good morning everyone. Just a question on hiring, can you just update us on the number of people that you want to hire? And is there any detail on perks or increased salaries that you are offering to attract workers? And if there is anywhere that you are having problems attracting workers, either work group or geography, I would love to hear that. Thanks. Ed Bastian : Yes. Leslie, as you know, we hired a substantial number of people in the past year. I think it was around 9,000. We are going to be hiring less people this year. But this number is still in the, say, 3,000 to 5,000 range depending on how demand shapes and comes back. We are not having any meaningful impact in terms of difficulty getting people to come work for this company. Regionally, yes, there are some pressure points in some of the higher cost markets, particularly in the Northeast. But no, we are doing a very, very good job of bringing the team together. And we are not having to put any unusual perks out there in order to attract talent. Leslie Josephs : Thanks. Ed Bastian : The ability to travel free is a great perk and we have always had that at Delta. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Edward Russell with Skift. Edward Russell : Hi. Thank you. Following on what Leslie asked, in terms of the regional flying reductions that you are doing in the first half, what is Delta doing to mitigate that? Glen Hauenstein : Well, we have taken about 20% to 25% of our regional flying down in the first part of the year. And that is \u2013 it stems really from flow-through pilots to the mainline as well as getting the right people and the right training seat at the regional carriers. And I think those are the two things that we are counting on as we get to the back half of the year to resolve themselves. So, I think one of the things is how many hours you have in seat, can you get trained, and can you get moved, we are working through all the details of how those transactions or transitions actually happen. And we are really pretty confident now that by the second half of this year, that the pipelines will be more full and we will be able to restore a lot of the small and medium-sized communities that we have had to pull down during the shortage in the first half of the year. So, we are meeting on this really daily and weekly to make sure that this actually can materialize. But right now, we feel very confident that we can catch back up again as we get to the back half of the year. Edward Russell : Okay. Thank you. And one follow-on. Have you had to park any regional aircraft as a result or exit any markets? Glen Hauenstein : We have had to exit a handful of markets. Mostly those are on per seat. So, they weren\u2019t directly scheduled by Delta. So, as of now, things that Delta had scheduled control over, we have not closed any stations, although our partners have. And what was the second part of that question? Edward Russell : Have you had to park any regional aircraft as a result? Glen Hauenstein : There are parked regional airplanes right now. But we expect those to return back into the sky, as I said earlier, in the second half of the year. Edward Russell : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from David Slotnick with TPG. David Slotnick : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to talk a little bit more about premium leisure, which you mentioned at the Capital Markets Day and again today. What does that look like in the long-haul market particularly? Is that people who are able to pay for Delta One? Is that more affordable Delta One take? Is that a more widespread premium economy or something else? Glen Hauenstein : Well, we have got big plans for our long-haul premium leisure sector. This year, we will be ubiquitous in introducing a new product, Delta Premium Select, to the transatlantic marketplace. And that is really designed specifically for higher-end leisure as well as corporate travelers whose travel policies don\u2019t include the flatbed Delta One product. So, early returns on that are phenomenal, far above our expectations. And as we get to ubiquity, we will monitor that closely, and we will report back to you. But we are excited about that. We are excited about the enhancements that Ed talked about as we get to spring and summer on the existing premium products in the long haul. And we think we have over the years developed a great suite of products that fit a lot of needs for customers, whether or not it\u2019s just basic transportation and getting there safely and on time, to really more of the luxury products, with the flatbed seats and the luxurious amenities that come with that. So, a wide spectrum. And if you think of where we started, we started with just a flatbed and a coach product. So, now we have a full suite of five products that we can offer in the transatlantic marketplace. And that will extend to all of our internationals by \u201823. Tim Mapes : Cody, we have time for one final question, please, before we have Ed wrap it up. Operator : Thank you. We will take our final question from Robert Silk with Travel Weekly. Robert Silk : Good morning guys. So, I think you said you expect the pilot shortage, or I guess the flow-through to sort of resolve itself as the year progresses. Explain to me how you expect that to happen to get more people just to get more pilots coming back into the system. Glen Hauenstein : Really, there are no shortage of pilots wanting to come to us or really to our regional partners. It\u2019s a matter of them getting through the training and getting into the right seat with the right number of hours. So, that\u2019s what we are working through as we look to resolve the current staffing issues there, is how long does that take to really catch up and when we will be in a position to start growing those regional players again. Robert Silk : Okay. So, I guess that answers my question. Thank you. Ed Bastian : Well, thank you, everyone. I want to wrap up here and appreciate your time this morning. Thank you for joining us. I particularly want to thank once again the Delta employees for the amazing work they have done over this course of this last year. Congratulate them on this special profit sharing payment, which we are thrilled to be able to award them with, and realize that we are making really good progress. Omicron has been a challenging period of time, but we have learned from it. There is new findings. And one of the most important findings is that we are going to move through this thing fastly \u2013 quickly and get to a point of stabilization in our views. So with that, being that we are in the State of Georgia, we have to over the \u2013 close of the go dogs, and congratulate them our employees, national champions. And thank you all for joining us today. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We do thank you all for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following today\u2019s presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the call over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Julie Stewart : Thank you, April, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our March quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining us from Atlanta today are our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; our CFO, Dan Janki. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta's performance and strategy. Glen will provide an update on the revenue environment. And Dan will discuss cost fleet and our balance sheet. After the prepared remarks, we will take analyst questions and we ask \u2013 please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up so we can get to as many of you as possible. And after the analyst Q&A, we will move to our media questions. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factor's that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ed. Ed Bastian : Well, thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. We are proud to have raised the Ukrainian flag at our global headquarters in Atlanta in solidarity with the people of Ukraine. At Delta, we've provided meaningful financial and operational support to assist the people of the region in connection with our partnership through the International Red Cross. This morning, we reported March quarter results, marking another important step forward in our recovery. We generated $200 million of free cash flow in the quarter and a 10% operating margin in the month of March. Our revenue recovery in the March quarter reached 79% of 2019 levels, five points ahead of the midpoint of our initial guidance. As expected, January and February generated operating losses. As Omicron receded, we saw a surge in demand, supporting an inflection to a solid profit in the month of March. Delta continues to provide best-in-class operational, customer and financial results in a dynamic environment. This results from the dedication, professionalism and hard work of Delta's more than 75,000 people worldwide. Restoring capacity during a period of rapid demand recovery has proven challenging for all of us in the industry but Delta people continued to lead the way, I want to thank our customers for their patience and understanding as we navigate the challenges of ramping up operations into the peak travel period. And I know, our teams have been working incredibly hard, and I want to thank all of them for what they're doing for our customers and for each other. We rewarded our people with a special profit sharing payout in February based on the second half of 2021 profitability and announced a 4% pay increase that's going to be effective May 1. These actions align with Delta's long-standing values of shared success with our people. With the rebound in demand, the month of March was the best cash sales month in Delta's history, outpacing our prior record from spring of 2019 despite offering 10% fewer seats. In March, we had our first month in two years of positive unit revenue compared to 2019, and we achieved record co-brand acquisitions, co-brand spend and cargo revenue. Domestic consumer revenues are exceeding 2019 levels and the recovery in business travel, revenue has accelerated as offices reopen and business travelers rebuild face-to-face relationships. Demand for long-haul international is growing, as travel restrictions lift, led by the Transatlantic. To date, we have not seen an impact to travel demand from the conflict in Ukraine, but we, of course, are monitoring this closely. Nearly all European countries have now removed entry testing requirements for vaccinated customers. We continue to join the rest of the US travel industry, in urging the US government to lift predeparture testing requirements. As we prepare for the peak summer season, we continue to be very focused on operational readiness. With 4,000 new members joining the Delta team already this year, we feel good about our staffing and our ability to meet demand as we continue to restore the airline. Our customers are seeing the benefits of our ongoing investments to improve the travel experience. This spring, we are opening new, modernized terminals in Los Angeles, LaGuardia and Seattle. These generational investments enhance Delta's already leading positions in key hubs and provide an elevated ground experience for our customers. We continue to upgrade our fleet, recently taken delivery of our first Airbus 321neo. The state-of-the-art aircraft is scheduled to begin service May 20 from Boston to San Francisco and features our new domestic first-class seat design, with nearly one-third of the seats in premium cabins and improved fuel efficiency, this will be the best aircraft we fly for our customers and generate the highest returns for our owners. Our strategic decision to accelerate investments in our airports, our fleet and our technology during the pandemic will benefit Delta and our customers for years to come. As COVID shifts from a pandemic to a manageable seasonal virus, there are clear signs of pent-up demand for travel and experiences, as consumers' spending shifts from goods to services and experiences, travel restrictions lift and business travelers continue to return to the skies. Against this improving backdrop, we are building momentum in the June quarter, with expectations for a 12% to 14% operating margin and strong free cash flow despite higher fuel prices. Our revenue recovery is expected to reach 93% to 97% of the 2019 levels, with double-digit unit revenue improvement. We are successfully recapturing a significant portion of the run-up in fuel. This is occurring almost in real time, given the strong demand environment as well as Delta's growing brand preference, our premium product focus and measured approach to capacity. While we are confident in summer demand and the capacity plans that we have in place, given macro uncertainty, we will remain nimble on capacity for the second half of the year and continue to prioritize sustained profitability. I'd like to pause and put that Q2 guidance into perspective. At 12% to 14% operating profit, we are only four points behind our June 2019 quarterly operating margin, and that's despite fuel prices being up 50% from that time period and our capacity only 85% restored. So we are greatly encouraged by the momentum we are seeing, and we remain confident in our outlook for meaningful full year profit for 2022. As we take note of these achievements, I'm pleased with the progress we're making across the three core priorities we laid out at Capital Markets Day last December. First, we continue to fortify our trusted consumer brand, demonstrated by loyalty and record engagement with our customers. The strength of our brand has never been greater and has been recognized by the Wall Street Journal, Fortune, Business Travel News and many, many others. And our customers are taking note that our Net Promoter Scores consistently above 2019 coming out of the pandemic. We intend to build on the momentum we gained over the last two years. Second, we are restoring our financial performance. As revenue improves and we regain a competitive cost structure, we're returning to profitability, generating strong free cash flow and making progress on debt repayment. And our third priority is building a better future for our people and our planet, including our ongoing commitment to creating a sustainable future for aviation. We are continuing to invest in the physical, emotional and financial well-being of our people, while prioritizing diversity, equity and inclusion at all levels of the company. Our mission of connecting the world has never been more important than it is today, and I'm as confident as ever that we'll achieve our ambition for a leading consumer brand to transcend the industry and deliver financial outcomes that create significant and resilient long-term value for all of our stakeholders. It's been an encouraging period of recovery, and it's exciting to see our customers returning to the skies. Thank you again. And with that, I'll turn it over to Glen to update the revenue environment. Glen Hauenstein : Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. With robust demand, growing preference for the Delta brand and quick actions to recapture higher fuel prices, we achieved significant milestones in the month of March and have momentum as we head into the summer. None of this would be possible without our people, and I couldn't be prouder of the Delta team and the results that they are delivering. A huge thank you to all. During the March quarter, we generated $8.2 billion of revenue. This was approximately $500 million higher than our initial guidance in January, resulting in a revenue recovery of 79% compared to 2019. We continue to execute a disciplined approach to keeping capacity in line with demand. For the quarter, capacity was 83% restored versus 2019 and at the low end of our initial guide and below the industry. The quarter was a tale of two halves. While Omicron depressed demand in the January and early February, we saw an unparalleled demand recovery from Presidents Day on. Our revenue recovery versus 2019 progressed from 70% in January to approximately 80% in February to 85% in March, with momentum building into April. March was the first month in two years of positive unit revenue compared to 2019 with PRASM up 1% and TRASM up 3%. Premium products once again led the way with domestic premium revenue approximately 100% restored to March of 2019 levels. We also achieved our highest ever monthly cash sales, as Ed mentioned, our highest direct sales, highest co-brand acquisitions, highest co-brand spend and highest cargo revenue in the month of March. Business travel volumes reached the highest post-pandemic levels we've seen and, importantly, in March, corporate fares inflected to positive versus 2019 for the first time. This drove an acceleration in the recovery of business revenues with improvement in both corporate contracted customers and small and medium-sized enterprises. As we exited the quarter, domestic corporate sales improved to approximately 70% recovered versus 2019, and our recent survey results show that 90% of our corporate accounts anticipate travel volumes to increase in the June quarter as offices continue to reopen. Additionally, we are seeing more corporates implement changes to travel policies. For example, domestic travel restrictions have been completely removed for all of our top corporate accounts. And increasingly, corporates are allowing upsells to premium cabins and refundable products. Strength in cash sales and seasonality drove a $2.8 billion sequential increase in our air traffic liability. The increase in advanced ticket sales outpaced normal seasonal trends, resulting in an ATL balance of $9.1 billion at the end of March, up from $6.6 billion in March of 2019. We expect the ATL will continue to build in the June quarter, albeit at a slower rate than what we saw in the March quarter. For the June quarter, we expect revenue recovery versus 2019, as Ed mentioned, to improve to 93% to 97% on 84% capacity restoration. This reflects a low double-digit TRASM growth versus 2019, with all entities expected to post positive unit revenues compared to 2019, except for the Pacific. We expect April yields to be up double-digits compared to 2019 with further strengthening as we approach June, positioning us to successfully recapture a significant portion of the higher prices -- fuel prices in the June quarter. Geographically, domestic and Latin revenues continue to lead the recovery, and fewer restrictions in major international markets are unlocking demand for long-haul travel. We expect a very strong summer in the Transatlantic based on demand trends. And in the Pacific, we are encouraged by the opening of Australia, South Korea and other countries in Southeast Asia. When countries reopen, we see a rapid restoration of demand. For example, following South Korea's border opening on April 1, we expect load factors to improve from the low 50s in March to the low 90s by June. We expect that heavily restricted regions, such as China and Japan, will continue to put pressure on overall Pacific unit revenues until borders fully reopen. A few months ago at Capital Markets Day, we outlined three commercial strategy pillars, and we've made strong progress across each of these at the start of this year. First, our premium products continue to lead the recovery and the introduction of Delta Premium Select to the Transatlantic marketplace has been a success, with early returns far exceeding our expectations. By this summer, we will have expanded Delta -- EPS to 80% of our Transatlantic flights. Over the next few years, we expect premium seat growth to continue to outpace Main Cabin, and we're confident in the consumer shift towards higher-quality products is here to stay. To-date, premium recovery has been led by consumer, and we see further upside as more and more business travelers return to the skies. Next, growing loyalty is evident across several key metrics. Our Net Promoter Score remains above 2019 even as volumes increase. And during the quarter, we acquired a record number of new SkyMiles members and our co-brand spend continues to far outpace 2019, up 39% in the month of March. Loyalty is an important driver of our third pillar, increasing our revenue diversification. Other revenue was fully recovered to 2019 levels during the March quarter, led by loyalty and cargo. Remuneration from American Express during the quarter of $1.2 billion was 25% higher than 2019, a new quarterly record that keeps us on track for our full year goal of more than $5 billion in remuneration. Cargo had an exceptional quarter, up 51% compared to 2019, with the month of March marking our best ever cargo month in the company's history. MRO revenues were 22% below 2019 as supply chain issues slowed our engine throughput. MRO margins remain healthy, and we are excited to scale this business over the next few years as the installed base of next-generation engines continues to grow. By leveraging the Delta platform, we are further diversifying our revenue mix. In the March quarter, premium products and non-ticket revenue sources generated 58% of total revenue, up three points from the same period in 2019. This improvement gives us a high level of confidence in achieving our goal of more than 60% by 2024 as we laid out in Capital Markets Day. In closing, Delta has emerged in a stronger relative position by staying true to our core competitive strengths and our commitment to our customers and employees. And as the final phase of demand recovery takes hold and preference for our brand continues to grow, I am more confident than ever in Delta's path to exceed 2019 financial performance by 2024. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Dan to talk more about the financials. Dan Janki : Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. Starting with the highlights of the March quarter. Our operating loss was $793 million, was better than our expectation. As anticipated, we saw losses in January and February due to Omicron and seasonal weakness. And we inflected to a solid profit in March, with a 9.4% adjusted operating margin. Fuel expense was $2.1 billion. It increased 32% sequentially from the December quarter. Fuel price per gallon averaged $2.79 for the quarter. This included a $0.07 per gallon benefit from the refinery. Non-fuel costs rose 6% sequentially, with non-fuel CASM up 15% compared to 2019 on 17% less capacity. We generated operating cash flow of $1.8 billion. We reinvested $1.6 billion into the business, resulting in free cash flow of $200 million. Delivering a profit in the month of March and positive cash flow for the quarter were important achievements, especially considering the impact of Omicron and higher fuel prices. We ended the quarter with adjusted net debt of $20.9 billion. This was more than $1 billion better than our initial expectations due to strength in cash receipts that Ed and Glen spoke to. We repaid $1.4 billion of gross debt, ending March with nearly $13 billion of liquidity. Now turning to the outlook. We expect the June quarter non-fuel CASM to be up 17% compared to 2019. The two point increase from the March quarter is driven by higher selling-related costs, an expected 45% sequential increase in revenue and our anticipated step-up in maintenance costs on a similar level of capacity restoration. With the first half non-fuel CASM in the mid-teens, which is two points higher than planned on lower capacity, we expect to be closer to the high end of the full range of up 7% to 10%, implying the second half will improve up to the mid-single digits. This improvement is driven by continued capacity restoration from the low to mid-80s in the first half to the mid-90s by the end of the year. The resulting scale and efficiency will drive the step function change in our non-fuel CASM. Now let me give you a little context on how we get this improvement. The recovery in international travel enables us to shift our wide-bodies from our domestic to our international, where we get better efficiency from gauge and stage and improved staffing. Narrow-body utilization will improve, with a 10-point increase expected by the end of the year, giving us a combined benefit of higher capacity and more efficient allocation of our fleet. Further, as we fill out our schedules and we create greater stability in our operations with more consistency and depth in both the domestic and the international network, this is enabling efficiency gains in our facilities and productivity of our workforce. We remain confident in our multiyear cost framework laid out at Capital Markets Day. Regaining a competitive cost structure is critical to our success. At the same time, we will continue to remain nimble on capacity as we manage for profitability in this higher fuel price environment. On fuel for the June quarter, we expect an adjusted fuel price per gallon of $3.20 to $3.35. This includes a $0.20 benefit from the refinery, and these are based on the forward curves as of last Friday. Our Monroe refinery provides a unique benefit, acting as a partial hedge to elevated cracks. This is especially true with New York Harbor Jet cracks, where our production at Monroe provides 100% offset. Based on our June quarter outlook for revenue and costs, we expect operating margins to be between 12% and 14%. With the expectations for solid profitability and further build in our air traffic liability, we expect to generate another quarter of positive free cash flow after investing $1.2 billion in the business and expect to end the June quarter with adjusted net debt of approximately $20 billion. As we achieve sustained cash generation, we will continue to opportunistically manage our balance sheet, reducing debt to return to investment-grade metrics and making progress towards our $15 billion adjusted net debt target by the end of 2024. For the year, our CapEx outlook of $6 billion is unchanged, with our reinvestment primarily driven by the continued renewal of our fleet. We expect to take delivery of approximately 70 new and gently used aircraft this year, including 26 A321neos. This large grade gauge aircraft fits well with our upgauging strategy and will be our most fuel-efficient aircraft in our fleet with the lowest seat cost. We also continue to accept delivery of new 220s, three, 3900s and three, 5900s. These aircraft are expected to contribute to the full restoration of our capacity and to our goal of using a 7% less fuel per ASM in 2022 when compared to 2019. In addition to the financial benefits, improved efficiency is an important step in our journey to a more sustainable future. During the quarter, we announced actions to scale and advance sustainable fuels. We signed an offtake agreement with Gevo for approximately 75 million gallons of SAF annually over seven years. We anticipate to start in mid-2026 progressing us towards our 2030 10% SAF commitment. We also announced a collaboration with Airbus on the research and development of hydrogen-powered aircraft and the infrastructure it requires. So in closing, we are executing against our priorities laid out at Capital Markets Day, and I'm encouraged by the momentum in our financial recovery. I would sincerely like to thank the Delta people for everything they do every day. Our people will always be our most important competitive advantage. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Julie for Q&A. Julie Stewart : Thanks, Dan. April, can you please remind the analysts how to queue up for a question and then go to our first question. Operator : Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] And we'll first hear from Mike Linenberg of Deutsche Bank. Mike Linenberg : Oh, hey, good morning everyone. Fantastic outlook. I guess, I want to focus on capacity with -- so my question is to Glen. Look, you operated 83% of 2019 in the March quarter and things have obviously gotten a lot better for the June quarter. I mean I just sort of think about the Omicron impact in January and February, it was pretty impactful. And yet we're just moving up one point sequentially, 83% to 84%. So I guess, Glen, is this as much driven by the fact that it's all about maintaining operational reliability and really just running the best schedule that there is and that will drive not just the revenue premium, but overall revenue and less re-accommodation costs? And I guess as a sort of corollary to that question, are you watching what's going on over in Europe and seeing how several European carriers are being forced to cancel because of the spread of this other variant and so you guys want to make sure that you're just well prepared and well reserved? Glen Hauenstein : I think it's all of the above. I think you asked and answered your own question there. You did a great job of articulating our viewpoint is the priority is to operate reliably and the other priorities do not get ahead of demand. So this is a very recent demand increase that we've seen. The uptick just started about six to eight weeks ago, in late February and March. And so as we get through the year, if these demand trends continue, we have the opportunity to take another tick-up or we could pivot in a different direction if warranted. But I think, it has made it very clear to us that being nimble until we get to the very end of this is the key to our success. And I think we've done a very good job as a company being nimble in our offering throughout the pandemic and really been closest to actual demand if you look back at what demand was. Mike Linenberg : Great. We and investors love the discipline. Thanks. Operator : Next, we'll hear from Catherine O'Brien of Goldman Sachs. Catherine O'Brien : Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks so much for the time. So maybe a bit of a follow-up to Mike's question. I've been hearing from some of your peers and other industry folks that labor supply is continuing to weigh down on the ability to ramp up capacity. And as we enter 2Q, labor might actually be a bit tighter than we thought at the beginning of the year, just given Omicron-driven training delays and higher attrition rates. I guess, first, are you seeing the theme at Delta? And if so, did that impact your 2Q capacity plans versus your plans back Investor Day at all? Thanks. Ed Bastian : Hi, Catie, this is Ed, I'll take that. We've been at this for the better part of the last 18 months getting ahead of it. And we hired over 10,000 people last year. We hired another 4,000 people already this year. So we've hired 15,000 people. And we are largely where we need to be on staffing. Yes, pilots have a training pipeline and it will take some time before pilots are fully in category and where we want them positioned. It'll probably take another year or two. Flight attendants, likewise, we're hiring flight attendants and there's a queue as to how much many people we can put through the training pipeline. But that's not where the real congestion is. It's in the airport, it's on the ground experience, it's making sure we have our suppliers ready and positioned. One thing we did last year, really almost two years ago now, is we took over a lot of the functions at the airport that had been outsourced, catering, cleaning, wheelchair pushing. And we have Delta people in position, and we've hired Delta people to do it to make certain that we get the best experience for our customers. And you know what? Not only are people doing a much better job at it, we're also doing it much more efficiently and effectively and customers are appreciating it. So the labor situation, you're right, has changed pretty dramatically over the course of the last two years. We've been out ahead and that's why you look at our operational stats over that time frame, we've led the industry consistently. Catherine O'Brien: That's great. And maybe just a quick one for Glen. The AmEx remuneration is a bright spot again this quarter. But would I be correct to think maybe Omicron created some noise at the start to the Q and maybe we see that accelerate even further as we move through the year? I know you just reiterated your goal that you said at Investor Day for $5 billion plus contribution this year. But if we do see an acceleration from 1Q, might still be some upside to that. And thanks again for all the time. Congrats. Glen Hauenstein : Yes, I think we're always hopeful for upside. I think what we're excited about when we dissect the spend is that you can really see the spend moving from goods to services and particularly increases in the airline spend on the card. So those are very encouraging statistics for us to continue to monitor as we move through the year. But I think you\u2019ve really seeing that as the moving away from goods and the movement towards experiences and services. Julie Stewart : Anything further Catherine? Catherine O'Brien: No. That was it from me. Thank you so much for the time. Operator : Next, we'll hear from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Brandon Oglenski : Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking questions. Glen, you provided an update. I think you said domestic corporate travel 70% recovered and international 50% in March. Can you just give us some insight on how those bookings are shaping up here early in 2Q? And then second to this question, how much do you think the international testing requirement is holding back trips across the Atlantic right now? Glen Hauenstein : First, I'll answer the second first. I think that is the next leg up that we see in the demand set, and we think we have very quite robust demand. But there certainly is, in the minds of some consumers, some hesitancy to go abroad and risk being caught, not being able to get back because of catching COVID. So hopefully, we can see that roll back in the next few weeks here. I think the \u2013 we are hearing good signs from Washington. We'll see, hopefully, that comes out here. And that would be one of the final things that we would need in place for us to really say that COVID is in our rearview mirror. So hopefully, that happens. And then your second question was what, I'm sorry. Brandon Oglenski : I think \u2013 when you were talking about, I think, domestic corporate travel at about 70%, international at about 50% in March, can you give us any insights into how that's improving in 2Q? Glen Hauenstein : Absolutely. And I think the one that we're really excited about right now is Transatlantic business which for the first time last week crossed domestic restoration in terms of volume. And so that was a big improvement from where we had been just six or eight weeks ago. So it does look like Transatlantic business is returning robustly, and that's very exciting for us. And I think what we're also excited about is this survey that we just got back that said 90% expect to travel more in 2Q than they did at 1Q. So I think when we report to you next quarter, we'll see both of those numbers continuing to move up. And of course, the big question mark is when will Japan and China reopen? And that's probably not in this next quarter and hopefully some time this fall, but that's a little bit further out. What I would say is when these countries are open, business returns quickly. So to Korea, to Australia, we've seen very rapid increases in business demand as those countries have opened. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Operator : Next, we'll hear from Helane Becker of Cowen. Helane Becker : Thanks very much, operator. Thank you for the time everybody. So just a couple of questions on the cost side of the equation, I know, there's not a lot you can do about fuel. But on the labor cost side, to attract people, I mean, I think, Ed, you said you're not going to have to hire that many more people this year. But to retain people, are you finding that you have to raise salaries more than the 4% that you've already slated for May first? Ed Bastian : Hi, Helane, no, we're not. One of the great things about our brand is throughout this period we've been able to attract and bring in the 15,000 people I talked about with fundamentally not having to change the scales we've used in select high-priced markets, some sign-on bonuses, very judiciously. But fundamentally, no, our scales are intact and the 4% increase May 1st helps. Helane Becker : That's very helpful. Thank you. And then my other question is like kind of unrelated, but I think \u2013 I feel like, it was Glen who mentioned that you saw a record cargo number in March, I want to say. So I'm thinking about what you're carrying and what you're seeing in air freight rates and why you think it was so strong and whether that can continue into the second quarter, and if it's meaningful. Like 18 questions in there, Glen. Glen Hauenstein : Right. Well, clearly, we know about supply chains trying to catch up. And clearly, airfreight has been one of the ways to relieve that pressure. And so we've seen airfreight rates continue to move in a favorable direction. I'd say the one caution I have right now is the closure of China. And China has been, of course, a very strong, strong market for us in the cargo area. And with Shanghai closed and we're literally not flying to China right now until Shanghai reopens, so that's going to weigh a little bit on cargo revenues as we move forward. But as that does reopen, then you can see that pent-up demand for goods that need to get shipped out of China and potentially even another leg up. So I'd say, we're in a temporary pause right now because of the issues in China, but I expect, as China comes back online, and I don't know the exact date, I don't think anybody does, but we could see an even stronger demand coming out of that. Ed Bastian : Off a good year last year. Glen Hauenstein : Yes, off a great year last year. Helane Becker : That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks. Thanks team. Very helpful. Operator : Conor Cunningham, MKM Partners. Conor Cunningham : Hi everyone. Thanks for the time. You've really invested in the operation over the years and just the customer experience in general. And maybe this is a follow-up to what Mike was getting to. Just, there's been a lot of meltdowns around you. And I'm just curious on how you, as Delta, go after those customers that have maybe been displaced by another airline. I think about like Boston this past week and just curious on how you attract them and make them permanent Delta passengers. Ed Bastian : Well, thanks, Conor. I think, again, throughout the pandemic, we have, as Glen said, been the most disciplined in the return of supply and have -- probably have a better match to demand than anyone else. And it's been interesting to watch because a lot of airlines have taken different approaches over the course of the last two years. Fundamentally, our commitment and our promise to our customers is to give them a great, safe, on-time, reliable experience, and we continue to invest more and more in the premium categories of our aircraft, of our service elements and the quality of our -- of the service that our people drive and it speaks for itself. We take, very humbly, the various awards we've won over the course of the last couple of years. I think we've expanded our leadership during COVID. We had the most to lose, and I think we gained the most over that time frame, candidly. And we've got some really nice momentum as we're bringing and opening new airports. We've got the new LaGuardia opening in June, which will all be very pleased to be the new LAX that we cut the ribbon on with the mayor a couple of weeks ago and the new international facility in Seattle and continued expansions in Salt Lake and improvements in Minneapolis, many other places. So we're going after the customer experience on the ground as well as in the air with a heightened focus on premium. That's about all we can say. Operator : Myles Walton, UBS. Myles Walton : Thanks. Good morning. There are some concerns about looking forward potential consumer softening through the course of the year. And obviously, you're not seeing that in 2Q. But I was wondering, Ed, if you're looking for signals of softening in your business, do you think it would sort of start to show up first in a lower uptake of premium products? Show up first in maybe leisure roads, demand drying up there or somewhere else. Maybe you can just talk to what you'd look for in your watch tower. Ed Bastian : Well, you're right, Myles, we're not seeing it. But at the same time, we acknowledge our crystal ball is only as good as the next 60 to 90 days or whatever we have in terms of kind of a decent build of bookings on hand. And certainly, the next 60 to 90 days look good, as evidenced by our guidance. So we expect a very strong summer coming through that. Consumer -- the health of the consumer is something we spend a lot of time talking about and watching and looking at. But there's other elements at play here with respect to the consumer. One is that, consumers have not been traveling over the last two years. So this is a category that they're prioritizing as they're looking at where their spend is going into travel. You see it in credit card data, you see it all across the board. And this is not just true at Delta, this is true within our industry. Hotels are seeing it, rental car companies, et cetera. People are looking for experiences. You're seeing a pretty significant shift coming out of goods and retail into experiences and services. And that's not just the fact that people haven't traveled, they've also saved money as they've accumulated some meaningful cash and discretionary income for what they have been doing over the last couple of years. So we feel pretty strongly that we're going to continue to see the strong demand extend beyond just the normal summer surge but into the fall. At the same time, we're watching it. I think the place we've been looking for is pricing resistance. When we start to see pricing, particularly with high input costs like fuel, starting to challenge our demand and supply assumptions, then we'll take the next step-up. For now, we're feeling cautiously bullish about the summer. Myles Walton : Thanks. Great. Thank you. Operator : Next, we'll hear from Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Glen, if I could, on your commentary on yields improving sequentially through the balance of 2Q, I assume that is based on what you're seeing in advanced book yields. Can you just comment on like when you add it all up, not just advanced book yields but also bookings, how would you characterize kind of your visibility into May, June versus a normal time? Is it also running ahead? I mean it's not as snarky as a question as it sounds. I guess my question is, as you offer higher fares out into the any pushback, or are you seeing any hesitancy? Glen Hauenstein : Well, I'd say absolutely not. As a matter of fact, we've been trying to catch up to this robust demand. And our quest in the revenue management team, who I think has done an excellent job in managing this surge, is to not run out of seats as we get towards the peak travel, summer travel season. So we want to have reasonably priced offers in market right up to day of departure and we don't want to be running out of seats. Having said that, we are running ahead in terms of absolute bookings domestically in the rest of the quarter. And so we're actively managing that down a little bit so that we don't run out as we get very close to departure date. So I hope that gives you some color as to what we're looking at right now. But we're, right now, in the mode of trading traffic for yield. Duane Pfennigwerth : That's helpful. And then I don't know if we've seen enough of kind of an off-peak environment yet here in 2Q, but can you contrast for us how are you seeing sort of peak yield improvement relative to 2019 versus off-peak yield improvement? Are you starting to see any, I guess, torque on off-peak? Thank you. Glen Hauenstein : No. As a matter of fact, when you look at where we're booked ahead, we have had the offers slightly ahead in peak days and peak travel periods versus off-peak. And we've seen the consumer demand that you would expect, travelers moving into the off-peak period, but at higher yields. So really, really encouraged by what we see as we head into late spring and summer and we'll see how it actually materializes. But everything we see right now points to a very, very robust travel through the remainder of spring and summer. Q \u2013  Thank you, Glen. Excellent. Operator : Next, we'll hear from Jamie Baker of JPMorgan. Jamie Baker : Yes. Good morning. Glen, a question on premium revenue. What percent is sold at the initial time of ticketing as opposed to during the window between ticketing and departure? And how has that changed over time? Glen Hauenstein : We have moved more and more to ticketing, time of ticketing. So I'd say, and I don't have these numbers, I can follow-up with you, but my guess is that they're around 70% is done at time of ticketing and about 30% post-purchase. Operator : Andrew Didora of Bank of America. Andrew, your line is open, if you can release your mute function. Andrew Didora : Hi. Can you hear me? Operator : We can hear you now. Andrew Didora : Glen, I know it's really early on in the corporate travel recovery, but we've been hearing from some hotel companies that the corporate booking curve has just shortened tremendously. I think they've been mentioning under two weeks versus normally 30 days to 45 days. Are you seeing a similar shortening in the corporate booking curve? And I guess, are you beginning to see any other changes to the way corporates behave here as the recovery unfolds. Thanks. Glen Hauenstein : Yes. I would not say that we're seeing that same phenomenon. Our corporate booking seems -- outside of 21 days now, seems to be trending similarly inside of 2021. So I'd say we're seeing very normal booking curves in terms of business. And I think what we're seeing, and this is more anecdotally than you see in the type of transaction you have, but people's reason for traveling for business is slightly different. We are seeing an increase in meetings, an increase in groups, and I think that may be why hotels are seeing further out APs because it's harder to get big blocks. Andrew Didora : Thank you. Julie Stewart : April, can we please go to the next question. Operator : Savi Syth of Raymond James. Savi Syth : Hey. Good morning. Hello, everyone. Just a quick follow-up to, I think, Brandon's question earlier. So just if you look at the 2Q guide, what's the level of demand recovery that's reflected in that guide? Business demand. Glen Hauenstein : The business demand is in the low 70s. Savi Syth : Okay. Got it. And then just switching a little bit to the regional airline segment. You started a transition in that segment getting back to, I think, 2012. And kind of accelerated here during COVID. I was just curious if you kind of view the kind of the pilot supply issues of the regional industry are facing, are those kind of transitory, or is there a need to revisit the regional airline strategy at Delta? Ed Bastian : Thanks, Savi. Yes, there is certainly a challenge to the business model that the regionals are experiencing. And you're right, we've moved pretty aggressively to transition out of the lower category, the 50-seat regional jet, over the last 10 years. So as a result of that, we have less lift coming out of the regional in terms of aggregate shelves and pilot requirements and staffing obligations than some of our other competitors in the industry. They were down to less than 150-seat regionals, probably meaningfully less, at the present time and we don't intend to grow that. It's going to continue to drop. It's a reset period. I think everyone is dealing with their partners in a certain way. Certainly, it's driving up costs on the pilot side, to keep the pilots in the regional category until we're ready to bring them up to the main lines. But fundamentally, it's still a good business for us. We've got a considerable investment in it, and we're going to do our best to continue to grow it, but not at the lower category. We're happy with our 76-seat product. And to the extent, we can get more of those, we would. Operator : Next, we'll hear from David Vernon of Bernstein. David Vernon : Hey, good afternoon \u2013 or good morning. Dan, I appreciate the color the incremental cost guidance, I think we can back into what that number looks like in absolute dollar terms. Could you give us some sense of what are the risks and upside, downside risks achieving that cost guidance? Do we need international to really kind of reopen on some set schedule, or do you feel pretty good about where we're going to be? And then as a follow-up, as you think about 2022 to 2023, given that we've hired ahead, as Ed had mentioned, resourcing the network, bringing people in, getting the training up, how should we think about that incremental cost in absolute dollars for the next 5% of capacity relative to what we're seeing in the back half of this year? Not looking for guidance, just trying to get a sense for how we think about \u2013 or how we should be thinking about that cost build from 2022 to 2023 given the hiring ahead of this demand recovery that we've seen at Delta. Dan Janki : Yeah. The -- so when you think about it, related to it, the biggest risk when you think about the step-up and step function change that we talked about an opportunity ultimately comes back to capacity. And it's the ASMs that we fly. And so that is the \u2013 and you saw that, as we talked about the first half, we're two points lower on capacity and that translates us to being higher than where we thought we'd be. So put that out there, that's the biggest element of it. That's two-thirds of three-quarters of it. The other quarter of it is driving the efficiency, it's the efficiency in the aircraft, it\u2019s the efficiency in the airport, and facilities and the people, but the biggest one is related to the restoration of ASMs. We're building this to be back restored and it's a progression of that. So we think we're \u2013 when we set the multiyear framework, if you go back to that capital markets, said where we'd be this year, would be 7% to 10%, we'd be low to mid-single digits as it relates to 2023 and then very low single digits as it relates to 2024. That again has you stepping up to being 100% restored in that period of time. So you really have, at that point in time, all that transition expense that we've talked about just now has been sunset, your pull through the restoration, now you're getting the real benefit of running it at 100%. Operator : Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just a follow-up on the previous commentary on the 1Q to 2Q transition, I mean, obviously, your 2Q guidance is pretty strong. Is it fair to say that the kind of extreme peaks that we saw in the back half of 2021 juxtaposed by extreme troughs between it, kind of that is in the past? So when you think of a spring break to summer travel transition, you're not going to see as much of a trough in between those peaks? Is that because of corporate? And kind of what does that mean for your network reliability and your abilities around the airline? Glen Hauenstein : Well, I think one of the issues is moving out of COVID, we probably will not run the peaks as peaky as we had in the past in order to create more efficiency in the network on a year-round basis. And I think we've really come -- we've instituted a lot of plans in that space to try and ease out some of the peakiness of our operational schedules. And I'll give you an example is, historically pre COVID, we operated about 20% more widebodies in the summer than we did in the winter. So when you think about the way that we utilize our pilots or our flight attendants in those categories, that they had very easy rosters in the off-peak and very tensed rosters in the peak. And what we've been really working on during COVID is to come out of this with a more deseasonalized network, so we can improve the asset utilization, flatten out the peaks and build up on the troughs. And we spent a lot of time thinking about that and creating it. And I think as we get to the fall and winter schedules, you'll see how we've dealt with that. I don't want to talk about that right now in detail, but I think those are the real things that we're looking at doing. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll hear from Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Hi. Good morning guys and thank you for the time. It's Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Can you maybe talk about your pricing strategy in this inflationary environment? How you've managed it, how that's changed. And then how you've seen the impact to load factors? I think you said in an earlier question, demand hasn't changed. But obviously, for Q2, the guidance for capacity is still 16% below 2019 level. So maybe can you talk about how you're managing all that in? Glen Hauenstein : Yes. I mean, we don't talk about future pricing as a rule, so we'll stay away from that subject. And I'd just say that when you have stronger demand, you clearly have opportunities on the margin to improve the offer in the marketplace and see if consumers respond to that. And that's really what we've been doing as fuel prices have continued to run up and demand continues to remain strong. So, those levers alone have gotten us to where we feel very comfortable about the 2Q revenue environment. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Great. Thank you. Julie Stewart : Sheila, did you have another question? I'm sorry. That will wrap up the analyst portion of the call. I'll now turn it over to Tim Mapes, our Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, to start the media questions. Tim Mapes : Good morning, everybody. April, if you wouldn't mind reminding everybody about how to ask a question. And we have a lot of energy in the room, if we want to keep the pace of these moving, we'll try to knock out as many of these as possible. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll first hear from Leslie Josephs of CNBC. Leslie Josephs : Hi. Good morning everybody. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the union drive of your flight attendants. There's been a lot of attention on other companies like Amazon and Starbucks. Do you expect your flight attendants to be unionized this year? And what is the impact on Delta? Do you think it helps or hurts your recruiting? And then my second question, are you still charging $200 a month additional for unvaccinated employees' health insurance? Thank you. Ed Bastian : Well, Leslie, on the question with respect to labor and union, this is not new at Delta. We've been the unions for many, many years looking at the Delta employees and have been actively seeking their support. So we, on the one hand, absolutely support our employees to make the best interest -- the best decision that's in their best interest. But at the same time, we know historically that the employees of Delta have been best served by having the direct relationship with our leadership. So we don't -- this is not anything new or different. It's really more of the same. So I wouldn't read too much into what the -- what's going on at Amazon or Starbucks or other places and try to equate that to Delta. It's a very different situation. And we've dropped as of this month the additional insurance surcharge given the fact that we really do believe that the pandemic has moved to a seasonal virus and any employees that haven't been vaccinated will not be paying extra insurance costs going forward. Leslie Josephs : Thank you. Operator : And next, we'll hear from Alison Sider of Wall Street Journal. Alison Sider : Hi. Thanks so much. Just curious what your take is on all the discussions of consolidation among some of the midsized airlines without asking you to comment any specific deal that may or may not happen. Just how would that sort of change the competitive landscape if you did start to see more consolidation among some of these carriers? Ed Bastian : Ali, that's a really good try, but we're not going to bite on that either. Alison Sider : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Next, we'll hear from David Koenig of Associated Press. David Koenig : Hey, good morning. Glen, you said you were hearing good signs, as you put it about Washington perhaps rolling back the pre-departure test requirement. What exactly are you hearing and from whom? And I guess I'd ask the same question about the mask mandate. Glen Hauenstein : Maybe I'll turn that over to Peter, our Chief Legal Officer. Peter Carter : We were obviously engage throughout the administration, and I will tell you that we are getting a strong indication that the testing, the pre-departure testing will be phased out in the near future which is, of course, quite encouraging. Operator : Dawn Gilbertson, USA Today. Dawn Gilbertson : Hi. Good morning. Two questions. First for Glen. There are a lot of questions about pricing resistance. And just a quick check of your fares for a July trip showed $1,500 round trip from Atlanta to Maui, $750 from LAX to Orlando. Are a lot of Americans going to be priced out of vacations this summer? And do you fear any backlash? That's my first question. And the second one is, Ed, you mentioned at the top of the call about travelers' patience? Where are you still seeing issues? And how long before -- I mean, how long will travelers put up, say, with long waits on the phone and other ways to reach you guys? Thank you very much. Glen Hauenstein : Sure. We haven't seen a lot of resistance to the price points that we have in market, and our goal is to have reasonable price points in market up to day of departure. And as we head to the peak, there are going to be constraints on peak days. And so as you shop around, if you're looking for lower fares, you have to be flexible in terms of which days you'd be willing to fly. But as we sit today, we have a load factor cushion versus where we sat in 2019. So we have a higher percentage of our total seats already booked which is, of course, putting a little bit of pressure on the ones we have remaining to sell in terms of increasing the offers on the margin. So look, my advice to travelers is to book early and be flexible if fares are your most important attribute. But what we're seeing more and more is that, that is not the only attribute. The quality of service and that level of service counts more and more. So I hope that answered your question. Ed Bastian : And Dawn, on the question to reservation specifically, if that's what you were asking. We have continued a very, very aggressive drumbeat of hiring in reservations to the point we're now over 50% of our total employees and reservations have been hired just within the last couple of years and we're continuing to grow that. And as our people are getting more experienced and more comfortable, the service levels continue to improve. And we've also invested aggressively in our digital self-service options where, several years ago, maybe only 20% of the reasons people would call us could -- they could actually manage it digitally through self-service channels. Today, that's over 60% of the reasons people call us can be handled digitally. And people are continuing to expand and the adoption of self-service is growing substantially. Obviously, as demand has surged, that continues to put more pressure on the phones. As international is opening, that puts more pressure on the phones. But on balance, our phones are generally even -- and we allocate based on the level of service and the dial-in category, they get responded to the quickest. But on average, the wait times in the phones are less than 30 minutes. Glen Hauenstein : I'd just make one -- the number of transactions that you could actually complete on digital is in the low 80s. The adoption rate is in the low 60s. So continuing to push people. And since you have a direct line to the consumer is encouraging, continue to encourage them to seek a digital answer first rather than calling and waiting on the line because most -- only very complicated transactions now can't be handled digitally. Tim Mapes : With that, April, we have time for one final question before we turn it back over to Ed, please. Operator : Absolutely. Our final question will come from Niraj Chokshi of The New York Times. Niraj Chokshi : Hi. Thank you. I just had two questions on fuel. First, I was wondering if you could speak to the effect of the higher cost of fuel could have on fares. And the other is if there's anything more you could add about sort of the role that refinery playing and helping to offset that? Ed Bastian : I'll take the first question, and Dan can talk to the refinery. It's really a function of demand. To the extent we continue to see very, very strong demand for our product, our ability to push on not just the increased cost of fuel, but all of our cost inputs, we're shortening the time lag between when we experience that cost and when it's in the pricing structure. But it's really a function of demand more so than any decisions that we take on our own. Dan Janki : And then related to the role of refinery as it relates to managing the fuel. 20% of the refinery production is jet, and that jet fuel goes to our New York operations. So it is a direct hedge as it relates to the spreads associated with that. So it's really 100% hedged as it relates to how we run our operations and what it provides. The rest of the 80% production is diesel and gasoline as you go through that process. And so that provides a partial hedge related to of diesel and gas to jet. And so by and large, the refinery when you think about in aggregate as it relates to spreads, it's about a 40% to 50% hedge as it relates to our fuel costs. Niraj Chokshi : Thanks. And just on fares, last month at the JPMorgan Conference, Glen had given an estimate that Delta would need to recover, I think, it was 15% to 20% each way on a $400 round trip average. Are you able to kind of provide any update on that kind of figure given the higher fuel costs now? Ed Bastian : This is Ed again. We \u2013 fares are all over the place, they move every day and fuel prices move every day, so we're not going to track to any specific comment. I think you heard in our remarks that we're actually seeing in pricing today real-time coverage for where fuel costs are. Operator : And now at this time, I'll turn the call back over to our presenters for any additional or closing comments. Ed Bastian : Well, I want to thank you all for joining us. We are thrilled with the performance of our team, the progress we've made in terms of serving the demand that is returning, we've been waiting for two years to see this, and we're ready to go, customers are ready to go, and we look forward to a very, very strong spring and summer season and look forward to speaking to you all in July, when we can report on the second quarter results. Everybody have a good day. Thanks for joining us today. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Delta Air Lines June Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. My name is Cody and I will be your coordinator. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Julie Stewart : Thank you, Cody and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us for our June quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining us today from Atlanta, our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; our CFO, Dan Janki. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta\u2019s performance and strategy, Glen will provide an update on the revenue environment, and Dan will discuss costs in our balance sheet. After the prepared remarks, we will take analyst questions and we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up, so that we can get to as many of you as possible. After the analyst Q&A, we will move to our media questions. Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta\u2019s SEC filings. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I will turn the call over to Ed. Ed Bastian : Well, thank you, Julie and good morning. We appreciate everyone joining us today. In a challenging operating environment for the entire industry, I now want to thank our customers for their patience and understanding as we restore the reliability that you have come to expect from Delta. I will speak more to the operation in a moment, but the good news is that we are making great progress to deliver the best-in-class experience that our customers deserve and I am pleased with our July performance to-date. This morning, we reported June quarter earnings per share of $1.44, with $1.4 billion of operating income and a 12% margin on revenues that were close to 2019 levels. Results improved throughout the quarter with revenue in the month of June 4% ahead of the June 2019 number, with a June month operating margin of 16.5%. So, it was only 3.5 points lower than June of 2019 despite a near doubling in fuel prices and our schedule only 82% restored. We generated $1.6 billion in free cash flow in the quarter, which brings us close to $2 billion year-to-date, reflecting the robust demand environment and enabling further delevering as we work to regain an investment grade balance sheet. June quarter performance represents an important financial inflection and resulted in a profit sharing accrual for our employees. These results are a validation of the dedication of our people who have done an amazing job under the most difficult of circumstances imaginable over the past 2.5 years. We are happy to have been able to reward eligible employees, with a 4% raise on May 1 and we are looking forward to Delta people celebrating well-deserved and meaningful profit-sharing payouts for years to come with our return to profitability. Rebuilding Delta\u2019s operation during an unprecedented surge in customer demand has been a remarkable feat and I am grateful to our people for everything they do on a daily basis. While the demand and revenue landscape is the best we have seen, the operational environment for the entire industry remains uniquely challenged. I\u2019d like to sincerely apologize to those who have been impacted by cancellations, delays and long wait times over the last 2 months. This quarter\u2019s operational performance has not been up to our industry leading standards and restoring operational excellence is our top priority. Steps we have taken include the strategic direction to hold capacity at the June month level for the remainder of this year as well as additional investments to restore operational integrity, including earlier boarding procedures and operational buffers. We are pleased with the progress and July is off to a very good start with a 99.2% completion factor through the first 11 days of the month, which is exactly on par with the same holiday period in 2019. In fact, over the last 7 days of this period, we have had only 25 cancellations worldwide on over 30,000 departures. Over this period, 84% of our flights have arrived on time, as measured within 14 minutes of scheduled arrival. Since the start of 2021, we have hired 18,000 new employees and our active headcount is at 95% of 2019 levels, despite only restoring less than 85% of our capacity. The chief issue we are working through is not hiring, but a training and experience bubble. Coupling this with the lingering effects of COVID and we\u2019ve seen a reduction in crew availability and hire over time. By ensuring capacity does not outstrip our resources and working through our turning pipeline, we will continue to further improve our operational integrity. While our actions delay the improvement we expect in non-fuel cost, we know the best path to driving a competitive cost structure is running a high-quality operation. And the most important point I\u2019d leave with you is that the issues we are facing are temporary. We are already seeing significant improvement and operating in line with our record-setting performance levels of July of 2019. Turning to the revenue environment, strong demand and pricing trends are continuing into the September quarter. We expect revenue to be up 1% to 5% versus 2019 with an 11% to 13% operating margin. Consumer demand continues to maintain strength as we look to the fall and we are seeing steady progress in the return of business and international travel. Like all consumer businesses, we are closely monitoring consumer behavior and have yet to see any meaningful pullback in demand. However, if demand were to weaken, I am confident we have the tools and resources to remain profitable through the cycle. The last time an economic recession hit our business was in 2009 and absent fuel hedge losses at that time, which we no longer utilize, Delta was profitable that year. Comparing then to now, Delta\u2019s business has structurally evolved in significant ways over the last decade, building a trusted and premium consumer brand with proven competitive advantages within a much improved industry. Our revenues are far more diversified with much larger contributions from our premium product offerings and high margin loyalty business as well as our growing MRO and cargo businesses. And our balance sheet and access to capital are much stronger as proven during the pandemic. We have recently made major customer enhancements that will strengthen our brand for years to come, including recent openings this quarter of world class airport facilities at LAX and New York\u2019s LaGuardia Airport, two largest markets for travel in the country as well as new Delta Sky Clubs in key markets. We spent over a decade building our reputation as the most reliable airline globally, but we are not only determined to deliver that same standard of excellence, but are investing to bring it to an even higher level. In the face of the pandemic, financially, we have been profitable over the last 12 months, with margins this summer beginning to approach 2019 levels despite meaningfully lower capacity and a doubling in fuel prices, in my opinion, a pretty remarkable turn in performance. With our results in the first half of the year, we remain confident in our 2024 targets for earnings per share of over $7, more than $4 billion in free cash flow and a return to investment grade metrics. Now, I will turn it over to Glen to talk about the revenue environment. Glen Hauenstein : Thank you, Ed and good morning everyone. I want to start by thanking every one of our employees for their professionalism and the care they deliver to our customers everyday. We are pleased with the return of demand across all categories and regions. Momentum accelerated through the June quarter, enabling the recapture of higher fuel prices. Looking forward, we are seeing demand and pricing strength carry into the late summer and fall as demand remains strong. The success of our customer-focused strategy and strength of the Delta brand is evident in strong June quarter results across our diverse revenue streams, including premium product outperformance and a record quarter for both AmEx remuneration and cargo. We generated $12.3 billion of revenue in the June quarter and achieved a total unit revenue that was 20.5% higher than 2Q of 2019. Revenue compared to 2019 progressed from down 15% in the month of March to up 4% in the month of June, resulting in quarterly revenues that were 1% below 2019 levels. We have seen broad-based demand and yield momentum with each region generating positive unit revenue growth. Premium product revenue continues to outperform and is at 10 point higher than 2019 domestically outpacing the growth in Main Cabin. Domestic consumer revenue remains healthy and is ahead of 2019 levels. International consumer revenue showed significant improvement during the quarter as travel restrictions eased and many countries removed testing requirements, including the United States. Latin America and Transatlantic exceeded 2019 levels in June and the Pacific is accelerating as Korea and Australia have reopened and restrictions are easing in Japan. Business travel continues to improve. During the June quarter, domestic corporate sales were 80% of 2019 levels on a 65% recovery in volume. International corporate sales improved 30 points during the quarter to 65% of 2019 levels, led by the Transatlantic where the recovery is now on par with domestic. Our recent corporate survey results show positive corporate expectations for business travel in 3Q, with several of the least recovered sectors conveying strong optimism for increased travel this fall. As the recovery progresses in these sectors, we expect an outsized impact on our coastal hubs. Our corporate customers expressed increased plans to travel internationally in the second half of the year given the elimination of the pre-departure test requirement for flights returning to the United States. Similar optimism was reflected in Morgan Stanley\u2019s recent Global Corporate Travel Survey, where respondents indicated travel volumes would reach 84% of 2019 levels in the second half of 2022. This is 20 points above the June quarter volumes and over 90% by 2023. As the leading carrier for business travel with a best-in-class product in the air and on the ground, we will benefit disproportionately as the business community continues to reconnect in person. For the September quarter, we expect revenue versus 2019 to be up 1% to 5% on capacity that is 15% to 17% lower, with total unit revenues versus 2019 improving sequentially. For the full year, we expect capacity to be 15% lower than 2019. This is a 5% reduction from our initial guidance. As we move to the back half of the year, we expect stronger corporate and international trends to offset seasonally lower customer demand. With a strong brand and diversified revenue base, Delta is positioned to consistently deliver a revenue and profitability premium to the industry. We expect more than 60% of revenue will come from premium products and non-ticket revenue sources by 2024. Premium continues to lead with load factors and yields higher than 2019. And as we increase the mix of premium seats in our fleet, improve the display and sales channels and see progression in the recovery of business, premium will continue to grow. A structural shift to premium is key to managing through inflation and economic cycles. Historically, more price-sensitive products like Basic Economy, which is currently less than 10% of our sold fares, have struggled to keep up with inflation, while high-value premium offerings performed much better and have proven to be much more resilient through the pandemic. Loyalty to the Delta brand is growing at record levels. We acquired another record number of new SkyMiles members in the quarter and achieved record spend and acquisitions on our AmEx co-brand card. More than 1 in 4 new cards acquired were Platinum and Reserve cards our premium tier is providing another proof point on the growing demand for premium products and brands. AmEx remuneration of $1.4 billion was 35% higher than the June 2019 quarter. And to put this in context, that is more than the remuneration for the full year in 2009. We are on track to receive over $5 billion in remuneration this year from American Express and we remain confident in our 2024 target of $7 billion. The decommoditization of our business, combined with diversifying revenue through the growth of loyalty, MRO and cargo have improved our financial resiliency and cash generation. We entered the second half of the year ahead of many of our commercial goals set at the Capital Markets Day. And we are excited about the opportunities to elevate our performance by extending our advantages and leveraging the Delta platform. Delta has been the most disciplined in restoring capacity and will remain nimble depending on the environment while staying true to our core competitive advantages. With that, I will turn it over to Dan to talk about the financials. Dan Janki : Thank you, Glen and good morning to everyone. For the June quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $1.44, operating income of $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion of free cash flow. Our non-fuel unit cost was 21.8% higher than 2019, largely because our network is 18% smaller. Our operating margin was 11.7%. It came in below our most recent guidance as operational disruptions impacted both revenue and fuel prices moved higher. Operating cash flow of $2.5 billion was driven by solid profitability and a sequential build in the advanced ticket sales. Quarterly gross CapEx spend was $864 million. With nearly $2 billion of free cash flow in the first half of the year, we repaid $2.4 billion of gross debt, ending June with $13.6 billion of liquidity and $19.6 billion in adjusted net debt. Our first half financial performance puts us ahead of our initial expectations at the start of the year, supporting our outlook for meaningful profitability in 2022. The exception to this outperformance is our non-fuel unit cost. At Capital Markets Day in December, we laid out a progression to return our non-fuel unit cost structure to within a few points of 2019 by 2024. The actions that Ed spoke about have changed the pace of our unit cost progression but not the destination. The primary drivers are slower capacity restoration and additional investments that deliver the operational excellence. The biggest impact is in the third quarter, where we expect non-fuel CASM to be up approximately 22% versus 2019 on capacity that is 15% to 17% below 2019. For the full year, we now expect non-fuel unit cost to be approximately 8 points higher than we initially guided. The level of capacity restoration accounts for the majority of this increase as we are largely carrying the full cost of the airline, with only 85% of our flying restored. As a result, we are not fully utilizing our assets. For example, third quarter aircraft utilization is about 10% lower than 2019. And while we have over 95% of the employees needed to fully restore capacity, we have thousands in some phase of hiring and training process. The remainder of the increase is driven by investments to support the operation, along with smaller items like higher maintenance and inflation. Actions related to reliability include added operational buffers and over time. Premium pay and over time is expected to total over $700 million this year. This is 50% higher than 2019. While we are delaying our unit cost recovery, it is pace-dependent and within our control. We remain confident in our ability to meaningfully improve our unit cost as we rebuild capacity, improve efficiency and run our operations in line with the Delta high standard. Now, moving to fuel. Second quarter fuel expense increased nearly 60% sequentially on higher prices and volume, with an adjusted fuel price per gallon of $3.82. The refinery continues to provide a hedge to historically high cracks, accounting \u2013 contributing $269 million of operating income during the quarter. This resulted in a $0.31 benefit to our adjusted fuel price per gallon. For the September quarter, we expect the adjusted fuel price per gallon between $3.45 to $3.60. Including a $0.27 per gallon contribution from the refinery based on the forward curves as of last Friday, we expect fuel efficiency to be about 5% better than 2019. Based on our September quarter outlook for revenue and cost, we expect operating margins to be between 11% and 13%. Gross CapEx is expected to be approximately $1.8 billion as we take more aircraft deliveries. We have seen some delays in deliveries and it\u2019s possible this trend continues. Debt reduction remains a key priority. We expect to end third quarter with adjusted net debt of approximately $20 billion. Our goal is to reduce net debt by $5 billion through 2024, bringing us back to investment grade metrics. We remain confident in our ability to make this goal, unlocking significant equity value for our shareholders. In closing, we have made meaningful progress in restoring our financial foundations. With this progress, our opportunities ahead and the resilient demand for air travel, we remain confident in our 2024 financial targets. In closing, I\u2019d like to thank the Delta people for their hard work, the service they provide our customers day in and day out. Our people will always be the Delta difference. With that, I will turn it back over to Julie for questions. Julie Stewart : Cody, can you please remind the analysts how to queue up for a question and start the Q&A? Operator : Absolutely. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jamie Baker : Hey, good morning everybody. So Dan, building on the prepared remarks, what needs to happen in order to achieve the 2023 capacity plan? Being flat with 2019, you are running well below right now, which you could see training bottlenecks presumably ease at some point, but the pilot shortage seems more acute than at Capital Markets Day. Regional is cutting back. You mentioned delivery delays. Maybe there is a utilization issue that I am not modeling for. I am just trying to assess the feasibility of getting back to 2019 capacity next year and given the implication that, that would have on ex-fuel CASM? Dan Janki : Yes, certainly. And we can talk about the feasibility of getting back and really the progression of non-fuel CASM. Maybe I\u2019d start with the framework when you think about the total year with the 8 points, we had originally guided 7 to 10, picked 9 points as the starting point, you add the 8, that\u2019s 17. And when you think about that, we did that on capacity that was 85% restored. You assume you step up to that 100%, that\u2019s 15 points of capacity restoration. That drives 12 points improvement in that as you get that utilization of your resources and your capability. Now as I talked about in the prepared remarks, not about the hiring, as Ed talked about, it\u2019s really, we have 95% of the people will be substantially complete with that hiring and training as we move through the second half by year end, so we will be well positioned for that 100%. Additionally, there is 2 points in there of rebuild that we are incurring to do that, to bring those employees on, to hire them, to train them. And as I talked about, we are running over time and premium 50% higher than 2019 and that was a level that was already elevated. So you take that out, that\u2019s another 2 points. So that\u2019s 14 point improvement by just better leveraging your infrastructure utilization and the sun-setting of that rebuild off that 17 and that, along with \u2013 we are certainly going to continue to invest back in the airline. We laid out at Capital Markets Day around the airports and that capability continue to have that marker in there as it relates to escalation around our workforce and the components around that and managing our supplier inflation that really puts you in that single-digit level for 2023 on a run-rate basis. So, it really comes back to we are building it to be fully restored. We will have those assets on. It\u2019s really then dependent on bringing that capacity online. Jamie Baker : And that\u2019s fully restored on a full year basis or fully restored by the fourth quarter of 2023? Ed Bastian : Hey, Jamie, this is Ed. Let me jump in for a moment. Jamie Baker : Hi, Ed. Thank you. Ed Bastian : Good questions. I thought Dan did a good job laying out that \u2013 this is entirely within our control, if there is an underlying sentiment that we have kind of lost something in the operating prowess, I don\u2019t see that at all. It\u2019s not a full year number of 23 in terms of capacity. We are going to pace it to demand. I think, in my opinion, by summer of \u201823 would be our target to get back to 100%. I think we could do it maybe a little earlier or a little later depending on what we see in the economy, what happens is the last phases of the restoration of the industry comes together. But I think we have all the piece parts together. We just are very careful that we not incur any of the disruptive influences and elements that we saw during that 6-week period from mid-May to June. And we are going to stay within our capabilities. So I don\u2019t think there is anything that\u2019s outside of our control here. Jamie Baker : Okay. Thank you for that. And just a real quick follow-up for Glen, the strength in premium, any changes in how consumers are purchasing premium products? Is the percent sold at initial ticketing and the subsequent percent sold pre-departure, is that staying the same? I\u2019m just wondering if the inflationary backdrop is causing any changes in the buying patterns of premium. I realize the aggregate outcome remains very encouraging. Glen Hauenstein : No. We had record load \u2013 paid load factors in every one of our premium cabins during the quarter. We had record yields. The travel patterns are pretty sustainable in terms of most of it still being purchased at time of purchase. Actually, the encouraging factor is the continued momentum in corporates authorizing premium travel for their employees who are traveling frequently. So as we move into September, we expect that to continue as we get back into a more seasonal business travel market. Jamie Baker : That\u2019s great. Thank you to all three of you. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Andrew Didora : Hey, good morning, everyone. First question for Glen. So it seems like the June trend is continuing into 3Q here. But can you comment a little bit on what you\u2019re seeing into your September bookings and kind of how you view the pace of unit revenues throughout the quarter? I would think you\u2019re baking in a September that is probably lower than July, August. Am I right on that? And then any thoughts that you could provide around how you\u2019re thinking about the corporate and leisure recovery come the fall would be helpful as well? Thanks. Glen Hauenstein : Well, our thesis is really what I outlined in my comments that as we get towards the end of summer into the more traditional business travel season, that we\u2019re going to see an uptick in corporate travel. And that\u2019s been reinforced by a couple of surveys. The Delta survey, which really just closed last week, had some very encouraging statistics in that our customers are expecting that travel will pick up meaningfully as we get to the fall. I think the other piece is the international and the rebound of international. That was delayed and came later than the rebound at domestic. And as we look out to September, we have some really very, very strong data points in terms of travel for international for September. As a matter of fact, September, what we have on the books today, which is about 60% of the total bookings for international, is at record levels much higher than what we experienced in June. So that piece, which we already have in our books is very, very strong, and then we\u2019re just anticipating that there is a shift from high, high demand leisure to a little bit better mix of corporate versus leisure demand in the fall. Andrew Didora : Got it. Makes sense. And then look, obviously, everyone is trying to find the cracks out there the in-services spend. Obviously, you have a big partner in Amex that has kind of a lot of data around this. How are you working with Amex to maybe identify potential areas of weakness in the consumer? What are they telling you about how consumers could behave in the back half of this year? Glen Hauenstein : Amex is our closest and best partner and we talk to them constantly and they are not seeing any indications yet. And I think we\u2019re all looking for it. But as of now, I think we\u2019re enjoying the very, very robust demand that\u2019s not only in our spend, airline spend but in our whole portfolio, Amex portfolio spend as well. Ed Bastian : Andrew, this is Ed. Let me add to Glen\u2019s comments. I spoke to some of the media last night, this morning about this as well. There is such pent-up demand for our product. You\u2019ve got to remember, people have not had access to our product for the better part of 2 years, many \u2013 particularly business and some higher end consumers. And we\u2019re not going to satisfy that quench, that thirst in a space of a busy summer period. So there is a lot in there that is yet to come. But that is our thesis, as Glen mentioned. And yes, the data supports what we\u2019re seeing today, but we also acknowledge that our crystal ball is only about 3 to 4 months right now and it doesn\u2019t go all the way as far as people would like us to think. But everything we see tells us that we\u2019ve got to run \u2013 the only fly in the ointment, in my opinion, is that we don\u2019t run a quality operation. I mean, that will keep people from the product. And that\u2019s why we are so focused on delivering a high-quality operation, which is exactly what our team is delivering and that will continue to deliver. And the second thing, and it\u2019s been talked about in the industry and we talked about it last Investor Day is not just the move from goods to service spend because our economy is a lot larger today than it was in 2019, regardless of whatever you think that GDP is, whether we\u2019re already into the technically mild recession or not at the present time. I think by most estimates, our economy is about 15% higher than what it was in 2019. And our industry is only about 90% to 95% restored. That\u2019s a pretty big cushion or delta or hedge, depending on your point of view in terms of where the demand strength will be supported. And for Delta, it\u2019s even lower because we\u2019re only about 85% restored. So when you put all those factors together, it gives us confidence that we\u2019re going to see continuing strength. We will see some seasonal shift, as Glen mentioned. But I don\u2019t think the season will be as pronounced as it\u2019s been in the past. And we expect, as long as we run a high-quality operation, which we are doing and we will continue to do, we should be well positioned. Andrew Didora : Great. Thank you everyone. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Dan, can you help us on the 22% CASM in third quarter going to around 10% in Q4? Can you help us sort of bridge to that? And then as I look out to the 2023 CASM guide you gave at Capital Markets Day, I understand the impact of we will see how much capacity we can add back. But if I look this year, CASM is 8 points worse on 5 points less capacity, so there is, call it, 3 points of sort of underlying cost. Should we just take that 3 points and add that to 2023 or can some of that go away as well? Dan Janki : Yes, two pieces. Let me bridge it first to fourth quarter and the step down, going to come out, I talked about and run capacity at our June levels as we go \u2013 progress through the back half of the year. As you do that and you run that consistently, you get relative restoration in the fourth quarter. So capacity was to be stepped up to be 94% restored, a 10-point step up from the midpoint of our range. So when you do that, that\u2019s where you get that relative improvement as it relates to capacity and efficiency and utilization relative to 2019, that along with a stepdown in some of the rebuild expenses in the quarter, that gives you your over your 10-point improvement really gets you to that 10% level as we go into \u2013 as we go and execute through fourth quarter. That was the first one. The second one, when you think about that, yes, there are \u2013 we\u2019re building ahead. So some of that cost that you are seeing on those 3 points are costs that were occurring ahead related to it. Some of it is the additional point that I talked about in rebuild. We\u2019re incurring more overtime and more premium to run the airline this year. So you\u2019d expect that one \u2013 those costs to come out. So it\u2019s both making the investments in and those rebuild costs that will diminish that you\u2019ll see improvement in. One of those costs is we put cost in, in regards to our reporting practices and the changes associated with that. Yes, that\u2019s an increase, but that\u2019s going to be efficiencies for us throughout our network in regards to how we run and operate that throughout the system. And we did a lot of work \u2013 the operating teams did a lot of work to test that. validate that, and we know we will get those efficiencies as we go forward. Scott Group : Okay, thanks. And then just second question, just more about the third quarter guide. So it sounds like June had revenue up 4% and margins of 16%, and I\u2019m sure there was some impact from operational issues. It sounds like that\u2019s getting better and fuel is coming down. Just I\u2019m trying to understand the 11% to 13% margin guidance for Q3 relative to that 16% in June. So any thoughts there would be great? Thank you. Dan Janki : The \u2013 you have... Ed Bastian : Talk about the month of June. Dan Janki : For the month of June. As you think about \u2013 let me \u2013 July will be a lot like June and then you step down as you progress through. So the June, July, you get that momentum, but then you get the seasonality and the step-down that Glen talked about regarding top line as you progress through the rest of August and September. And then the other element in there as you think about guide, we also \u2013 so that \u2013 and underneath that, remember, we\u2019re coming off at June capacity rate. So we have underlying volume growth associated in that, about 7% to 8% associated with that. So you\u2019re getting bridge on that. Ed Bastian : I think the other thing, Scott this is Ed in there, that we have a pretty significant profit sharing accrual also in the September quarter. In June, most of the results were offset by the loss in the first quarter of the year. So we have profit sharing accrual but it\u2019s modest. I think we\u2019re looking at close to another $200 million, plus or minus, at these guidance levels of additional expense for profit sharing, which also affects a little bit of the trend there. Scott Group : Okay, very helpful. Thank you, guys. Appreciate the time. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from David Vernon with Bernstein. David Vernon : Hi, Dan. Just to kind of stick on the cost outlook here. So we\u2019re looking for up low to mid-singles, we\u2019re ending \u201822 up 18, I guess, sort of 15, 18, whatever the number is, a little bit worse than were before. Just can you help us kind of understand like are we still looking up to low to mid-single digits off of the costs that have been pulled forward or should we be expecting that to moderate a little bit? And then as you think about those \u2013 the overtime and the costs that have been put in ahead of the demand recovering, is there going to be some sort of deceleration in some of that cost even kind of independent of the volume as we kind of think about the back half of this year or is that going to also be pushed into 2023? Dan Janki : You see that step-down slightly in fourth quarter on that. And then it really, really starts to sunset as you flip the calendar and move into 2023 related to that. So you certainly do. The first part of the question, I missed the very beginning of it. David Vernon : So as you look at \u2013 we were \u2013 I think the guidance from the Capital Markets Day was up low to mid-singles on unit cost. Should we be kind of moderating that because of the 2022 sort of outperformance on cost or is it still sort of in that same kind of range from a directional standpoint? Dan Janki : Yes. I think it\u2019s \u2013 again, as we talked about, the destination 24 hasn\u2019t changed in regards to it. It will be pace-dependent. As Ed talked about, it\u2019s in our control, putting the cost in ahead. It will be really when that capacity comes in and the pace of that capacity that comes in that will dictate that as we progress through 2023. So we will have to \u2013 as we get to the end of this year, we\u2019re going to look at that capacity and how we bring it on, and that will pace how the calendar falls out associated with it. But we expect that the leverage that we\u2019re going to get in the incremental CASM to be right in line with where we\u2019re expecting it, so yes, no change in leverage. David Vernon : And Glen, maybe just to kind of shift gears for a second and talk about corporate. As you think about the way corporates are buying, are you seeing a return to sort of close-in travel? Or is that \u2013 has that changed a little bit, the booking windows being a little bit more elevated? And how does that think of \u2013 and how does that change the load factor you ought to be running the operation at or does it have any impact on that? Glen Hauenstein : What we\u2019ve seen is a little bit of an elongation of the booking cycle. I think that is also dependent on the relaxation of the cancellation fees. I think one of the things that we didn\u2019t talk about is when you look at our quarterly results here, remember, we have no change fees, and that was $1 billion that we had to overcome in the bottom line. So I think we\u2019re all learning what the new world is without change fees, and we\u2019re seeing some change in travel patterns in terms of APs and in terms of stays. But I think we\u2019ve got that well managed. And we are going to run load factors that I think are very similar to 2019 levels throughout the rest of the third quarter and likely into 4Q. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Hey good morning guys and thank you. If we think about the overtime pay in the $700 million range for the full year, how much of that was incurred in the first half? And how do we think about it for the remainder of the year, just given the operational adjustments you\u2019ve made? Dan Janki : Yes, it\u2019s pretty balanced. I would say second and third quarter were the highest with it stepping down slightly that we anticipated in fourth quarter as we stabilize and run the operation. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Okay, great. And then as a follow-up to that, I appreciate you guys have the hardest job on the planet here. But how do we think about flex options as we think about labor and salaries, just the number of employees you guys have in 2023, just given the potential different economic scenarios we might have next year? How are you guys planning for that? Ed Bastian : Sheila, this is Ed. Let me take a stab at that. Obviously, we haven\u2019t given \u201823-specific guidance. We\u2019ve given you ranges and direction but we haven\u2019t given you guidance. I\u2019m going to defer on getting into any detail as to labor in \u201823, what the cost implications are. We mentioned at the Capital Markets Day that we do have long-term cost growth built into our model, and that is true for all of our work groups. We will see how the year progresses. Obviously, we\u2019re in the midst of a pilot contract negotiation, which I\u2019m not going to speak to publicly. So we will learn more as we go, but I don\u2019t see anything to lead me to believe that the core elements of what we described back in December are going to be that much different when you get to \u201824, what the trajectory is. And one other thing, I know a lot of it \u2013 Dan has been getting a lot of the questions on cost, which I fully understand. But thinking about it from our seat, the last 2 years, we\u2019ve been all about trying to drive down cost. And I think our team has done a really good job. In fact, for the better part of the pandemic, we had over 50% of our cost out, which was unheard of, showing the unforeseen flexibility which we\u2019re going to avail ourselves to once we get the operations stabilized. And my direction has been to stabilize and drive reliability. And now that we have demand like we haven\u2019t seen ever before as well, all hands are on deck to support and serve that demand. We\u2019re going to get to equilibrium over the course of the next 12 months, where cost and revenue and everything is going to be in balance. I\u2019m confident we\u2019re going to end up in a better net spot on at all. But when you have revenues already surpassing 2019 levels, it\u2019s hard for the operations to make sure we have enough staff on hand and the focus there. So there is also a lot of costs that are embedded within the system that are hard to tease out but are a function of a very, very intense period of time that we\u2019re under. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our next question from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, Ed. Maybe expanding on that answer, obviously, it was a challenging operational period in 2Q. But you mentioned it yourself your employment levels are close to 95% recovered. I think your own disclosure of pilot headcount is actually kind of flat with where you were in 2019. So can you speak more to maybe what unfolded? What\u2019s changed in July? And thinking about it from a brand perspective and a premium revenue perspective, obviously, if you incur a lot more cancellations and queuing at Sky Clubs and things like that, doesn\u2019t that erode that ability in the future? So how are you, I guess, protecting that moving forward? Ed Bastian : It absolutely does erode that into the future. That\u2019s the risk, Brandon. I agree with that. What we\u2019ve seen in July as compared to that last 6 weeks at the end of the second quarter is some different scheduling practices that we\u2019ve taken within all of the work categories, including our pilots, our flight attendants and others. We\u2019ve made schedule adjustments as well. We\u2019ve taken any growth out. We\u2019re positioned not just for the next month or so. We\u2019re positioned for the balance of this year to kind of stay where we\u2019re at, and that level of stability gives the operations the capability to focus on the task at hand rather than continuing to invest and build on growth at the same time. We will build \u2013 we\u2019re going to have the capacity to grow when we\u2019re ready, but we want to make sure we\u2019re focused on serving what we have. And it\u2019s really remarkable being in this business for 25 years now. You run a better airline, everything runs better and the efficiencies start to materialize, that over time goes away on its own. The lines start to move quicker. And we can also accelerate the training and the experience of our team. When you think about the fact that we\u2019ve got 18,000 new people that have joined us, many of them over the last 12 months, there is a lot of experience that they are gaining, and that experience and scale is going to pay off. But you don\u2019t step into these jobs and you learn it overnight. There is a significant learning factor that we\u2019re also going through. And that\u2019s \u2013 whether it\u2019s in the airports with what you guys see or what\u2019s going on behind the scenes in tech ops or in reservations or in all categories of employment, even technology. So you see all behind the scenes, all the moving parts of how much new folks, new leadership we have in place, it\u2019s breathtaking. And I\u2019m optimistic they are doing a really good job, but there is a pretty big learning curve. It\u2019s hard to put a dollar amount against, but I know it\u2019s going to really pay off as we move forward. Brandon Oglenski : I appreciate that. I will just keep it to one. Operator : Thank you. We will go ahead and take our next question from Helane Becker with Cowen. Helane Becker : Hello. Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody and thank you very much for the time. So one question is related to when you add time, which is what I assume you\u2019re doing in changing the boarding process, you\u2019re adding time between flights. Does that exacerbate pilots and flight attendants running out of time? Does it help baggage handling? Like how should we think about that? I think Dan, you already talked to the cost side. But how should we think about that from the actually day of operations side? Ed Bastian : I\u2019ll take that. It doesn\u2019t, Helane. Obviously, it\u2019s a fact \u2013 you got to look at the full impact on overall utilization. Obviously, utilization comes down a touch. So it\u2019s embedded into the aircraft utilization. Dan talked about our aircraft utilizations already having been down versus \u201819, and we\u2019re capitalizing a little bit on that to take advantage of some boarding time. But the fact of the matter is that the \u2013 we were running with the large narrow-bodies in the domestic system, too hot in the airport environment. We didn\u2019t have enough time for our customers. And this is just recognizing the reality of the operation, which we\u2019re already running, which enables everybody to get in position ahead of time. And yes, we\u2019re tweaking show in times, reporting times and when the actual assets are being operated. But it doesn\u2019t really change a lot in the dynamics, it\u2019s going to give our people a little more time to board promptly. It\u2019s also giving us the opportunity, which we haven\u2019t been able to fully take advantage in the past actually to depart early when ready. And we\u2019re seeing that in meaningful ways. It\u2019s improving bags performance. I think the only pinch point we\u2019re seeing is making that we analyze make certain we had enough time to get the cleaners off the planes because we\u2019re not going to compromise on cleaning either. And so this has been worked on for the better part of the last year. It wasn\u2019t something we thought of overnight. And I think we\u2019re fully plugged in across all of the operating groups, that it\u2019s going to be a better customer experience, can be a better employee experience. And behind that, it\u2019s going to be a better brand experience as well. Helane Becker : That\u2019s very helpful. And then just for my follow-up question is on what kind of technology can you use to speed the boarding process? I know you were working with biometrics and doing some of that leading-edge stuff pre pandemic and then even during the pandemic. But can you accelerate your IT spend to speed the process up and help day of operations, I wonder? Ed Bastian : We\u2019re doing that. We\u2019re certain a lot of that\u2019s on the front end coming through security. And you may have seen that we\u2019ve added additional biometric processes and face ID and helping working with CLEAR and TSA to get customers through the security queues faster. At boarding at the moment, I don\u2019t see any magic bullets to get physically the number of people that we have on the plane and seated with their bags stowed that much sooner. But we\u2019re trying to make it more comfortable process. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be faster, but hopefully, it will be more comfortable. Helane Becker : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our next question from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Mike Linenberg : Yes. Hey. Good morning everyone. Hey, Glen, I want to go back to the point that you made where you talked about some of the revenue segments that you were \u2013 that you focused on, to some extent, a hedge against inflation. You talked about basic economy being under 10%. How has that progressed over, say, the last few quarters as inflation has picked up and presumably some of the more price-sensitive passengers are just getting crowded out by your premium customers. Can you give us sort of a sense of how that\u2019s trended? Glen Hauenstein : Well, I think you just described what\u2019s happened is as spares came up and as inventory controls went into place, while the fares per basic economy were filed, they were not readily available as they were squeezed off by our higher-yielding customers. So, our target has been, and really, these are soft targets, but to have less than 20% of our capacity available on Basic Economy. That\u2019s our very soft kind of macro target that we have. And that\u2019s come down to below 10% or right around 10% as the high demand through the summer has really displaced those customers. That\u2019s a result, not an intent. Mike Linenberg : Okay, great. And then can you give us a sense, if we go back to 2019 and we looked at sort of how many points of load factor on domestic flights connected to international, and sort of where we are today because I would think that there is probably some decent upside there as you start to turn on more of Asia, for example. You are a fairly big connecting airline. Where were we then and maybe where are we now? Glen Hauenstein : So, the domestic portion of international journey is generally about 10% of our total capacity or less [ph]. And that\u2019s about \u2013 it\u2019s right now in the high-single digits. So, that\u2019s a couple of points of load in the domestic system. Mike Linenberg : Okay. All very high margin, I presume, as it comes on? Glen Hauenstein : Absolutely and the recovery has really been led by domestic premium. And now what we are really seeing is the acceleration of international premium as we move into the late summer and the fall. So, very exciting for us. Mike Linenberg : Very good. Thanks everyone. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi Syth : Hey. Good morning. I noticed the kind of used aircraft \u2013 just the used aircraft purchases this quarter. And I was wondering if you could kind of take a step back and as we look to like 2023, \u201824 kind of plan and maybe even a little bit beyond, guessing that the small RJ reduction in your fleet is probably faster than you had expected back at Investor Day. I am just kind of curious what the holes you have in the order book? Essentially, what do you need in terms of growth or replacement compared to what you have in the order book today? Like what could we expect in terms of additional either used or new aircraft that needs to be added to your outlook? Ed Bastian : Savi, this is Ed. We are reasonably good placed with the order book. Obviously, we have opportunity in the next 3 years to 5 years of delivery for some additional narrow-body, large narrow-body acquisitions, and that\u2019s something that we are always talking to Airbus and Boeing about and whether that\u2019s used or whether that\u2019s new, there is opportunity there. On the wide-bodies, we have focused a lot of our energy in the last few years on the wide-body and specifically the 350 and the 330, and we are pleased with the used 350s that we have acquired. And we have got a pretty healthy stream of wide-bodies coming. So, I would say the focus in the back end of the 5-year period is on the large narrow-bodies. Savi Syth : Alright. Helpful. I will leave it at that. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Stephen Trent with Citi. Stephen Trent : Good morning everybody and thanks for taking my question. Just one quick one here. When we look back earlier this year, there was this ongoing noise about these 5G towers getting installed in our airports. That all seemed to quiet down. And in that sort of general theme, are you seeing anything from other industries or maybe government proposals that are causing some concern at the moment, or have these conversations, whether they are industries, with Secretary Buttigieg and not giving you any sort of concern like that? Peter Carter : Steve, hi, it\u2019s Peter Carter. Thanks for the question. We have a very, I would say, direct and open dialogue with the administration, with the Secretary and the FAA. And we don\u2019t see any, I will say, storm clouds with respect to any of the initiatives that the government has been talking about. You may have seen that the Secretary proposed a bill of rights for passengers traveling with disabilities last Friday. That was just a restatement of existing regulations that Delta has been following. And obviously, we do everything we can to make sure that our disabled passengers are taken care of every step of the journey. Stephen Trent : Okay. Really appreciate that color and I will leave it at that. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey. Thanks. Almost fell asleep. Nice to speak with you both. Ed, with a longer term view that operations will kind of normalize and clearly, there is a lot of non-recurring in the baseline this year that your unit costs will normalize into 2023, what sounds like a constructive view on demand, meaningful free cash flow generation this quarter. How do you and the Board think about your stock here in the $20s? I think the plan was to stick to your knitting on deleveraging. But are you shocked with where your equity is trading? And is there any increased emphasis or increased thought on buyback with your stock down here when the restrictions come off? Ed Bastian : Thanks Duane. Yes, I think we are all surprised with where the stock is, for the industry, by the way, it\u2019s not Delta-specific, is trading at. And I think it\u2019s a function of all the distractions or noise, whatever you want to call it. We have got a lot of moving parts in the industry as we get through the last phases of this pandemic. And we see the whipsaw effect, whether it\u2019s extraordinarily high revenue or high cost to serve that revenue and fuel prices. So, there is a lot of moving parts there. We can\u2019t do anything at the moment with respect to CARES Act limitation, so I can\u2019t provide you any specifics on that. But we talk over the long-term that we have got a responsibility to all constituencies, to our customers, to our employees and importantly to our owners as well as our communities. And our owners shouldn\u2019t be forgotten about and we didn\u2019t forget about them during the pandemic. We did not dilute. Our owner\u2019s one of the only airlines that didn\u2019t do that. So, it\u2019s an important point to us, but at this point in time, I really can\u2019t speak much about that. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay. And then maybe just one last one on Transatlantic, some constructive comments from Glen, but can you talk about recovery sort of U.S. point of sale versus Europe point of sale and how you see that sort of changing over the balance of the year? Thanks for taking the questions. Glen Hauenstein : Right. Well, I am glad I got this question because I actually the first. So, thank you for the question. Duane Pfennigwerth : You\u2019re welcome. Glen Hauenstein : I think one of the issues is with the euro portion parity is what are we seeing in terms of EU point-of-sale and EU demand set. And what I would say is that \u2013 right now, the difference between EU point-of-sale and U.S. point-of-sale in terms of referencing back to \u201819, they are almost identical in terms of the fare increases that we have realized. Now, one of the things I historically never understood is most things in Europe are more expensive than they are in the U.S. on a dollar-adjusted basis. Airfares in Europe to the United States were never one of those. So, we have gotten some leverage here where we have gotten some nice fare initiatives and structures in place that are taking some of that disparity out of the U.S. point of origin versus the European point of origin. So, I think we like where we sit. I think the one concern is right now, we are in a high U.S. point-of-sale. Everybody likes to go to Europe in the summer. And as we shift to the fall, late fall, certainly that extends throughout the October season. But as we get into the November through February, I would just like to point out it would be a great time for you to go to Europe. And the after-Christmas sales would be very good and you would be \u2013 your dollar would go further than ever. So, we will keep a close eye on that balance as we move in, given the fact that the euro has weakened substantially. But that\u2019s something I think we can accommodate through capacity offering. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Question for Glen or Dan. What percentage of your corporate contracts right now are still grandfather contracts, i.e., pricing from pre-pandemic levels where there could potentially be an opportunity to renew at much higher yields? Glen Hauenstein : Well, most of our contracts are based off of published fares and inventory that\u2019s available in those published fares, so it floats. And so I think what we are seeing and when you look at 65% recovered in terms of volume and 80% in terms of sales, you see that we are getting a lot of yield momentum on the corporate side as well. So, hopefully, as we get into the fall and corporate continues to return, we can realize those increased fares that are in the market today. Ravi Shanker : Got it. Thanks for the clarity. And maybe just one follow-up. Obviously, thank you for all the commentary on how you expect 3Q to pan out. But just wanted to confirm that based on the visibility you have in the booking curve right now, which I think should give you at least three months of visibility, you are not seeing any drop-off in domestic leisure demand post Labor Day beyond normal seasonality. Is that a fair comment? Ed Bastian : That\u2019s fair. Ravi Shanker : Great. Thank you. Julie Stewart : We will go \u2013 we will now go to our last analyst question. Operator : Thank you. We will take our final analyst question from Chris Stathoulopoulos from Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead. Chris Stathoulopoulos : Good morning everyone. Thanks for getting me in here. So, Ed or Dan, there was some news out recently about Boeing perhaps getting close to doing a sizable end orders. And I understand if you don\u2019t want to comment on it. We might hear more on Farnborough over two weeks. But that would \u2013 I think if I understand, that would put that first delivery in 2025. And I am just trying to understand, if there is a pilot shortage out there, the consensus view out through mid-decade, which is a gating factor for domestic ASMs, could you just sort of frame, what is the peak year, if you will, for retirements for your current pilot workforce? Ed Bastian : So, you raised a lot of speculation in your questions, so I will be careful to just speak to what I can. We don\u2019t have a massive reduction or retirement bubble in the Delta pilot or we have pilots retiring each year over the next handful of years. We were the only airline that offered a significant retirement inducement for our pilots. And close to 2,000 of our pilots took them back in the summer of 2020. And it\u2019s easy to have a revisionist history and wonder whether we should have done that or not should have done that. But you put yourselves back in summer of 2020 when the total revenues were probably less than 20% of 2019 levels. There was no knowledge of what a vaccine could do, when it would be found, the effectiveness, etcetera, and how the world was going to start to reunite. So, I don\u2019t look back with any regret at all about those decisions. That said, when you take out 2,000 pilots, you could imagine most of them are \u2013 were at the senior-most levels of the company, that causes churn at a much higher level of Delta than other airlines because we effectively wind up training everybody at some point over the following couple of years because everyone will have an opportunity to move up and move to different categories and the like. So, we have done a good job of bringing in the next 2,000. We have many of them hired. We saw \u2013 we had some to go, but we are through much of that. I don\u2019t see any pilot shortage issue for Delta at all. It is the place pilots want to come to. And certainly by the period of time that you were speculating on the latter part of \u201825, \u201826, \u201827, I think we will be in a great spot with respect to our pilot staff. Chris Stathoulopoulos : Okay, I appreciate that. Just a follow-up. So, your survey work, I think you mentioned in your prepared comments, is fairly constructive post Labor Day and your answer to Ravi\u2019s question echoes that. But in your survey work, I know you do a lot of very detailed survey work. Have you looked at travelers that have not yet flown during the pandemic and for those that have the frequency? Just trying to get a sense here for kind of look at this sort of pent-up demand from another angle using some of the survey work from the leisure side that you have done over the last few months? Thank you. Ed Bastian : Yes. The survey work Glen mentioned was largely around corporate travel that we spend an awful lot of time with. We also survey SkyMiles customers, and we have an active survey dialogue going on there. And there is still pretty \u2013 some meaningful pent-up demand there. It\u2019s not just people that haven\u2019t traveled. It\u2019s volumes of trips that we anticipate people will take looking forward as they start to catch up on all the experience and all the opportunities that they lost. When you think about this pent-up demand, it feels \u2013 it sounds very personal. It actually is very personal. It\u2019s people investing in themselves to go see friends and family and have life experience that they haven\u2019t had time. I can\u2019t put how many weddings are being held now. All the reasons why people travel have not gone away. They have just been deferred and now they are being accelerated in the next period of time. So, whether it\u2019s the next 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, there is a lot of catch-up to be done. And every data point we look around indicates that. People aren\u2019t fearful of traveling. I mean there is still some, but it\u2019s a significantly shrinking number. But there is a lot of people that once they are now out on the road, they want to get back on the road. And the only inhibitor that I see, that I hear about is running a quality operation, and we are taking that off the table as a risk factor for our customers. Chris Stathoulopoulos : Thank you. Julie Stewart : That will wrap up the analyst portion of the call. I will now turn it over to Tim Mapes, our Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, to start the media questions. Tim Mapes : Thank you, Julie. Cody, if we could, as we thank the analysts for their time this morning and transition to questions from the media, just remind the members of the media of what our process is, and we will try to get four or five questions answered while we have time here. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Alison Sider with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead. Alison Sider : Hi. Thanks so much. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you are seeing with fares. The CPI data came out this morning and it seems to show some softening. Does that \u2013 have you seen that? Does that reflect any softening demand or more resistance to higher fares, or is it just fuel prices coming down? Glen Hauenstein : We don\u2019t really generally talk about future fares. So, I would like to stay away from that. What we see is a very robust demand set and our ability to harness that through both pricing and inventory in the future. So, I think we expect a very strong demand set to last through the remainder of the summer and into the fall. And as Ed indicated in his previous comments, we do believe there is a lot of pent-up demand for people who maybe didn\u2019t make it in the summer or got priced out of the summer who will be able to travel in the fall\u2026 Alison Sider : Okay. And then just also curious if you are seeing any issues with replacement parts, including engines, are you seeing any lack of availability of spare parts and is that causing any operational issues? Dan Janki : Certainly, when you think about the supply chain as it relates to aviation, it has been \u2013 it certainly has been challenged. It\u2019s been well documented from that perspective. We certainly have seen disruptions. It\u2019s forced us to think about how we \u2013 the inventory levels that we carry. We are fortunate that our team has deep expertise and has been doing this for years, where they are able to navigate that where it hasn\u2019t impacted, in any way, entry into service or availability of aircraft in a material way. It\u2019s allowed us to fly what we wanted to fly. But it\u2019s certainly ongoing. We certainly see those disruptions. We feel them. We work closely with our OEM partners on that and to ensure that we are at the top of the list, but we are working proactively with them to increase the flow. But it\u2019s day-to-day. Alison Sider : And is it especially engines or other products that have been a particular challenge? Dan Janki : It cuts across both engines and components. Operator : Thank you. We then move on to our next question from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Mary Schlangenstein : Hi. I want to try to follow-up really quickly on Ali\u2019s question. With the CPI report showing that fares fell in June after three straight months of double-digit increases. So, I know you don\u2019t want to comment specifically on fares, but could you just comment on, is that a signal now that being able to continue to increase fares across the industry is likely being limited? And a second quick question. I wanted to see if you would comment on the report that you are close to a deal for a dozen or so new A220s with Airbus? Thank you. Ed Bastian : Hi Mary, this is Ed. I think Glen answered it well. I didn\u2019t look at the CPI report yet that came out this morning, but I think that measure is kind of going from month-to-month. And when you think about our selling season, we are selling now into the latter part of the summer, early fall already, which seasonally is a little less amount of demand than what we have seen on the front end of the spring and summer surge. So, I don\u2019t \u2013 the fare environment, it continues to be healthy. It\u2019s not something that we would talk about, but it is \u2013 you can see in our guidance for Q3, the demand is quite strong. On your question relative to future acquisitions, as you know, we don\u2019t comment on such matters. Mary Schlangenstein : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Leslie Josephs with CNBC. Leslie Josephs : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On the training and experience backlog, can you provide a little more detail on how that affected you financially, operationally? And also where are you in hiring? Do you still \u2013 do you have any hiring goals for this year, or do you think that the pace is going to start to slow anything surrounding your plans would be helpful. Thanks. Ed Bastian : Yes. On the \u2013 a lot of it\u2019s in training and we will talk about pilots. We have an enormous amount of pilot activity and training going on. I am not sure the exact number, but at any one point in time, we have 1,500 or more pilots in training, which is much larger than we would normally carry. And by the way, it\u2019s not just the training because you have pilots waiting to be trained, that are sitting on reserves. So, there is a backup there as well in the process. So, it really impacts your overall productivity and efficiency. That will eventually sort itself out as we move through \u2013 move the snake \u2013 the bubble through the snake here and we get to the other end of that. It\u2019s going on with technicians, with mechanics. It\u2019s experience we see with our vendors, our contractors, their ability to repair parts. They are having some of the issues with experience the same way we have new people learning. So, it touches every part of our operation. And the good news is that we have got all our folks. And so we are at peak with respect to \u201ctraining\u201d and I wouldn\u2019t call it inefficiency, but the cost of efficiency. And every month that goes by, it\u2019s going to get better. Leslie Josephs : And in terms of the hiring numbers, do you expect the pace of hiring to slow for the rest of the year, whether being full or\u2026? Ed Bastian : Yes. We are at \u2013 as I mentioned in my remarks, we are at roughly 95% of 2019. There is more hiring to be done in pilots. There is more hiring to be done in flight attendants, in mechanics. The big areas that we are hiring at much larger numbers previously were in the airports and the reservations. And in those two areas, we are largely where we need to be. So, additional staffing, certainly, but that is largely resolved. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Dawn Gilbertson with Wall Street Journal. Dawn Gilbertson : Hi. Good morning. Ed, you gave some really good statistics on the nascent turnaround here in July. I wondered if you or Glen or somebody could talk about the baggage handling situation. I am just hearing anecdotal evidence, not just the Delta on some baggage handling issues, lost bags. Can you share, I mean how is Delta doing in baggage handling and if there are trouble spots, where they are and how you are addressing them? Thanks very much. Ed Bastian : Sure, Dawn. As you can imagine, when you hit a rough patch in your operations, the bags are going to be affected probably even more so than customers. And indeed, that\u2019s what we saw happening in May and June. That said, in July, month-to-date, we are actually ahead of goal that we had set for ourselves in terms of baggage performance. It\u2019s early, but it\u2019s a good indication. We missed our goal by a relatively modest amount in June, the month of June. But one of the things I was impressed with is the Atlanta Airport, which is our biggest baggage center and our biggest customer point was actually ahead of goal for June. So, the baggage issues for us are not domestic. Domestic, our operations are running in a really great place. It\u2019s tended to be more on the European side, where the airports, the European airports have \u2013 don\u2019t have the staff, and they haven\u2019t had the ability to invest ahead of time the way we have had here in the U.S. We are working with our airports, with our partners, with people on the ground. We have gone as far as recently, we had a separate charter just to repatriate bags back to customers that have been stranded because of some of the operational issues the European airports were having. And we did that on our own nickel just to reunite or to help the customers sort their bags as quickly as possible. Dawn Gilbertson : Thank you very much. Dan Janki : Thanks, Dawn. Cody, we have time for one final question, and then we will turn it back over to Ed for closing comments. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will take our final question from Rajesh Singh with Reuters. Rajesh Singh : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. We are told that Delta is in talks with Airbus to expand the existing order for A220s and the deal could be signed next week. Is this accurate and if it is, can you please share the details? Thank you. Ed Bastian : We don\u2019t comment on upcoming decisions that have yet to be taken, so I will leave that at that. Well, I want to thank you all for joining us today. It\u2019s \u2013 there has been a lot happening in our industry and in our business, and it was a very active second quarter. I am proud of the work our team did to deliver a great financial result, a real inflection point as we coined it. And we look forward to a strong third quarter ahead. We will keep a close eye on the operations and encouraged with what we are seeing. And we expect to report even better results when we get to the Q3 report in October. So, thank you for joining us, and hope you have a good rest of your summer. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation today.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Delta Air Lines September Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. My name is Cody, and I'll be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Julie Stewart : Thank you, Cody. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our September quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining us from Atlanta today are CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; our CFO, Dan Janki. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta's performance and strategy. Glen will provide an update on the revenue environment, and Dan will discuss costs in our balance sheet. After the prepared remarks, we will take analyst questions and we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up, so that we can get to as many of you as possible. After the analyst Q&A, we will move to our media questions. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ed. Ed Bastian : Well, thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Before we begin, I want to recognize all of those who have been impacted by Hurricanes Ian and Fiona, including Delta employees who live in the affected communities. We have contributed $600,000 to the Red Cross relief efforts and activated our Delta Care Fund to take care of our employees who have suffered loss. Delta will continue to support our people and our communities [Indiscernible] to recovery and rebuilding. The demand for air travel remains very strong, and that is reflected in today's results and outlook. We generated earnings of $1.51 per share in the September quarter. Our results mark clear financial progress as we report the highest quarterly revenue in Delta's history, 3% above the third quarter of 2019 and $1.5 billion of operating income, generating a 12% margin. This was our second quarter -- consecutive quarter of double-digit operating margins. And importantly, we achieved these results despite record high fuel prices and on capacity only 83% restored relative to 2019. Our customer satisfaction scores are running meaningfully above 2019, and loyalty to Delta has never been stronger, with record SkyMiles acquisitions and American Express results ahead of our plan. I want to sincerely thank the Delta people for their great work in delivering these results and restoring our operational reliability through a very difficult summit, delivering safe, reliable and on-time service for our customers remains our top priority, and no airline does this better than Delta. We saw strong consistent improvement in our operating metrics throughout the quarter. For example, excluding the impact of Hurricane Ian, we ran a 99.9% domestic completion factor in September and month-to-date in October with 90% arrivals on time. To put that in context, out of 120,000 mainline flights over the last 45 days, we had just 108 cancellations in total, performance that is even better than our pre-pandemic levels. And year-to-date, Delta remains in the number one industry position amongst our peer set in completion factor and on-time arrivals. After two years of delaying travel, it is clear that consumers are getting out and traveling the world. Business travel continues to recover in line with our expectations as bookings have improved after Labor Day and companies reconnect with their teams and their customers. And while consumer spend on experiences is growing, the airline industry revenues are still $20 billion to $30 billion below the historical trend against GDP, highlighting the significant opportunity still ahead. We expect our December quarter revenues to maintain this momentum, and we will be 5% to 9% higher than 2019. With strong demand, we expect earnings per share of $1 to $1.25 and a 9% to 11% operating margin. While we face numerous challenges and headwinds this year, Delta has demonstrated its resilience. We're ahead of our plan that we laid out for you last December on profitability and cash flow, and we expect to be free cash flow positive in 2022 this year. Our priority over the next six months is to prepare for full network restoration by next summer, consistent with our original plan, but always conditioned on continuing demand strength. This will support another meaningful step-up in profitability and cash flow next year as we stay on our path to earn over $7 of EPS and $4 billion of free cash in 2024. We'll provide more details on our outlook for 2023 and progress towards our long-term targets at an investor meeting that we will host December 14 in New York. As we think about our long-term plan, we had some really important achievements this quarter. Building on Delta's global network and partnerships, we strengthened our network with the recent DOT approval of our joint venture with LATAM. Together with LATAM, our JV will have the number one market position in South America. To support our best-in-class network, we continue to reshape our fleet and recently placed an order for 100 Boeing 737-10 aircraft. We're also expanding the power of our loyalty ecosystem with the recently announced Starbucks partnership, bringing two premier brands together. And this week, we announced a strategic partnership with an investment in Joby Aviation, aligning the industry's best airline with the innovation leader in developing eVTOL. Joby shares our vision of providing customers a premium experience. We're excited to help support Joby's long-term vision of faster, more reliable and more sustainable transit to the airport. In closing, while we are mindful of macroeconomic headwinds, the travel industry is experiencing a countercyclical recovery. Global demand is continuing to ramp as consumers shift spend to experiences, businesses return to travel and international markets continue to reopen. Demand has not come close to being quenched by a hectic summer travel season. At the same time, industry supply is constrained by aircraft availability, regional pilot shortages, and hiring and training needs. With record high fuel prices and increasing cost of capital, the hurdle rate is rising for incremental capacity across an industry that's still restoring its financial condition post-pandemic. Against this backdrop and coupled with meaningfully improved asset utilization, at Delta, we are uniquely positioned to grow our earnings and cash flow in 2023. At the same time, we will remain nimble and have the tools to manage through any changes in the overall environment. Over the last decade, Delta has structurally improved in significant ways, creating a trusted consumer brand built on a foundation as the most reliable airline globally driven by the very best professionals in the industry. And I truly believe that we are positioned to come through this period as a stronger airline than ever before. With that, let me hand it over to Glen, who can provide more details on our commercial performance. Glen Hauenstein : Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I want to first thank our employees for their hard work restoring our operations and delivering for our customers during a very busy summer travel season. Demand for travel on Delta remains strong. Investments in our products, airport service and the liability are reshaping customer perceptions and driving record satisfaction scores. Brand affinity supports our revenue premium to the industry, and we're making meaningful progress against our multiyear commercial strategy. September quarter results reflect momentum in premium products and loyalty, supporting continued diversification of our revenues. This quarter, a record 54% of our total revenue was generated by premium products and diverse revenue streams. We expect this to grow to 60% by 2024. September quarter revenues of $12.8 billion is a new quarterly record and 3% higher than 2019 on 17% less capacity. Hurricane Ian impacted revenues by approximately $70 million, with the impact evenly split between the third and fourth quarters. Total unit revenues finished 23.4% higher versus 2019, improving three points sequentially as international demand accelerated. Demand was strong throughout the quarter, with premium revenue growth outpacing main cabin by 10 points. Delta Premium Select is performing well ahead of our expectations as we expand the offering to more of our international network every day. We see continued runway ahead with the return of business travel, complementing strength in premium leisure. Our growing loyalty base drives high-margin revenue and supports continued growth in our valuable co-brand relationship with American Express. SkyMiles acquisitions are running 40% above 2019 with over 60% of our passenger revenues now generated by SkyMiles members. In the third quarter, record spend and strong acquisitions on our Amex co-brand cards resulted in $1.4 billion of Amex remuneration. This was 37% higher than 2019, and we now expect 2022 remuneration of $5.5 billion, further reinforcing our confidence in achieving our $7 billion target in 2024. Other revenue streams continue to perform well, with cargo revenue up 27% and MRO revenues up 4% versus '19. Business travel continues to improve. We expect corporate sales recovery in the December quarter in the low- to mid-80s at a system level. Importantly, less recovered sectors like banking, consulting and consumer services have all seen double-digit growth post Labor Day, helping bring New York largely in line with domestic system. We have growing confidence that while there will be changes, corporate travel will fully recover and increased workplace flexibility is creating new travel patterns. Our recent corporate survey validates our perspective with nearly 90% of accounts expecting near travel to stay the same or increase as we move into the fourth quarter. That optimism is also reflected in GBTA's recent travel survey where 80% of respondents expect travel volumes to increase in 2023 compared to '22. On the consumer side, domestic revenue remains well ahead of 2019, with international consumer revenue now fully restored. International is being led by the transatlantic where revenue was 12% higher than 2019 on 89% capacity restoration. Pacific was the most improved entity in the quarter and generated the highest unit revenue growth. We are encouraged by how the Pacific recovery is progressing, led by strong demand in our hub in Korea and to Australia. And we expect continued improvement as Japan reopens. Turning to the December quarter. Bookings for travel and spending on our co-brand cards continue to show healthy trends. We expect our revenue compared to 2019 will continue to improve in fourth quarter, up 5% to 9% on 8% to 9% less capacity. Demand for transatlantic travel is extending well into the fall. Starting in October, we anticipate flying more transatlantic capacity than 2019, making it the first geography to exceed 2019 capacity levels. And while European currencies are down versus the dollar, foreign yields are more than offsetting the foreign exchange impact, and U.S. demand is driving higher U.S. point of sale than 2019. October and November revenue is trending well. The December month will be impacted by an elongated period between the holidays and more return travel than usual pushed into January. Demand for the entire holiday period, however, is very robust. Fourth quarter unit revenues are expected to be up mid-teens versus 2019 as we continue to restore international capacity and increase domestic stage length. During the pandemic and through 2022, we set out a goal to improve our share in coastal gateways to become the leading global carrier in these important revenue centers, and I am proud of the team for successfully achieving this goal. Looking to 2023, we are shifting our focus to our core hubs, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Detroit and Salt Lake City, with approximately 75% of domestic seat growth dedicated to full restoration of our higher-margin core hubs. As our plan progresses, Delta will continue to prioritize our people and our customers, and extend our competitive advantages. In closing, we're coming into the final quarter of the year with a healthy demand backdrop, running the most reliable operation and exceeding our key commercial goals. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Dan to talk about the financials. Dan Janki : Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. The September quarter demonstrated progress on our financial priorities to drive margin improvement and reduce debt. We reported a $1.5 billion operating profit, and that's on a margin of 11.6%, our second consecutive quarter with a double-digit operating margin. That is on a network that's 17% smaller than 2019. Our non-unit fuel costs were 22.5% higher, in line with guidance, excluding the impact of the hurricane on capacity. The refinery generated profit of $192 million partially offsetting the impact of volatile crack spreads. Gross CapEx spend was $1.5 billion as we took delivery of 11 aircraft, including five A321neos, which are generating margins approximately 10 points higher than the aircraft they're replacing. CapEx was lower than our guidance, with fewer delivery -- with a few delivery delays, and we now expect CapEx spend of $5.7 billion for the full year. We ended the quarter with $20.5 billion of adjusted net debt. We repaid $1.8 billion of debt during the quarter as we continue to manage down our maturities over the next several years. This brings our debt repayment to over $4 billion year-to-date, reducing our run rate interest expense and reflecting our continued focus on returning to investment-grade metrics by 2024. For the December quarter, we expect earnings to be between $1 and $1.25 per share and an operating margin of 9% to 11%. Fuel prices remain volatile. With the most recent move up last week, we expect fourth quarter adjusted fuel price per gallon between $3.35 and $3.55. This includes $105 million contribution from the refinery equating to a $0.23 per gallon benefit. We expect the December quarter unit cost to be 12% to 13% higher than 2019. This is a 10-point improvement sequentially and shows clear progress as capacity restoration increases from the low 80% to low 90%. It's taken significant resources to rebuild the airline with industry-leading reliability. We are nearing the final stages with the workforce now in line with 2019. From here, we expect further benefit from scale as we reach full network restoration and better utilization of our fleet, our hubs and our workforce. The incremental cost to restore additional capacity is low as the resources are already in place, reducing unit costs. As Glen noted, much of our growth next year will be in our lowest cost core hubs through increased mainline aircraft utilization. Approximately 75% of our domestic seat growth in 2023 will be in our core hubs, including 45% from Atlanta alone. Further, between inefficiencies and rebuild expenses, we are carrying over $1 billion of excess costs in 2022. With the teams in place and the operations running reliable, we are seeing early improvements in efficiency. October metrics are pacing ahead of September, and we expect to return to historic levels as elevated training and the network normalized next summer. Achieving scale while restoring efficiency are Delta's largest CASM levers, these are within our control based on the pace of restoration and running an operation in line with Delta's standard of excellence. We know managing cost down is the best protection from economic uncertainty, and it is a company-wide priority. We are making progress restoring our financial foundation with significant profitability and positive cash flow this year. As we fully restore our network and unit costs improve, we expect another step-up in earnings next year, resulting in meaningful cash flow to further reduce our debt on path to our long-term targets. We are confident in delivering a competitive cost structure and our 2024 mid-teen margin target. In closing, I want to recognize the Delta entire global team for the operational improvements they delivered over the past few months. We are on track for meaningful and well-deserved employee profit-sharing payments, and I look forward to celebrating with our employees in February. Now with that, I'll turn it back to Julie for Q& A. Julie Stewart : Cody, can you please remind the analysts how to queue up for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Conor Cunningham : You touched on it a little bit in the prepared remarks, but the opportunity in Atlanta [Technical Difficulty]. Julie Stewart : Conor, you're cutting out. Can you please repeat your question? Conor Cunningham : Is this better? Julie Stewart : Try again. Conor Cunningham : Is that better? Julie Stewart : Yes. Conor Cunningham : Okay. Cool. You touched about the opportunity in Atlanta and the other core markets in 2023, and I think that's a really powerful trend for you guys. And I was just wondering if you could unpack it a little bit more, just -- I think you're really [Technical Difficulty] flow traffic. And you kind of -- your priority some other hub markets or other markets [Technical Difficulty] recovery. So could you just talk about the margin profile of flow traffic in general and just how you expect that to trend into next year? Glen Hauenstein : Right. Well, we set really two priorities during the pandemic that we wanted to come through that we thought would be important for the long-term strength of the franchise, and one was to improve our competitive positions in the coastal gateways. And we've certainly completed that as we exited the pandemic and get into a more normalized demand sets. So if you look at places like Los Angeles where we've now taken the number one position or Boston in terms of revenue, same in Boston, and we've strengthened our position in key markets like Seattle. So that was very important for us. The other thing to do was to not lose share in our core, and that was really the very tricky part. So we went in with a share in our core hubs of about 58% to 59% when you added them all up. And our goal is to exit at 60% or above, and we did that as well. So if you think about our core being approximately 20 points less restored than the coastal gateways, which are now fully restored or actually growing, maintain your core hub share or actually increase it, there was a lot of focus on that through the revenue management systems. So we choked off what I would say is more of our traditional flow in very key markets where Delta has historically been the leading carrier, particularly in the Southeast. And so as we head into -- and these customers or our customers are in our loyalty program. But in a lot of cases, they couldn't get fares that were competitive on Delta because we didn't have the seats to produce those. And really, as we head into 2023, our task that we've assigned our team is to get those historical high-yield flow customers back on Delta. And that's really our -- what our rebuild phase for 2023 is all about. Operator : We'll take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi Syth : I was - to achieve those kind of goals that you just talked about on the pilot side, could you detail a little bit more about what you're seeing in terms of training bottlenecks and pilot staffing on the mainline side as well as maybe attrition and staffing levels on the regional side? Ed Bastian : I could take it, Savi. We continue to make good progress in clearing those bottlenecks and getting our pilots into seats and categories every week. We're producing more and more pilots back to the operation. As we said in our remarks, our goal is to be in a position to have our network fully restored by the summer, and the pilots are obviously a big part of that. Savi Syth : But can you provide a little bit more color on the regional side given that's a little more unique as to what's happening there and not just about training throughput? Is some of the kind of the changes that you're seeing in the industry in terms of pilot rates and things like that, is that having an impact? What's Delta doing to make sure you're rebuilding those -- that capacity? Glen Hauenstein : Right. Well, clearly, the labor rates at the regional carriers have moved during the pandemic, and they're at significantly higher rates than they were pre-pandemic. I think long-term conventional wisdom is that will mean that the regional fleet in the long run are smaller. In the short run, we're wanting to get to a stabilization of demand for pilots, and we think that will occur sometime in '23. These new higher rates should keep more people in place. And so -- but we don't think it will be fully restored until probably '24, '25 at the earliest. And we're uniquely positioned there because we have the, of course, A220s, which we're delivering every month or so. And we've reactivated the 717s, which were actually not in our original plan for reactivation, but we've leaned on them pretty heavily to rebuild more quickly. And we think it's a better product. And now with the new labor rates, it's at lower unit cost as well as, yes, much lower unit cost than pre-pandemic. So I think we're uniquely positioned there with really the only major carrier that has these plethora of 100-seat airplanes. And we'll see what happens with the regionals in '23, but we think we're near the bottom in terms of pilot availability there. Ed Bastian : And one other thing I'd add is that we have the lowest regional jet footprint in the industry. We've been on a path, Savi, over the last decade to eliminate the 50-seat regional jet, and we're just about there. So we are out of that category. We do have 325 two-class regional jets, which we will continue to maintain going forward, but we are far less exposed than others to the -- some of this regional pilot shortage issue. Operator : We'll now move on to our next question from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Brandon Oglenski : Glen, I'm sure you've gotten this from a lot of investors. But obviously, folks are worried about a looming recession in the U.S. just driven by rates and inflation. And we're reminded of that again today. But obviously, your revenue guidance is pretty positive, but I do think it's a sequential decline in your yields. Can you talk to the components there? Because I know your long-haul flying is coming up as well. Just, if you're seeing any weakness or softness across your geographies. Glen Hauenstein : Yes. I think that's a great question, and I'm happy to explain it. Really, it's three main factors. One is international restoration continuing in 4Q as we -- as Pacific continues to open up, and we continue to increase our capacity in the Pacific that has downward pressure on RASM. Domestic stage is going up dramatically and at a different rate than some of our competitors and all of our competitors as we head into 4Q. That's really being driven by a lot of additional flying into Hawaii from the East Coast hubs that we didn't have pre-pandemic. And lastly, it's that period and the shift of the holiday return in December where December will be below trend, and January will be above trend. So those are the three main factors that are driving the sequential decline. And we're not seeing -- taking those out, we're not really seeing a decline at the market level. It's actually continuing to be quite strong, and we don't just see any impact yet. We're looking, of course, vigilant of looking for it, and we'll make adjustments as necessary if it does. But I think Ed was very clear earlier that we think that we have -- as an industry, very off trend in terms of our percent of GDP and just getting back to that represents a huge upside to the industry. Brandon Oglenski : And I guess related to that, can you talk about business travel recovery in the quarter and what you're seeing right now in the fourth quarter? Glen Hauenstein : Yes. I think we outlined at earlier conferences that we've seen about a 10-point improvement between 3Q and 4Q, and we see that continuing through 4Q. So, we're now in the low to mid-80s in terms of revenue, with traffic being about 10 points below that. And that's what we see as we head into the end of the year. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Michael Linenberg : Ed, I want to go back to the comment that you made in your opening comments. You said something about $20 billion to $30 billion on the table relative to GDP. Can you shed some light on that? And are you assuming that we get back to that historical relationship? Or are you building in some cushion there, if you could elaborate? Ed Bastian : Sure, Mike. That's an industry number, as you can appreciate. And that gets you closer to the historical relationship. We've seen over many, many years, it's a very sticky relationship. We saw it fall a bit after 9/11, and we saw it bounce back. We saw it fall during the recession. We've seen it bounce back. And we certainly saw it the biggest fall ever coming back from the pandemic. So one of the things that we're seeing is such outsized demand for our product across the board. And when you couple that as well with the industry constraints that we also talked about, that is also keeping the pricing strong at the same time. So whether we get back to the full $20 billion or $30 billion, I don't know, but I think we're gaining on it as we go. Michael Linenberg : Okay. Great. And then just a quick one, Glen, on the percentage of your total revenue that ties to a premium and diverse revenue streams. I think we're at 54% now, but the goal is to get to 60% by 2024. That seems somewhat conservative, but maybe you're envisioning just a much bigger pie as other segments recover like Asia Pacific, and that's probably why it's taking that much longer. Am I thinking about that correctly? Or is there something else going into that? Glen Hauenstein : I think we're very, very confident in getting to 60% given that we've been less restored internationally, and internationally has actually a higher component of premium revenues and as well as the new fleets coming in and the continuation of growth at American Express and [indiscernible]. I think the one that we're not confident with right now is cargo for 2024. We've seen some lowering yields, but that's being more than offset by the international restoration. So I don't see that continuing to grow at double digits as we head into '24. But I think 60%, as you pointed out, was our aspirational target. As we get closer and closer to it, it looks like it's -- we may need to increase that as we get closer to '24. Operator : We'll now move on to our next question from David Vernon with Bernstein. David Vernon : So Dan, you mentioned the cost of adding incremental capacity right now is very low as we get through to '23. '24. Can you talk about how low that is relative to the average? And then maybe as a follow-on, Ed or Glen, can you talk to the topic of maintaining capacity discipline, right? Obviously, if there's a way to unlock cost, you want to unlock the cost, but you also don't necessarily want to flood the market. How would you suggest we kind of sue the investor concerns about that tension between adding capacity to lower cost versus potentially adding too much capacity and tipping over the fair cart? Dan Janki : Okay. First, on the cost opportunity and the incremental costs associated with it. When you think about where we are this year in '22, we're 18 points higher on a unit cost basis versus '19. And in there, there's over nine points related to scale and the ability to put scale in going from 85% restored to being fully restored. That would go in at low incremental CASM in the $0.03 to $0.04 range. And then there's another five points related to -- I talked about over $1 billion related to the rebuild and inefficiencies. About half -- almost half of that is rebuilt. And when you think about that bucket, half of that is just the hiring and training intensity that we're under. And that will, as Ed talked about, as we put people back in production that will sunset. And then the other piece is split between elevated over time as we've protected the operation and also the reactivation of the fleet from that product that isn't normal run rate maintenance. So that's really where you get the 14 points of opportunity of the 18, but the incremental piece is at nine points, which is very attractive incremental growth at low CASM. Glen Hauenstein : On capacity, we are just going to continue to monitor it as we move forward. And each one -- each market is different. And when we look at it not at an aggregate level, but at a market level to ensure that our margins stay where we need them to be. And so I think that's our -- has been our approach historically. It's worked quite well. And our approach moving forward is that it's a ctually a very granular thing. And what we've seen is demand has come back very different in 2022 than it left in 2019, although the aggregates are now above where we were in '19, where people are flying and why they're flying is very different. And so that's where we're going to continue to focus on, seeing opportunities and capitalizing them in '23 as we move forward with our rebuilt. Ed Bastian : And David, if I could add to Glen's comments, as you also appreciate, we've been, by far, the most cautious about building back our network given that we wanted to make certain we're doing it reliably, and we're doing it with our customers and our people in mind, first and foremost. And so a good chunk of the restoration is solely that, just getting back up to our normalized industry share our full capacity and utilization of the airline. There are a lot more governors in this environment on the capacity than ever before, whether it's high-fuel prices, high-cost capital, difficulty getting pilot staffed, typically OEMs producing aircraft. So I think with respect to investor questions around overall capacity levels, I feel very comfortable with what we're doing here at Delta. David Vernon : So is it fair to say that profitability is more important than achieving some unit costs and market share goal? Ed Bastian : Of course, it's always about profitability and margins. And that's why I said in my remarks, I think we are uniquely positioned to do both, to grow where we haven't had the opportunity to grow as quickly as others have grown with strong demand supporting that, coupled with a significant unit cost benefit as we move forward because we already own all the assets and we already have the full staffing numbers pretty much on property. Operator : We'll take our next question from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Maybe I wanted to ask a big picture question, Ed. Industry unit revenues are up fairly substantially over the long-term trend due to a number of factors you guys have talked about. I know you don't want to comment on forward pricing trends for you, but broadly about the industry. Do you think that through the pandemic, with the growth of expansion of premium, growth of loyalty products and other shifts, do you think that there's a structural shift in the way airlines think about pricing and the consumer takes that price? Glen Hauenstein : Yes. I don't -- we don't ever comment on forward pricing. And I think what you've seen is that the industry has done a good job historically now in recovering the higher cost in both fuel and nonfuel. And I don't see anything that would indicate that, that's not going to be the case moving forward. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Okay. Then maybe just a quick follow-up. Can you just talk about the strength of the dollar versus other currencies and then how that's potentially affecting international demand at all? Glen Hauenstein : Absolutely, great question. As we know, the dollar is at historic highs right now. And normally, we would see that impacting our offshore point of sale in terms of realized fares. But given the demand and supply balance that's existing right now in all of the international marketplaces that we serve, we see that not materializing. The fare increases have more than offset the lower currency rates. And indeed, the onshore tracking as a percent of 2019 is roughly in sync with offshore revenue, so really good balance. And what we've also seen is given the strength of the dollar, that outbound travel has more than offset a bit of weakness in terms of the outbound travel from the foreign point of sale. So all in all, that's been a very positive mix for us. At a service level, you might look at it and say that could be trouble. But for us, it's not been trouble as Delta. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : So on the Amex side, $5.5 billion, you're talking about going to $7.5 billion by $24 million. How do you think about '23? Is it linear? How does the downturn in consumer spending impact that trajectory? Glen Hauenstein : I'd say given where we sit right now, we are very confident in the $5.5 billion, and we have some rate adjustments that occur in '23 that give you a good way to the $7 billion, and then the continued acquisitions. I think we're -- we have some cushion in there right now. And it's not a stretch objective to get to $7 billion in '24 as we sit today. And so there's a little cushion in there should we see revenues plateau. Well, having said that, we have not seen card spend plateau. And although we have a record number of accounts in force, we're also seeing record spend on individual cards right up until today. So I mean this is really current numbers that we're looking at. And so while we're mindful that, that may trend down a little bit, I think we've got some cushion in there given the strong acquisition and, if any, the brand. Scott Group : Okay. And then with all the talk about the excess cost in the network right now and restoring the network, what's your degree of confidence that CASM could be down year-over-year, '23 versus '22, and you can maintain sort of double-digit margin even if pricing starts to moderate? Dan Janki : Yes. It goes back to a little bit what I talked about earlier. When you think about sequentially year-over-year, we're up 18 points. So our confidence is as high as it relates to the 14 points that I talked about in an opportunity for clear improvement because of the capacity going in, 15 points alone drives over nine points of that. The other one I gave you a lot of color on it is regarding the rebuilt cost, and those will certainly sunset and dissipate as we complete the rebuild. And then I think the last one is the efficiency, which is the other half of that five-point, and we'll get that over time. That's about the proficient -- the workforce and our resources getting more effective It certainly is helped by the operational reliability that is foundational to that as that happens. And we see that the workforce will get the hours more aligned to the operations. And the underlying processes and efficiencies will come through. Ed Bastian : And Scott, if I could wrap that, is that when you think about next year, obviously, we're going to be bringing a fair bit of capacity into the domestic system. That's going to help with what Glen mentioned earlier, a lot of our customers are priced out of our products. And so, we're going to be bringing more affordability, opening us up to additional buckets of demand. Yet at the same time, the incremental marginal cost of delivering that supply is substantially lower than any modest price adjustments we would see. Operator : We'll now move on to our next question from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Andrew Didora : Glen, when I look at kind of your domestic passenger revenues, 3Q, they were up two. And 2Q, they were up three. What do you think it takes to get the domestic network growth accelerating? Is it just the capacity adds in your core hubs that you spoke of earlier on? Or should we just think about the opening up of international markets being the main driver of the revenue recovery over the next few quarters? Glen Hauenstein : I think it's both, right, is that -- and pretty evenly distributed. We have first time forever we're actually now bigger in the transatlantic in the month of October than we were in October of '19 and with very successful unit revenues and improved profitability there. So I think as we head through the winter, it's international growth. We have LATAM now really starting to come online in earnest. And then the Japan opening in -- right now is a very exciting thing for us being a historically very large carrier in Japan. So, if the international marketplaces are open and open without restrictions, we see robust demand, and we see that continuing to be our backdrop. We see -- we have good visibility now to the winter in Europe because the APs are a little bit longer in Europe. And so, now we're thinking about the spring. And I can't imagine that as we get to spring and summer of next year that we don't see another robust demand because we did miss three years of demand for the leisure travel to Europe. So people run out of time, myself included, and I think, gosh, how many years do I have left to do that? And so I think we have a really good backdrop there. And then domestically, these are customers that we know want to fly Delta. These are in our core regional markets that we just weren't able to produce capacity at attractive inventory levels that they would want to purchase on Delta. And as we bring those down, as Ed mentioned earlier, as we bring those relative fair premiums down, as we open up the hubs, we think that's going to be some relatively easy lifting for us. Andrew Didora : Got it. That's helpful. And just wanted to follow up from an earlier question as regard to the improved training pipeline that Ed mentioned earlier, look, you've been very consistent about carefully building back the network by next summer. But if you wanted to, would you have enough pilot availability and enough labor to accelerate that network restoration? Not saying that you will, but I'm just trying to get a sense of where you stand just in terms of the pipeline the training backlog. Ed Bastian : You can expect our network rebuild to be disciplined. It's going to steadily grow. But we're not going to fall in the trap we were last spring where we pushed ourselves too hard. So we learned from that. We're not going to accelerate it faster, and we're ready to deliver. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Jamie Baker : Glen, you commented a couple of times on corporate recovering, but looking different. Hoping you can expand on that, but also include leisure. And just a couple of examples, looking at JPMorgan employee patterns, Friday meetings are increasingly difficult to get. So most of our employees are coming back Thursday night instead, I'm seeing people leave earlier for Thanksgiving since they know they can work on the road. I'm just looking for more examples of these type of shifts and, more importantly, whether revenue management and scheduling have to evolve to take advantage of it. Glen Hauenstein : I think they already have. And I think, as I mentioned earlier, that the demand sets are very different than they were in 2019 in terms of places people are going, in terms of times that they're going. And we're making those adjustments. I think one of the more interesting things, as you mentioned, Monday -- Sunday night outbound, Monday morning outbound used to be the peak. That's now bleeding into Tuesday, out Tuesday, back Thursday, so some shorter trips midweek. It's bleeding into people, taking -- mixing business and leisure. So I know myself, I went to Paris last week for meetings, and I spent the weekend for leisure and before I probably would have just come back. So I think we see that. We see in the holidays with people not having to necessarily be in the office as regularly as they did before the pandemic, and we see people stretching out the holiday. So Sunday night, Monday morning -- Sunday night returns or the Sunday after Thanksgiving was historically the highest revenue day we had in our network. That's now a little bit lighter, and we see that travel moving into Monday and Tuesday returns. So yes -- and we've been making those adjustments along the way, and I think pretty successfully. And I think it's pretty exciting, right, that it's coming -- in aggregate, it's coming back differently, but it's coming back even stronger. Jamie Baker : Okay. And quickly for Ed. So Mark and I have been doing quite a bit of work on LATAM. You referenced it before now that the JBA is in place. Can you update us on the partnership? I mean how have your forecast changed because of their restructuring as well as the industry dynamic in South America? How should we think about the contribution of Delta going forward? Just an update there would be appreciated. Ed Bastian : Sure. A couple of things that have changed. One, as you know, they've also worked through the very difficult restructuring. And they're still not out of the court process, though they expect to be out sometime next month. So, we're anxious to see them out, and that's going to provide them some additional opportunities to start to grow and really take advantage of the powerhouse they've become as well as the substantial reduction in cost as well as balance sheet -- reductions on debt that they've been able to achieve through the bankruptcy process. We just got the ATI from DOT, and we're excited about that. So we haven't really been able to talk in three years to them at a detailed level about the JV itself, though those meetings are beginning literally as we speak. And it's a little bit of a delayed response, but there's nothing in there that we laid out three years ago when we announced the investment in LATAM that I'm any less excited for. I think if anything, we're going to have an accelerated impact there. The competitive balance in South America is less intense. There's a lot of local airlines got hit by the pandemic pretty hard. And you look at them, you look at what we're doing with Aeromexico in the same time, we see a lot of growth potential for Delta as well as the JV. Operator : We'll then move on to our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Most of my questions have been asked. But maybe one for Glen on seasonality and sort of getting back to normal seasonality, which some other carriers have referred to, can you just talk about which regions, if any, are sort of back to normal and maybe contrast domestic with some of the international regions, which are probably outperforming sequentially? Glen Hauenstein : I'd say there's a new normal on all of this. And while we do start to see seasonality patterns reemerging that we're not as present in the early stages of the rebuild, they're not as acute maybe as they were pre-pandemic. So we had a fantastic September to Florida, absent of the hurricane, which you wouldn't have thought. If you look at September, which is historically one of the worst months for Florida, you couldn't buy a ticket to Disney. We had some people who were on break here, and they said they wanted to go to Disney with their families, and they couldn't buy a ticket. It's closed out. And so I think we've seen this shift. And as airfares have increased and as hotels have increased and the whole -- people are also moving to the shoulders a little bit more because they can take advantage of the fact that on the margin, it's a little bit less expensive, and they have more flexibility with their work that they don't necessarily need to be in the office on those days. So I think yes, there are definitely things that are reappearing in terms of more traditional seasonality. But I think also, there are a lot of things that are offsetting that muting it and making it a little bit less pronounced as it was pre-pandemic. Duane Pfennigwerth : That's helpful. And then maybe just one for Dan. Just given the move in rates, any high-level thoughts on pension gains versus interest expense? And any particular pieces of debt that you'll need to roll in 2023 and how we should be thinking about that? Dan Janki : Yes, certainly. As it relates to the debt stack, 17% of our debt is variable, and the size of that relative to our cash position, our cash position to outsize. So as you have increasing rates, actually, interest income will outpace interest expense meaningful through that period of time. On the pension, you have both the -- when you think about it, rates reduce your liability, change your interest expense. Those are fairly neutral as you're going forward, certainly change in your asset returns versus your expected performance. And given how debt and -- the debt markets and equity markets have moved, we've underperformed the expected target rate. So you smooth those into earnings over a 20-year period, and then you earn off a lower rate. So that would create a headwind. As you think about going forward, we'll talk more about that in December. We had that stepping down somewhat, but not to the degree that it will. But interest expense is ahead. As we've been ahead on, on managing down our debt levels and ahead on that, our interest expense is coming in better, and our interest income will be better, which will be a partial offset to that. Operator : We'll then move on to our next question from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker : I just wanted to confirm something that I heard you say about the holiday season being extended and that kind of pushing some demand into January. Can you unpack that a little bit and kind of talk about how much that impacted your 4Q comps versus 2019? And also, did you see something similar over the summer into the fall where do you think that some people who may have been priced at of traveling over the summer are now traveling in the fall? Glen Hauenstein : No. I think it's mostly the fact -- just a calendar shift of where the returns are. And so, I think that's -- and we think it's about two points of sequential decline from -- in our 23.5 to 17, about two points of that is a shift of some of the returns of the holiday into January. Julie Stewart : We'll now go to our final analyst question. Operator : We'll take our final question from Helane Becker with Cowen. Helane Becker : Appreciate the time. So team, here's my question. As you think about the shift in mix that you've been talking about, not just this quarter, but most of the year, how should we think about the importance of loyalty? You've talked about the increase in SkyMile cards and the spend you're seeing. But I have to think that loyalty is shifting kind of away from that business traveler to the leisure traveler. So how should we think about that going forward? Glen Hauenstein : Well, Helane, I think at a macro level is that whatever your purpose was, the redemptions that carried at the end, was always for the leisure travel. And so as people continue to see our brand evolving and want to become involved with it, whether or not it's for business or for leisure, we've seen the opportunity to continue to grow the program itself at record pace, which is very exciting and, I think, a real testament to the brand strength and all the hard work that delta people put out every day. And now it's our job to take that brand strength and turn it into profitability. And of course, we do that through using those as prospects for our American Express card, but we're also increasingly making our ecosystem broader. And I think just yesterday, we had a very claiming announcement about partnering with Starbucks and linking our programs together. And I think creating an exciting dynamic ecosystem that is the cornerstone of our loyalty program, which is, of course, based on the fantastic airline that Delta runs every day, is really the base of it. But we are very excited about where we can take this over the next five years in terms of expanding that loyalty platform to be more than just Delta as an airline. Julie Stewart : All right. With that, we'll wrap up the analyst portion of the call. I'll now turn it over to Trebor Banstetter, our Managing Director of Enterprise and Leader Communications, to start the media questions. Trebor Banstetter : Thank you, Julie. Cody, as we transition to the media Q&A, please remind all the reporters on the call the process for joining the queue. We're going to try to get to as many questions as we can in our remaining time. Operator : Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Please go ahead. Mary Schlangenstein : I wanted to first get a quick clarification. When you were talking about the regional capacity being constrained -- continuing to be constrained, and thus, your capacity being constrained by the pilot shortage, I thought I understood you to say you don't expect the full restoration at the regional level until '24, '25 at the earliest. I wanted to make sure I was hearing that correctly and whether you're talking about just Delta or if you're talking about the industry there. Glen Hauenstein : Well, I can't speak to the industry. I can speak for Delta. And yes, you've got it right, '24 to '25 is when we think we'll have the utilization back to historic levels on all the equipment we have contracted. Mary Schlangenstein : Okay. And my second question was in terms of -- during the pandemic where you had a lot of leisure travelers who were flying, opting to buy up into premium seats because a lot of them were empty, are you still seeing that same thing? Are you seeing a lot of them buying up? Or do you -- have you seen that pull back now and not happening quite so much? Glen Hauenstein : It's strengthening as we get -- come out of the pandemic. So we're very excited. And I think we highlighted in the call that our recovery is being led by premium products. And premium products -- restoration is 10 points ahead, coach of main cabin and basic economy. So very excited about people getting used to this, people enjoying it and intend to repurchase is over 70%. So you see the customers coming back for more of this as well. Mary Schlangenstein : And have you dropped the number of basic economy fares that you offer per flight or even total? Glen Hauenstein : That fluctuates every day based on demand and supply. So in general, it's been trending lower, but that could reverse itself today or tomorrow. So, it's not something we actively manage. It's kind of a daily occurrence. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from David Slotnick with TPG. David Slotnick : I'm wondering just with the growth in co-brand spend and card acquisitions and everything, are you seeing more numbers just year-over-year and year over '19 meeting medallion status or meeting the higher levels of status? Glen Hauenstein : Absolutely. And we want to continue to evolve our program today. It's premium for our most premium customers. And as you all know, we announced some changes for the '24 program earlier this month, which was really designed to ensure that we had the correct people. We were the most generous, as you know, also during the pandemic in extending benefit. So we actually have seen an incredible increase in the number of our most premium customers. And -- but our intent is to make sure that everybody who is a premium customer has a really premium experience. So, we've got to balance that off. David Slotnick : And then just considering the capacity cuts this summer and then the capacity discipline that we've seen going forward, I'm wondering if you have any thoughts on just outlook for the holiday season, what we're going to see in terms of operational reliability? Ed Bastian : We will deliver the type of experience for our customers that they expect, which will be continuing to run just a very, very strong operation. One of the things that Glen talked about earlier is the shift of travel within the holiday period itself. And I think you're going to see a more normalized flow than you would typically do. Holidays tend to be very peaky on the highest days and lighter on some of the less -- lower travel days. And with travelers having a lot more flexibility and mobility relative to work, I think you're going to see a busy period for the Thanksgiving week throughout the week. And that's going to help us operationally a bit as well, managing flow. And I think you'll also see that over the Christmas, New Year break as well. Operator : We'll take your next question from Alison Sider with The Wall Street Journal. Alison Sider : I guess just kind of thinking about the economy broadly. Just curious, from your vantage point, where do we think the economy is? Like are we headed towards recession? But it -- maybe you want where travel is more resilient than it's been in the past? Are we not? I guess just -- you guys have a pretty -- big picture view from where you sit, so just curious for your thoughts. Ed Bastian : We mentioned in our remarks that -- and I really do believe it. So the airline industry, not just Delta, is in a countercyclical recovery because we're still building back from where we were. And so the amount of supply that's in the market probably has already taken into account somewhat of any recessionary risks. We're not operating at Delta anywhere close to what we used to operate in the past, and that's why the demand of our product and the pricing for the product has been so strong. Our crystal ball is good for 90 to 120 days. After that, it gets a little murky. Our advanced bookings don't go out too much further than that in large numbers. But from what we can see and what our big corporates are telling us is that the travel sector of the economy is going to be very strong through the quarter and into the new year. So that's the best we can. I can't speak for the broader economy. I know there's some pretty significant macro shifts going on in spending out of goods and into services, which we are beneficiary of. Of course, we contributed the last two years to the other side of that, and we're glad to see people back on the road. Alison Sider : And then if I could ask one more. Just curious how you're thinking about share repurchases like you can sort of see that becoming a political issue already. I'm just curious how much sort of the pushback we've already seen from certain lawmakers and labor groups, how much that factors into your thinking about that? Ed Bastian : Our sole priority at Delta is to make sure that any excess cash that we're generating is used to pay down debt. And we acquired a meaningful amount of debt during the pandemic. And we want to get our investment-grade rating back, as we've talked. So over the next couple of years, that will be our -- and beyond, by the way, not just the next couple of years, that will still be the top priority for any excess cash. And of course, we'll also be using our cash to continue to invest in the business and invest in our people. So that's where the cash is going. I don't see any share repurchases happening here at Delta for the foreseeable future. Operator : We'll take our next question from Leslie Josephs of CNBC. Leslie Josephs : Delta has been putting in a lot of effort to position itself for a premium airline, and there's a lot of buyout into the premium cabins. Longer term, do you see a need for basic economy anymore? And then just second question, how much bigger would the airline be if it did have -- was it up-to-date in pilot training, hiring? And how many aircraft it had? Glen Hauenstein : Basic economy is not a hard cabin. It's an availability of a fare, and we want to keep that in place. It's a very effective tool. We haven't used it as much historically because we've been so full. But as we get to a more normalized environment, there probably will be more basic economy in -- available in '23 than there were in '24. And we created that because the way that the ultra-low-cost carriers price their products where they don't show you all of the add-ons, they show you a very low intro fare and then add on everything from carry-ons to a soda. And so, we wanted to have a relatively de-counted product, although it's still far superior to the product that you buy on the ULCCs. It doesn't have all the products and the upgradability that the higher fare structures do. And it's a very effective competitive tool. But as I mentioned earlier, it's -- the fare structures are there, and they're either available because there -- we're not selling out on airplanes or they're not. And so that's the way we've created it, and it's not a cabinet in and of itself where the premium products are actually hard cabins. They're Comfort+ or Delta Premium Select or Delta One, which actually have physical attributes as well as the other components, so... Ed Bastian : And Leslie, on your second question, this summer, we operated roughly 15% below where we were in the summer of '19. And we said our goal is for next summer to close that gap and have our network fully restored. So I think that's a ballpark number of 15%. That doesn't mean we're going to have 15% more people or 15% more planes. It's really just utilizing the people we already have because we're already at pretty close to 2019 staffing levels. And the fleet we have has taken a pretty significant utilization hit as we've reduced supplying and bringing it back. So, it's really using the assets and the people we already have more efficiently. That's going to generate a meaningful amount of that growth. Leslie Josephs : Okay. And have the passengers used most of their vouchers and credit that they got during the pandemic? Or are they still sitting on a lot of those? If you have any detail on how much or how many -- what the value is. Glen Hauenstein : We don't release any details, but there's still -- there's -- we have very long-dated expiration on that. So nothing is going to expire until the end of '24. And there's still a sizable number of credits out there. Operator : We'll take our next question from Edward Russell with Skift. Edward Russell : I want to ask what Delta's plan is if the Congress does not extend the waiver for the 737 MAX 10 cockpits that expires at the end of the year? Ed Bastian : We -- I was asked this question on CNBC this morning, and I said there is a plan B. And of course, when we made the decision to buy the 10, we had a lot of conversations with Boeing around that specific question because it's a big part of our capacity, and we want to make certain that we're not going to be left without an alternative. So, we do have a plan B. We're not discussing what that plan B is, but there is a plan B with Boeing in the event it doesn't get certified. That said, we remain optimistic it will be certified. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Dawn Gilbertson with Wall Street General. Dawn Gilbertson : Ed, I wanted to ask you about the DOT's latest proposal on fee transparency. You guys and other airlines blasted it in 2014. What is your take on this latest proposal? I know you haven't filed a formal comment yet. And secondly, what do you think the chances are of this going through? Peter Carter : It's Peter Carter. What I would say in response to the proposal is we think that customers do have access to fee and pricing information. Today, on the Internet, we think our pricing is transparent. We will be providing formal comment to the DOT because one of the challenges with the rule as proposed is the way they're viewing transparency, they're expecting a carrier to provide a moment of making the search every single potential fee or price without regard to who's actually searching. So it may be a fee that's not relevant to the consumer, which, of course, could create quite a bit of confusion for consumers. So, we'll be providing that input to the DOT, and we hope that they obviously see that rule as something that's unnecessary to impose. Ed Bastian : Thank you, Dawn. And we have time for one final question. Operator : We'll hear next from Kelly Yamanouchi with the Atlanta Journal Constitution. Kelly, your line is open. Kelly, we're not able to hear you. Please check your line mute function. All right. Hearing no response. Ed Bastian : All right, Cody, we'll follow up with Kelly later, but I think that is going to conclude our call. So thanks, everybody, for listening and participating. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude today's conference. We do thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Matthew, and I will be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Julie Stewart : Thank you, Matthew, and good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us for our December quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. Joining us from Atlanta today, our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; our CFO, Dan Janki. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta\u2019s performance and strategy, Glen will provide an update on the revenue environment and Dan will discuss costs in our balance sheet. After the prepared remarks, we will take analyst questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up, so we can get to as many as possible. After the analyst Q&A, we will move to our media questions. Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta\u2019s SEC filings. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I will turn the call over to Ed. Ed Bastian : Thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Earlier Delta reported our full year results including our December quarter earnings per share of $1.48 on record revenue that was 8% above 2019 levels. We generated a 12% operating margin, our third consecutive quarter of double-digit operating margins pointing to the strength of our recovery. I want to sincerely thank the 90,000 strong Delta team for their outstanding work in delivering these results and serving our customers during a very busy holiday travel season. In my opinion, 2022 was the most difficult operational year in our history and was capped off by severe winter storms over the holidays. I am grateful to our employees for their great work to recover the operation, while keeping our customers and each other safe. They are the reason our brand and customer loyalty is at the top of the industry. Our December quarter earnings per share and margins exceeded guidance, marking a strong close to a year where we made significant progress regarding restoration of our financial foundation. For the full year, we reported earnings of $3.20 per share on $46 billion of revenue. We delivered pre-tax income of $2.7 billion, an improvement of more than $6 billion over 2021. Delta\u2019s profitability led the industry and in our nearly 100-year history, 2022 was our seventh highest result even with a $1 billion loss in the first quarter. We are pleased to report positive free cash flow for the year, which funded $6 billion of capital invested back into the business and we repaid close to $5 billion in gross debt. Sharing our success is a longstanding pillar of Delta\u2019s culture and I am proud to announce that we will be paying our employees $550 million in well-earned profit sharing coming Valentine\u2019s Day. 2022 came in ahead of our plan on revenue, earnings and cash flow, demonstrating strong execution in the first year of the three-year plan we laid out at the 2021 Capital Markets Day. I am incredibly proud of the team for rebuilding the world\u2019s best performing airline, and importantly, we are not just building back, we are continuing to improve and extend our competitive advantages. Delta\u2019s brand continued to strengthen in 2022, with record performance from our loyalty and co-brand card programs, and customer satisfaction scores consistently perform above pre-pandemic levels. Through the year, we have hired and trained 25,000 new employees, now representing over a quarter of the total company. Our team showed their operating talent and resilience as we retained our number one position in completion factor and on time arrivals amongst our peer set, despite having so many new team members. The Delta brand is centered on our safe, reliable and exceptional service, and our operational excellence was recognized by Cirium last week, which named us yet again the most on time airline in North America. We fortified our international partnerships in 2022, position -- positioning us for profitable international growth in the years ahead. As detailed last month, expanding our international margins to domestic levels is an important opportunity for Delta in the years to come. We have invested in the customer experience at every stage of the travel journey, from the continued refresh of our fleet with next-generation far more fuel efficient aircraft to generational airport rebuilds and technology investments that are providing our employees better tools and our customers a more seamless experience. And we continue to attract and partner with leading brands to grow our SkyMiles ecosystem and further enable customers to use their SkyMiles during travel and beyond. Heading into 2023, our momentum continues. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas just last week, we unveiled the next phase in our vision to connect the Sky. Starting February 1st, Delta will be the first major U.S. airline to provide fast, free, unlimited WiFi to all through its free SkyMiles account. This will be available on nearly 80% of our U.S. system to start and growing every week. By the end of next year, we expect to deliver this service seamlessly throughout the rest of our international and regional fleets. And we debuted Delta Sync, which will create personalized experiences and engagement opportunities on the free WiFi portal. We are partnering with great brands like T-Mobile and Paramount+, as well as building on our longstanding relationship with American Express to bring to life our vision of a more connected and personalized travel experience. As a trusted consumer brand, Delta continues to differentiate the premium flying experience, building loyalty and supporting our ambition to transcend the industry. Moving to our outlook, at our Investor event last month, we provided full year 2023 guidance for revenue growth of 15% to 20% year-over-year, earnings of $5 per share to $6 per share and free cash flow of over $2 billion. We are affirming that guidance today and introducing our March quarter outlook, which Glen and Dan will provide in detail. For the March quarter, we expect to deliver a 4% to 6% operating margin and improve our pre-tax income by more than $1 billion compared to the same period last year. Importantly, we are embedding the assumed impact of all labor cost increases throughout our guidance metrics. We are pleased to have reached an agreement in principle with our pilots, but out of respect for the process, we will not be discussing the details of the agreement on today\u2019s call. As I outlined last month, I have never seen a more constructive backdrop for the industry. Demand remains strong as passengers return to the skies and industry returns to the long-term trend to GDP, all while supply constraints continue. I believe our industry will see tens of billions of dollars of incremental demand in the next few years coming out of the pandemic. As the industry leader with a proven strategy and strong execution track record, Delta is well positioned to build on our momentum in the New Year. We are confident in our ability to deliver significant improvement in earnings and free cash flow in 2023, consistent with the plan we laid out last month and we are on track to deliver our 2024 targets of more than $7 of earnings per share and $4 billion of free cash flow. As always, we remain mindful of the macroeconomic trends and have demonstrated that we have the tools to effectively manage a changing economic climate. In closing, Delta delivered in 2022, outperforming our plan and leading the industry operationally and financially. We are uniquely positioned to grow earnings and cash flow in 2023, 2024 and beyond. The power of our premium brand continues to grow, and with the very best people in the industry, I couldn\u2019t be more excited about what\u2019s ahead for Delta and our customers. Thank you again. With that, I will turn it over to Glen. Glen Hauenstein : Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I couldn\u2019t be prouder of what the Delta people accomplished throughout 2022 and I want to congratulate our teams on their much deserved profit sharing payout they will be receiving next month. For the full year, we generated revenue of $46 billion, a $19 billion improvement year-over-year. We delivered record December quarter and full year unit revenues, sustaining our revenue premium to the industry of more than 110%. For the 12th consecutive year, Delta was named the number one corporate airline in Business Travel News survey, as we continue to invest in our network and product offerings. And through the year, we made significant progress on our long-term commercial strategy to deepen our network advantages, expand premium revenues, grow our loyalty ecosystem and further diversify our revenues. Starting with our network strategy, we focused on solidifying our positions in coastal gateways, while protecting our core hub shares. We secured the leading positions in both Boston and Los Angeles, while increasing local market share in our core hubs. Premium let all year with paid load factors higher than 2019 and yield growth outpacing Main Cabin, while basic economy made up less than 5% of revenue, half of the 2019 levels. We expanded our Delta Premium Select rollout during the year. Customer response has been positive and the cabin performed better than our initial expectations. Our rollout continues in 2023 and we will have this product on 84% of our international wide-body fleet by this summer. Our loyalty program continued to exceed our expectations with record SkyMiles acquisitions in 2022, 42% higher than 2019. As Ed noted, we are partnering with leading companies to expand our loyalty ecosystem, increasing the value of our program for customers and deepening customer engagement with Delta. With an expanding ecosystem and free, fast WiFi, we expect continued growth in our loyalty base. Our partnership with American Express delivered record results, with full year remuneration of $5.5 billion, ahead of our initial target and positioning us to deliver over $6.5 billion in 2023 and over $7 billion in 2024. Cargo revenue was a record in 2022 and we expect to grow cargo revenues in 2023, as increased capacity offsets the cargo yield environment. With strong execution across our business lines, a record 55% of revenue was generated by premium products and diverse revenue streams. We are confident in our path to exceed 60% by 2024. While not without challenges, 2022 was a strong year for Delta and we exited the year with momentum. During the December quarter, we generated revenue of $12.3 billion, 8% higher than 2019 on 9% less capacity. We saw revenue recapture at the end of December that offset the impact of weather disruptions in our system around Christmas. Fourth quarter unit revenues were 19% higher than 2019, with strength driven by consumer demand throughout the quarter. Corporate travel demand was steady through the quarter, with corporate domestic sales 80% recovered to 2019 levels. We expect March quarter revenue to be up 14% to 17% higher versus 2019. On capacity approaching full restoration, we expect March quarter unit revenues will be up 15% to 17% compared to 2019, including a 2-point impact from higher stage. Based on how we are deploying our network, our stage length is expected to be up 5 points compared to 2019, resulting in a higher restoration of ASMs and seats. This is a temporary dynamic that is unique to Delta among major carriers. Stage will begin to normalize relative to 2019 and relative to the industry as we rebuild our core hubs later this year. For 2023, we expect to grow revenue 15% to 20% year-over-year as we fully restore our network and further diversify our revenue streams. Consumer demand remains healthy, with advanced bookings significantly ahead on both yield and load factor for each month of the March quarter compared to 2019. And in our recent corporate survey, results were positive with 96% of respondents expecting to travel as much or more in 1Q than 4Q led by financial services. In the New Year, bookings reflect the survey optimism and are accelerating. International revenue continues to be led by the transatlantic. We are seeing robust demand across our expanded footprint in Europe and expect the spring and summer to set new record revenues. Latin America is performing very well, led by Mexico, the Caribbean and Central America, with a recovery in Deep South America now accelerating. And we are pleased with the early results from the launch of the LATAM JV and I am excited about the opportunities for us in 2023 and beyond. In the Pacific, we expected record first quarter profits in both Australia and Korea as our multiyear international transformation delivers on anticipated results. Japan is also building momentum and we expect a very strong summer there. And lastly, with China, indicating its reopening, we expect to rebuild capacity in line with demand starting later this year. In closing, we delivered on our key commercial priorities in 2022, supporting a significant improvement in our revenue, while strengthening our competitive advantages. We have started the New Year with great momentum and are well positioned to extend our leadership position in the years ahead. And with that, I will turn it over to Dan to talk about the financials. Dan Janki : Great. Thank you, Glen. In 2022 we made significant progress restoring our financial foundation. We delivered earnings of $3.20 per share, with pre-tax income of $2.7 billion, ahead of our plan. Operating margins of 7.8% was driven by three quarters of double-digit margins. We improved profitability and the strong advanced bookings. We generated $6.2 billion of operating cash flow, enabling continued investment in our people, our fleet, our partners and technology. After gross CapEx of $6 billion, we generated $244 million of free cash flow. We ended the year with liquidity of $9.4 billion and adjusted net debt of $22.3 billion. Our adjusted net debt to EBITDAR was 5 times and our after-tax return on invested capital was 8.4%. We finished the year strong, reporting a $1.4 billion operating profit on a margin of 11.6% for the December quarter. Our non-fuel costs were 13.4% higher than 2019, in line with guidance, excluding a 1-point impact from the severe winter weather in late December. Now moving to guidance, as Ed mentioned, we are including all expected labor rate increases in our guidance metrics, including non-fuel CASM. As it relates to our pilots, if they vote to ratify the proposed agreement by March 1st, pay rates would be retroactive to January 1st. This results in a 3-point impact on our non-fuel unit costs for the year and in each of the quarters. Including this in the full year guidance we gave last month brings our 2023 non-fuel unit decline to 2% to 4% on a year-over-year basis. Delivering a competitive cost structure is a key financial priority. Delta has led the industry an investment in our people and our customers and this is embedded in our outlook, as is a full reset of regional costs and inflation. As we move through the year, scale and efficiency will drive a decline in 2023 non-fuel CASM versus 2022. While approaching 2019 capacity provides scale benefits, we are still bearing the cost to fully restore our network to the peak summer levels, with a continued emphasis on operational reliability during this ramp-up. We expect to complete our rebuild by the second half, with the majority of our flex fleet reactivated and training levels for our pilots reverting to historical levels. This will allow a significant shift of resources from training to production, giving us the confidence in our ability to deliver a fully restored network during the peak summer period, while enabling our operating teams to drive efficiency in the back half of the year. One unique item within the year is the pacing of our core maintenance, as we prepare to step up the network for summer flying with the first half year-over-year higher than the second -- and then lower in the second half of the year. While these dynamics impacting early part of the year, we expect 1Q non-fuel unit cost to increase 3% to 4% on a year-over-year basis. We expect the year-over-year unit cost to progressively improve through 2023 as we complete our rebuild and elevated maintenance activity, while driving efficiency across our operating groups. This cadence is consistent with our full year outlook for non-fuel unit cost to decline 2% to 4% year-over-year. With our outlook for revenue, we expect the March quarter operating margins to be 4% to 6% and earnings of $0.15 per share to $0.40 per share. For the full year, we are regulating our outlook for earnings of $5 per share to $6 per share and operating margins of 10% to 12%, delivering a 2-point to 4-point expansion of margins, including over 1-point impact from higher profit sharing. We expect the full year free cash flow to be more than $2 billion with gross CapEx of $5.5 billion. In 2023, non-operating expense is expected to be $470 million higher year-over-year. These results from non-cash pension expense increasing over $550 million year-over-year due to broad market declines, more than offsetting the reduction in interest expense from repaying debt. We plan to pay cash for our $2.4 billion in debt maturities, while opportunistically reducing debt with excess liquidity. This will bring our leverage to 3 to 3.5 target for 2023 and remaining on track for 2024 adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR to be 2 times to 3 times. Returning to investment grade metrics by 2024, while continuing to reinvest in the business remains our focus for capital allocation. In closing, I want to thank -- add my thanks to the Delta team and people for their hard work this year. We outperformed the first year of our three-year plan and we entered 2023 on track to generate a significant improvement in both earnings and cash flow. We remain confident in delivering on our 2024 target of $7 of earnings per share and generating over $4 billion of free cash flow. With that, I will turn it over back to Julie for our Q&A. Julie Stewart : Thanks, Dan. Matthew, can you please remind the analysts how to queue up for questions. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs. Your line is live. Catherine O'Brien: Good morning, everyone. So good to be back. So maybe I will start with a question on the capacity bottlenecks that you mentioned in your prepared remarks Ed. So I know Delta itself has made a lot of progress in hiring and getting through a large wave of training, but there are other constraints outside of the airline industry\u2019s control with aircraft delivery slower than planned and aviation infrastructure still fairly strapped at airports, the FAA. Now I know the answer will be different for Delta than some of your peers who are further behind in their pilot hiring, but how do you think about the time line to remove some of these bottlenecks across the industry that aren\u2019t directly in airlines control and I guess really what I am asking is, do you expect there to be continued tension between supply and demand over the medium-term, just how do you think about those rolling off? Thanks so much. Ed Bastian : Thanks, Catie, and welcome back. Yeah. I think you summed it up well and I mentioned at the Capital Markets Day last month that while we -- at Delta and I think the industry broadly provides you, our capacity expectations. I think expectations have quotation marks around them and they do feel still a little bit more aspirational than because there are a number of things that are outside of our control. We are doing our very best to get our people in place. The hiring is strong. We have the team assembled. We need to get them through, principally our pilots through the training -- the limited training devices and school house that we have available to us. We expect by the summer that we will be in position to have not just get through most of that bottleneck, but then the large resource drain that it takes with respect to all of the training that are existing team has to do to train our new employees, whether that\u2019s pilots or flight attendants, mechanics, the airports, reservations. It doesn\u2019t matter where in the system you sit. That\u2019s hard to see. I can appreciate that if you are sitting in your chair, but it\u2019s very meaningful here on the airline. And then by summer, we hope at Delta that we will be able to be back 100%. I also use the term fragile last month when speaking about the aviation system as we continue to return to the skies, and I think we have seen just in the last few weeks a couple of illustrations of that fragility. So we are going to continue to do our best to make sure we don\u2019t fly in excess of our capabilities so that we can deliver a great product for our customers and provide all the tools and support for our employees. Catherine O'Brien: That\u2019s great. Helpful, Ed. And if I could maybe just for my follow-up. Glen, I know 75% of this year\u2019s growth by your core hubs. Can you help us think about RASM performance at your core hubs versus the rest of your network or even better since we know its lower cost capacity? Can you help us think about the margin differential of adding capacity in core hubs versus competitive coastal hubs? Thank you so much. Glen Hauenstein : Sure. I think we outlined that at the Investor Day and core hub is about 10 points higher than coastal hubs and 10 points in margin. Ed Bastian : Yeah. Glen Hauenstein : And about 20 points in terms of RASM. I think as we continue to build our core hubs out we will see, that\u2019s one of the things we are counting on is acceleration of profitability in those core hubs and driving efficiency so we are getting them back to scale. As we mentioned in our Investor Day, we are already at scale in our coastal cities. That was our priority, just because we thought it was a once in a lifetime opportunity during the pandemic and so that was our priority to ensure that we came out in a good position there. I think we are very happy with the positions we have established there and now it\u2019s back to the core where we think it\u2019s actually easier lifting. Catherine O'Brien: Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live. Ravi Shanker : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Ed, you said in your prepared remarks that you have never seen a more constructive industry backdrop. Black Swan event aside, what do you see are probably the biggest risks or things to watch out for the industry in 2023? Is it your previous response on kind of infrastructure and things that\u2019s outside of your control or kind of what are you looking at? Ed Bastian : Well, thanks, Ravi. I -- that\u2019s right. I think the most important thing that Delta we can do is to continue to restore confidence back to the traveling public. We know the traveling. The public wants to travel in outsized amounts that we see continuing and we have to do our very best not to disappoint them as they return to the skies, I think, 2022 was very difficult. In that regard, demand clearly exceeded our ability to supply it for lots of ways, including in the service levels with the exceptional degree of service that we want to provide our customers. And I think we all in the industry owe it to our customers to make sure we don\u2019t fly in excess of our capabilities. So I think that\u2019s the single biggest thing that we all need to pay attention to and so I wouldn\u2019t call it a Black Swan risk other than just trying to stay within our capability. Ravi Shanker : Understood. And maybe as a follow-up maybe for Glen. Can you just unpack your thoughts on corporate in the near term, a little bit more, I think, that\u2019s, obviously, one of the big focus areas for investors right now. You said 96% of corporate in your survey say that they are going to be kind of flat to up in the near-term, but obviously, macro is really choppy. We saw some of the hotel data kind of coming into January take a bit of a step down. What are you seeing in terms of your booking curve kind of any signs at all on cracks and corporate demand given where macro is? Glen Hauenstein : We have had our highest post-pandemic days in terms of corporate booking over the last week or 10 days. So we see a very strong post-holiday demand set. We are in kind of a strange period right now because you over 2019. This is an MLK weekend and MLK weekend was next weekend. So I think once we get past MLK, we will give you a better view. But we are counting on it to stay in that roughly 80%. That\u2019s not -- the survey would indicate that it\u2019s better than that. So I think that\u2019s -- if it does materialize is better than that, that\u2019s upside for our forward looking forecasts. Ravi Shanker : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Your line is live. Scott Group : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Glen, if I look at the RASM guide for Q1, down about 6% just in absolute terms from Q4, so that\u2019s worse than normal Q4 to Q1 seasonality. Any color on that and then when do we really start to see this hub tailwinds show up in RASM? Glen Hauenstein : Right. Well, quarter-over-quarter, we had a 2-point increase in domestic stage. So, and that again is unique to Delta and we think that\u2019s about 1 point of pressure from the 19 down to the 16. There\u2019s another international mix, length of haul changing internationally as well. So that\u2019s another point. And so then we are thinking about this as really being sequentially about 1 point difference to get from a 91% restoration all the way up to 99% restoration. So our core -- for core same-store sales, we are actually seeing first quarter being stronger than fourth quarter and with that sequential improvement from February being better than January and March being better than February. So I think we are sitting in a pretty exciting place right now as we look at how 2023 is starting. Ed Bastian : Then the rebuild of the core. Glen Hauenstein : The rebuild of the core, we wish we could do it sooner. Again, I think, our priority has been to make sure that we can sustain industry leading operations and so that\u2019s going to work throughout the year. I think when we talked about it at the Investor Day, we didn\u2019t really give you color that this is not a first quarter event. While there\u2019s some rebuild domestically in the core, the major rebuilds we expect, for example, Atlanta, which was about 85% last year in terms of seats to be close to 95% by summer and then 100% by fall with Minneapolis close to Atlanta and then Detroit a little bit behind. So we are working on that, that\u2019s our priority and we will get there we believe by fall, but it really doesn\u2019t impact significantly the first quarter\u2019s core. Scott Group : Okay. And then just for Dan, just help bridge us from CASM up 3% to 4% in Q1 to down 2% to 4% for the year? You mentioned maintenance, how much does that hurt Q1, how much has that then helped the back half, any color here? Thank you. Dan Janki : Yeah. Certainly. There\u2019s two pieces in there. Maintenance being one, it\u2019s about a 2-point headwind in the first quarter and first half and it\u2019s driven by engine induction levels and scope of work related to that. As you get into the back half of the year, that\u2019s a 2-point to 3-point benefit year-over-year, so a 5-point progression from beginning to end. And then the second piece of that is related to the completion of our rebuild and those rebuild costs stepping down. Most of our rebuild over 85% of that cost is in the first half of the year. You don\u2019t have that in the back half of the year. And as Glen just talked about, one of the enablers that efficiency is, as we restore the core hubs, these low-cost subs, low CP most cost competitive as we put that capacity and that drives efficiency of our assets and our workforce. That is 5 points. So the 5 points related to that and the 5 points related to maintenance is 10-point progression as you go through the year from the beginning to the end and that drives that continuous cadence improvement as you go through the quarters. Scott Group : Helpful. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Your line is live. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. First, I wanted to maybe ask about just profitability levels. You finished the year with 8% margins and are guiding to Q1 with 4% to 6%, and given the full year guide, how do we think about margin progression throughout the year? Dan Janki : It will -- part of it is tied to the cost progression and as you see that progression being up, and I said to you get about a 10-point improvement in cost from beginning to end, that will drive your expansion of margins throughout the year as you progress, along with what then Glen talked about, which was the commercial rebuild related to the core. So you will see this progression. Certainly, year-over-year, the improvement versus the comp that we are coming off drives some material improvement here in the first quarter over $1 billion pre-tax, a big part of the step-up in earnings year-over-year, but you will also see improvement as we go through the year. Sheila Kahyaoglu : That\u2019s helpful. And then just maybe one follow-up related to that, just margin progression. I think, Ed, you mentioned high margin Pacific routes opening up, I think, it was Australia and Korea, what are one time to two items we should watch for as we see that international recovery help margin momentum? Ed Bastian : Our international recovery is well underway, and if you think about Europe, it will actually be bigger in the transatlantic this year than we were in 2019 by about 8 points in terms of seats. Early advanced bookings for that are incredibly strong, so we are very pleased with how that\u2019s developing. And so what\u2019s really left to reopen is China and that\u2019s -- we are not going to get ahead of ourselves in terms of capacity to China. We are going to be very mindful to see how demand warrants and how this opens up, but that\u2019s the big question mark, I think, in terms of international demand for 2023 that we don\u2019t know yet. I think the others we are very confident that we have a good path forward that will get us back to 2019 or bigger at better margins. Dan Janki : And I think as we talked about at Investor Day, the multiyear progression on international, the structural elements here, right? The next-generation fleet that we are at, the reconfiguration of more premium seats with DPS, better cargo capability stronger partner network, all those are systematic drivers not only in this year but really on a multiyear basis. Ed Bastian : And if you go back in our history, not to go into too much detail, but we had a multiyear restructure of our Asia capacity and that has been a drag on earnings for many years leading up to the pandemic. And now as we come out of that, we feel like our restructuring is really done in earnest and so we should see really good improvements in specific profitability moving forward. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Your line is live. Jamie Baker : Hey. Good morning, everybody. And Glen, it\u2019s been a while since we visited the topic of domestic and international RASM premiums. We know what those metrics were pre-COVID, there\u2019s obviously been quite a bit of international upheaval since then, a bit of domestic change, and of course, the premium market at least is stronger than what I was anticipating in 2019. How should we think about the magnitude of Delta\u2019s RASM premiums going forward and any related timing? Glen Hauenstein : Yeah. I think right now we are sitting probably at a low point relative to the industry given our stage length and the way we rebuilt the airline and I would expect to gain a couple 2 points to 3 points domestically back as we get towards the back half of the year on how we rebuild the airline. So that\u2019s how I view it. I am pleased with -- at a macro level or at an individual flight level, I am pleased with where we are. When you add it all up, sum total looks like we are taking a step backwards, but I think, it\u2019s really the way we have done it rather than a structural look away from Delta or anything that we are losing customers. So I think we are in a good spot for that. Jamie Baker : Okay. Thank you. And second for Dan, as we think about the order book, particularly on the wide-body side, considering the OEM backlogs that -- Catie, welcome back by the way, I mentioned in her question. How should we be thinking about the cadence of CapEx in the coming years? We tend to model you on a normalized basis, but one of your competitors is on a CapEx holiday, another right now is on a CapEx vendor. I am just trying to assess whether 2024 represents a potential peak in cash flow in light of future aircraft needs? Dan Janki : I think it\u2019s steady as it goes. We have been very consistent, very deliberate, very disciplined related to CapEx. We certainly had this period where this past year in 2022, there was some catch-up in there. We are continuing to do that here in 2023 for what was deferred for a couple of years. But I think as you exit 2024, you are normalized. Now, at the same time, we are getting bigger as an airline and growing from that perspective, but I think with -- it\u2019s a good foundation for us as it relates to where we are stepping off in 2024. Ed Bastian : Yeah. Jamie, this is Ed. I\u2019d agree with Dan\u2019s comments. Don\u2019t forget we are exclusively taking Airbus equipment over the last couple of years, the next couple of years pretty much and we will be back with the MAX starting in 2025. So we did not have any supply interruption of any note over the last couple of years through the pandemic this year or the years going forward. So there\u2019s a consistency and I am confident you are going to see a -- you are not going to see any jumps or any significant declines. We are ensuring that we are staying rated within our sweet spot here on the fleet. Jamie Baker : That\u2019s the answer we were looking for. Thank you everybody. Take care. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is live. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey. Thanks. Good morning and thanks for the time. Maybe just start with Glen on transatlantic. Typically, this is a pretty quiet time of the year, but it appears the industry is sort of doing less seasonal shaping or kind of deseasonalizing transatlantic, which probably makes sense in light of rebuild for the summer. Can you just talk about what you are seeing in transatlantic less about this summer and more about getting from here to there? Glen Hauenstein : Right. Well, there\u2019s not a lot of room between here and there. We are seeing really robust bookings for March and beyond. So it\u2019s really, if I look at how we view the transatlantic, there\u2019s April through October peak spring, March is getting to be a peak month these days. So that leaves you really the non-holiday weeks in November and the non-holiday weeks in January and February as really your low periods and so how we have shaped it this year is we have had a bigger transatlantic in 2019. We had some operational issues in Amsterdam. Excluding those, we were very pleased with the results in the off-peak season and it\u2019s setting up really well. Because I think one of the things that you forget about building up for the summer is the first few weeks for the high point of sale U.S. travel are always throwaway weeks, because you have got a significant amount of outbound traffic and very light inbound traffic. So getting those out of the way earlier in the season and really allowing the summer peak to be even more robust than it has been before is, I think, how we are shaping. So I don\u2019t know if I answered your question, but I\u2019d say we really like what we saw. There are things we are going to do differently next year. There are learnings from this year that we can improve on. So we are excited about those learnings and then really excited about the summer peak season to Europe. We think this is going to be a record breaker. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thank you, Glen. And then just on fuel, maybe this is Ed or Dan. You own a refinery. Can you talk a little bit about your outlook for jet fuel, and I am not asking for guidance, we can obviously see that. But just with respect to the unusually high crack spreads and refining margins, which week-to-week look like we are going to get relief and then that relief sort of goes away, obviously, you have a hedge in that regard, but I wondered if you could talk kind of intermediate term about when the -- when we see sort of refining margin relief? Dan Janki : Yeah. No. You saw it constrained markets throughout 2022 state elevated certainly was disrupted significantly in the second quarter, particularly we don\u2019t anticipate it being at those levels for the current year giving back. But I would say for the next 12 months to 18 months, I think, you are at least in a period where you are structurally constrained. The global flows for both oil and refined products have changed. Things that used to revert both gasoline diesel and jet coming out of Europe into the U.S. aren\u2019t taking place. Utilization of refineries are high and you get disruptions, you have seen it as the winter storms came through in December and incredibly low temperatures. Refineries were impacted and you are seeing the rippling effect here in January and the unusual nature even in the last seven days to 10 days, where the physical market is short. Jet many times throughout 2022 it was diesel and you see a spike. And then the -- as the refineries get the utilization back up and optimize you get a balancing, but they are still tight and we expect them to stay elevated. Duane Pfennigwerth : Appreciate the thoughts. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is live. Savi Syth : Hey. Good morning. Glen, could you talk a little bit more about what you are seeing on the corporate demand side on the -- across the international entities and just as you get to the summer, I realized it\u2019s early days, but where you expect kind of capacity be restored across these entities? Glen Hauenstein : Yeah. I think we talked a little bit about that in the previous question, we expect the transatlantic to be about 108% restored to 2019 levels, so it will be bigger than 2019. Most of that is engaged as we bring in the newer, more efficient fleets. So we have some exciting departures. We haven\u2019t loaded our entire summer schedule yet. That will be announced over the next 8 days to 10 days. There are a few more things we need to put back in. And then in the Pacific, absent of China, we are more than rebuilt in Australia, we are more than rebuilt in Korea and we are about 75% rebuilt in Japan. We expect to be somewhere between 75% and 100% rebuilt in Japan. If we do or don\u2019t receive slot waivers -- if we do receive slot waivers, we are probably sitting at 75%. If we don\u2019t, we will go back to 100. And then China is the big question mark, as I mentioned earlier. We just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to go on there with demand. So we are not going to get ahead of that and publish a China schedule for the summer that we don\u2019t know if we can fly and we don\u2019t know if the demand will be there. So we will let demand drive what we are going to fly in China. And then last but not least, in Latin, we are very close to fully restoring Latin right now with Deep South really starting to turn on with our partners at LATAM and getting some really, really positive early results on that. So I think other than China, we are fully restored internationally and we see international restoration where countries are open and that\u2019s very similar to domestic at about 80%. Savi Syth : I appreciate that. And just kind of a quick follow-up, just on the kind of change fees and the revenue that you are seeing here, the dropping of the change fees, what kind of an impact is that having as you kind of think about the network or the revenue and will it be different once things are fully restored versus where it is today? Glen Hauenstein : Yeah. Change fees accounted for almost $1 billion of revenue in the pre-pandemic world and we were on a path even absent the pandemic to change fees. They have become onerous, people didn\u2019t like them and trying to give customers what they want, we were on a path to a different approach that got accelerated and I think we are very happy with where we are today, giving customers choice in how they want to fly. And I\u2019d say we are counting on about half of that $1 billion to be replaced by people who want flexible, fully refundable at time of purchase, which is an option that they are choosing as opposed to being imposed on that. And the rest of that is then coming from a higher share of total customer base and upsells more than covering to produce the record revenues that we expect this year. Savi Syth : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Your line is live. Conor Cunningham : Hi, everyone. Thank you for the time. Just on the question that Scott talked about the bridge on the cost side. I don\u2019t think you mentioned gauge or asset utilization improving throughout there. Can you just provide some color around where you expect those two metrics to kind of be meaningful tailwinds as you move throughout the year? The reason why I asked is that, there\u2019s a lot of changes on the regional side, I would think that, that would be a pretty big tailwind from you? Dan Janki : Yeah. The mainline asset utilization increases about -- mid single-digit about 5% as we progress through the year. So we get the benefit associated with that and as we talked about at Investor Day, we continue to get the benefit associated with gauge. Glen Hauenstein : Yeah. Conor Cunningham : Okay. Glen Hauenstein : Related to regional flying, as you know, we have about a third of our regional flight that flying that has not been flown today and that\u2019s also one of the disparities between seat restoration and capacity restoration. We are not expecting a significant increase of that until the end of 2023 and into 2024. So we are going to be carrying that\u2026 Dan Janki : We are carrying that under utilization regional\u2026 Glen Hauenstein : \u2026under utilization. Dan Janki : \u2026 network absolutely in our run rate. Conor Cunningham : Okay. Okay. That makes sense. And then on the Amex targets, I am a little surprised that those aren\u2019t being revised up from 6.5%, from 5.5%, I mean that\u2019s basically mirroring the capacity growth year-over-year. I would just think that there would be some outperformance just given the fact that, that portfolio has grown a fair bit. Can you just talk about like what you need to see to push those targets up or did you just see a lot of pull forward in consumer spend that kind of inflated the 2022 number, just trying to unpack that a little bit? Thank you. Glen Hauenstein : Well, we are pretty excited about hitting a $6.5 billion number. Hopefully, there\u2019s upside to that. I think its January. We don\u2019t want to commit to that. But we are ahead of our long-term goals for that and we continue to find ways to accelerate our long-term goals. And I think next year or maybe even in June we are going to give you what\u2019s beyond the $7 billion, because our first market was how do you get the $7 billion, and when we said that, I think, it was a daunting task for us, it was a daunting task for the team, we are there, right? And I think the question really for us and I was investors, okay, you are at the $7 billion, what\u2019s next, and that\u2019s what we have got to be working on showing you that we are not done here. Ed Bastian : Yeah. Yeah. And the other thing -- Conor, this is Ed. It\u2019s not driven by capacity, as you can appreciate, it\u2019s driven by the spend on the portfolio. So that\u2019s a pretty sizable increase in portfolio spend as well. Conor Cunningham : Good problem to have. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Helane Becker from Cowen. Your line is live. Helane Becker : Thanks very much, Operator, and hi, team. Thank you. Sort of a question about TechOps, pre-pandemic, you guys were building that business out, it was going to be a more than $1 billion revenue business at some point. How are you thinking about that coming out of the pandemic and into sort of the middle part of this decade into the end or is that something that is another focus or is that being supplanted by the other revenues that you are talking about? Ed Bastian : Hi, Helane. How are you? This is Ed. We are\u2026 Helane Becker : Good. Ed Bastian : \u2026 incredibly excited about your question and the MRO, and in fact, we made great progress during the pandemic to continue to accelerate that vision when we sign a deal to acquire the LEAP as part of the MAX deal. So we now have basically all the new engine technologies on our platform with exclusive arrangements and opportunities for third-party work that will extend over the next 20 years. Obviously, in the short-term, our focus is on -- to every extent we have labor and we have supply challenges focusing on the Delta metal and continuing to get the airline itself back up and running. So the MRO has taken a little bit of a backseat over the short-term. But we continue to make the investments where we have got the commitments from all of our partners on the engine side and this is something you are going to hear a fair bit about in June when we look at the strategic discussion that we are looking to create. Helane Becker : Right. In June. Okay. That\u2019s going to be really helpful. And then, Ed, can I please ask you in June, if you will also update us on your diversity and inclusion targets. We talked a lot about that pre-pandemic and then during the pandemic, you have obviously hired 25,000 new people. You mentioned that in your prepared remarks. Can you also at some point update us on how that\u2019s going and whether you are meeting your own internal goals? You don\u2019t have to share those with us, but if you can share with us how it\u2019s coming along? That might be helpful. Ed Bastian : We will certainly do that, and that was already in the plan, Helane, to go through that in June. The good news is that we are making great progress and we will share our targets, because we share them publicly. Helane Becker : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks so much, team. Ed Bastian : Thank you. Glen Hauenstein : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Andrew Didora from Bank of America. Your line is live. Andrew Didora : Hi. Good morning, everyone. First question for Glen, I guess, based on my math, it seems like you are assuming PRASM could start to decline sort of in the high-single digits year-over-year as you move through 2023 to kind of get to your 15% to 20% revenue outlook. What drives that assumption particularly given kind of the RASM benefit you should have from your mid-continent growth strategy? Glen Hauenstein : I think when we look at the progression through the quarter we had some very extenuating circumstances last second quarter and early third quarter with fuel running up over $120 a barrel. And as we think about how we do fuel recapture on the way up, we also as inflation cools down and as fuel comes down, we are not going to keep all of that. We are going to keep as much of it as we can and we are not anticipating that big mobile and fuel, which is driving the sequential decrease. So we will see how it actually rolls out and hopefully it\u2019s better than that, but that\u2019s how we are thinking about how the year progresses in terms of absolute unit revenues. Andrew Didora : Yeah. That makes sense. And then I just ask you kind of strategically here, Glen. As you see -- as you have seen the revenue environment continue to show this strength pretty much since kind of almost a year ago, are you seeing any changes in behavior from any of your competitors that may show that they are acting differently today than they would have pre-pandemic? Thank you. Glen Hauenstein : Yeah. We don\u2019t really talk about how our competitors behave. I think what we have seen is we have seen a very big shift in how and why people travel and trying to stay ahead of that in our own planning and make sure that we are capturing where people want to go and what products they want to buy and that\u2019s really our continued focus and it\u2019s been a very interesting journey. Andrew Didora : Yeah. Glen Hauenstein : And as you look at individual market levels, we are very different sizes than we were pre-pandemic based on where our customers want us to take in these days. Andrew Didora : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live. Mike Linenberg : Oh! Hey. Good morning, everyone. Hey, Glen, just a quick question sort of following up on Conor\u2019s on loyalty. It feels like with the free WiFi, this is going to be a banner year for SkyMiles, I think, last year $8.5 million. How do we think about the conversion of number of SkyMiles to ultimately those who take -- uptake on the credit card, I think this last year, it was like an 8 :1 ratio. Is that kind of what it\u2019s been historically? Glen Hauenstein : Yeah. I think that\u2019s about right. That\u2019s one of the -- we see the more engaged the customers with Delta, the higher their satisfaction is and so that\u2019s really part of that ecosystem that we are really trying to grow is, SkyMiles is an entry point, of course, as everybody knows it\u2019s free and now they have an incentive to do that, because there\u2019s an immediate benefit to join because you get the free WiFi and so how do we translate that ultimately into more loyal customers who eventually will wind up getting some of our other products and that\u2019s really what our flywheel is right now and how we are going to continue to press forward in terms of loyalty. Mike Linenberg : Great. Very good. And then just second question on Dan, you talked about non-ops, the $470 million headwind, obviously, non-cash pension expense maybe there\u2019s some other items. How do we think about through the year, is that ratably, is it lumpy and what tax rate should we be using on March quarter full year? Thank you. Dan Janki : Yes. 1.3 for the year. The first quarter think of it being closer to -- if it was ratable, it would be about 3.30 a quarter. First quarter will be a little bit higher. We think about it as 3.60 to 3.65 associated with it. And tax rate continues to be consistent, right, in that 24% to 24.5%. Mike Linenberg : Great. Thank you. Julie Stewart : We will now go to our final analyst question. Operator : Certainly. Your next question is coming from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is live. Brandon Oglenski : Keep it to one as well. Dan, can you talk about your normal amortization this year, which I think is about $2.5 billion relative to the $2 billion of free cash flow that you guys are anticipating? And what are your options here, especially in a higher interest rate environment, how does that change your capital priorities in any way? Dan Janki : Normal -- yes. We have normal maturities at 2.4. We had 1.8 this past year and we ended up retiring $4.5 billion of debt. Ken and the team were opportunistic in regards to debt that we can take out that we think is higher cost and has good economic payback associated with it. And given our liquidity position, as we progress through this year, we will continue to look at those options. There are certainly a number out there that are targets for us, but we will either do it through how we have done it with through tenders, but also just as you go open market repurchases and being smart and going after the higher cost debt, that\u2019s a priority. We want to drive down that non-op interest line over time and the team is good at it. They have done it. Did it for a decade. They will continue to do it. Brandon Oglenski : And I guess, Dan, how does a higher interest rate environment here change your capital priorities, if at all? Dan Janki : About changing it, I think, it does -- when it may change in regards to how you look at some of your debt, some of them that are off of LIBOR and floating have become more attractive to retire in certain situations. So, but we are continuing to be focused on, as you know, it\u2019s reinvesting back in the business, but also this path to deleveraging. So continuing to strengthen the balance sheet, reduce debt and drive down those leverage ratios. Brandon Oglenski : All right. Thank you. Julie Stewart : That will wrap up the analyst portion of the call. I will now turn it over to Tim Mapes, our Chief Marketing and Communications Officer to start the media questions. Tim Mapes : Thank you, Julie. Matt, if you don\u2019t mind, could we reiterate for the members of the media, the practice for getting in the call queue and in addition to thanking each of them for their time this morning, just to remind everyone around one question and one follow-up so we can get through as many of these as we could please. Thank you. Operator : Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Your first question is coming from Claire Bushey from Financial Times. Your line is live. Claire Bushey : Hi. I was wondering, what needs in your opinion to happen at the FAA so that what happened on Wednesday doesn\u2019t happen again? Ed Bastian : Hi, Claire. It\u2019s Ed. I missed the first part of your question. Your question is what does the FAA need to do in order to ensure\u2026 Claire Bushey : So that. Ed Bastian : \u2026 no repeat of Wednesday? Claire Bushey : Correct. Ed Bastian : Well, if you saw my comments this morning on CNBC. I think it\u2019s very clear that there has to be a call to action amongst our political leaders, the Congress and the White House to fund and properly provide the FAA the resources they need to do the job. We have long talked about the need for modernization of our air traffic control systems. I think this is a crystal clear example of the challenge the FAA has faced when you have aging systems that aren\u2019t as resilient as they need to be. You have tools and technologies that are somewhat outdated and staffing levels, not where they need to be. So FAA I know is doing the very best they can with what they have, but we need to stand behind the FAA and we need to take them off the kind of year-by-year funding that seems like they go through that\u2019s caught up in political negotiations and realize the importance of having a strong aviation infrastructure and the importance of that to our economy, as well as our public. Claire Bushey : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Alison Sider from Wall Street Journal. Your line is live. Alison Sider : Hey. Thanks so much. I guess sort of a related question, but I guess curious, how much do you think that the infrastructure and aerospace issues are likely to be a constraint on growth for the industry overall, whether it vulnerability of technical systems and lack of redundancy or just controller staffing or what have you, how impactable do you expect that to be going forward? Ed Bastian : Well, it\u2019s according constraint on our ability to grow as an industry. You see the length of flight times they are taking to complete missions. You see the some of the challenges the air traffic control -- controllers have when you get into congested space in the Northeast or down in Florida. There\u2019s been a lot -- it\u2019s just even during the pandemic itself some real challenges that we have experienced. So there\u2019s no question that the investment in a modernized air traffic control system will drive a tremendous amount of efficiencies, as well as growth, which will mean better service for the American public. Alison Sider : Thanks. And I guess can you talk a little bit about sort of what sort of systems or backup or its own redundancy Delta has, like if there was another outage of the NOTAM system like we saw earlier this week? Is that something that Delta can kind of deal with or work around or is that something you need to have or, yeah, there\u2019s anything you can share on that? Ed Bastian : Yeah. The NOTAM system that went down is an essential system and no airline would fly without having that capability. Interestingly, at Delta, we had and have a long -- a fairly old backup technology that does see that and we were able to keep some of the NOTAM information flowing to Delta. So we probably had a little better opportunity to fly during this stoppage as compared to anyone else, but out of deference to the FAA and making certain that we gave them the ability to make the decisions we didn\u2019t utilize that backup system. But it\u2019s an important part of our resiliency and redundancy. Alison Sider : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Kelly Yamanouchi from the Atlanta Journal Constitution. Your line is live. Kelly Yamanouchi, your line is live. Your next question is coming from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News. Your line is live. Mary Schlangenstein : Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to see if I could get you to talk a little bit more about your comments about business bookings remaining steady. It seems like the 80% recovered level in the December quarter is what you had been saying previous to that and I wanted to see if you have got any sort of an outlook beyond the March quarter that gives you confidence that, that corporate recovery is not going to stall at some level? Glen Hauenstein : We do those corporate surveys, and that\u2019s why we do them to see what our corporate partners are thinking about in terms of future travel and it was actually the last one we did, which is for future travel, was the best survey we have had since pre-pandemic in terms of their enthusiasm that more people would be flying in future months than we are flying in current or past months. As I said in the call, we are not counting on that in our current revenue forecast, because sometimes that doesn\u2019t come to fruition, but there\u2019s a sense of optimism from this pent-up demand for business travel that we see could potentially offset any weakness in the general economy. And we are taking a very cautious look, but -- and we are counting on it being stable and not growing dramatically, but it looks like people think it will grow. Ed Bastian : Mary, this is Ed. Mary Schlangenstein : Great. Ed Bastian : I -- you see in the -- in our country a lot of businesses struggling to get their employees back into the office and I think this is tied to that. As companies return and employees return to office, you are going to see another step up in my opinion of return to more normal trends, including improved business travel. You think of a lot of the big accounts we serve are consultancies legal firms, accounting firms, it\u2019s tough for them to get out on the road if they don\u2019t have the offices open of their clients and their customers. So I think that\u2019s the -- a little bit of the choppiness that Glen was referring to, because that companies are intending to open and have had some -- there\u2019s been some stalls going on there, but I do think as we progress over the course of the year, you are going to see more and more of business being done like it used to be done than ever before. Mary Schlangenstein : Okay. And if I can just follow up, I understand about your survey, but are there bookings that you can see at this point beyond the March quarter that gives you any idea of whether that weakness will continue? And then when you said you are counting on that corporate demand being stable, but not growing dramatically, that\u2019s a change though from what you had been seeing. Is that correct, you had been seeing growth, but now you are seeing it more stable? Glen Hauenstein : Clearly, in the early parts of the pandemic recovery, we saw some accelerated growth. I think we have been pretty consistent at the past couple of quarters and we see some stability in the booking curve at about 80% of revenue. So as you know, business travel usually has the shortest advanced purchase windows and is mostly close in. So we would not have any further visibility beyond the next 60 days to 90 days that would be of any significant help in charting that water. Mary Schlangenstein : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Edward Russell from Skift. Your line is live. Edward Russell : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wonder if you could comment on if Delta saw any benefit from Southwest Airlines operational issues in December, was there an uptick in bookings people buying less ticket sent out, any color would be great? Glen Hauenstein : Sure. As you know, we had our own weather operations during the peak Christmas holiday travel period, and we saw after that, when we were fully recovered and Southwest was still not back in full swing that we had an uptick in our bookings. That\u2019s trended in highly competitive with Southwest markets a little bit into January, but we think that will resolve itself over the next six months to 12 months. Edward Russell : Thank you. Tim Mapes : Thank you, Edward. Matt, we have time for one final question, if we could, please. Operator : Certainly. The last question is coming from Robert Silk from Travel Weekly. Your line is live. Robert Silk : Yeah. Hi. When you talk about getting back to full pre-pandemic capacity in your major hubs, are you talking about seats or flight numbers? And then what percent of your gauge up, let\u2019s say, in Atlanta, what will it be up this summer and how do you think about managing crowds as you increase gauge and bring your flight numbers back up to where they were or beyond? Glen Hauenstein : Right. We will probably not, for the next couple of years see the flight numbers we did in 2019. We will get seat capacity restoration to 100%, which means that gauge will go up significantly. When you look at our fleet evolution that was always our plan was to continue to grow not by additional departures but by larger airplanes, more efficiency, less fuel burn, better products and services and so that\u2019s really what we are intending on doing. The pandemic accelerated that and so you have got our average gauge up by double digits right now. That\u2019s partly because we keep taking larger airplanes partly because the regional fleets are less restored. Robert Silk : Yeah. Glen Hauenstein : And we think that will normalize out over the next 18 months, but we will probably not for the foreseeable future get back to the flight levels, although we will match or exceed by the end of the year at the historic levels in terms of seat capacity. Robert Silk : Is there any with the higher gauge, do you end up with more crowded banks in terms of number of passengers or is that a swag by having less flights\u2026 Glen Hauenstein : No. I think\u2026 Robert Silk : \u2026 if you have more crack\u2026 Glen Hauenstein : \u2026that\u2019s why we have done these generational builds across our network is that, we knew that bigger gauge was coming, we needed to accommodate it and even for example, here in Atlanta, we have worked closely with the city to reconfigure the deconcourse to be wider than any of the other concourses to accommodate that increased gauge. So we have got short-, medium- and long-term plans to accommodate those gauges. But a lot of that was in our generational builds across the network and we don\u2019t think that it\u2019s going to be more crowded than it was in 2019 or feel more crowded. Robert Silk : Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, Glen. Ed Bastian : Thank you, Robert. Matt that will wrap our call for today. We are grateful for everyone\u2019s time and participation. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation today.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Julie Stewart : Thank you, Matthew, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our March quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining us from Atlanta today are our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Dan Janki. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta\u2019s performance and strategy, Glen will provide an update on the revenue environment, and Dan will discuss costs and our balance sheet. After the prepared remarks, we\u2019ll take analyst questions. We ask you please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up, so we can get to as many of you as possible. After the analyst Q&A, we will move to our media questions. Today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta\u2019s SEC filings. We\u2019ll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ed. Ed Bastian : Thanks, Julie. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. 2023 is off to a strong start for Delta with record advance summer bookings, the launch of free Wi-Fi and continued recognition as the industry leader, not only by our customers but by Fortune, Cirium and the Wall Street Journal. During the March quarter, we generated earnings of $0.25 per share on revenue that was 45% above last year and a record for the March quarter. Delta\u2019s operating income was $550 million, a more than $1 billion improvement year-over-year, bringing our trailing 12-month operating profit to nearly $5 billion. We generated close to $2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, reflecting robust demand for summer travel. Better-than-expected cash generation enabled us to accelerate that reduction, moving us closer to our goal of returning to investment-grade metrics. All-in, a very solid performance by our team in the seasonally weakest quarter of the year. Delivering safe and reliable service remains our top priority, and no airline does this better than Delta. I\u2019d like to thank our teams for all they do for our customers each and every day. The dedication, professionalism and hard work of Delta\u2019s 90,000 people worldwide are the foundation of our company. Sharing our financial success with our people has always been an important part of our DNA. Our industry-leading profitability in 2022 enabled us to pay out more than $550 million in profit sharing in February. More profit sharing than the rest of the industry combined. And we\u2019re looking forward to larger payouts next year as we expect to deliver significant earnings improvement. We also rewarded eligible employees with a 5% pay increase on the 1st of April, and received strong ratification from our pilots on the new four-year contract, providing well-deserved increases for all of our people. The performance of our people and the momentum of our brand was recognized when Delta was ranked number 12 overall of Fortune\u2019s World\u2019s Most Admired Company list, a remarkable statement about the resiliency of our company, given the pandemic challenges of the last few years. Our brand is built on a foundation of service and operational reliability, and we are committed to delivering the level of service our customers expect as we ramp operations for the coming summer season. The operating teams have done a great job getting ready and we are planning to grow June quarter capacity 17% over last year to meet strong customer demand. This growth is, though, a couple of points below our initial plan to fully restore capacity this summer, as we focus on delivering the best operation in the industry and remain prudent in our capacity restoration. As I mentioned at last December\u2019s Capital Markets Day, aviation infrastructure is still fragile. But collectively, we\u2019re working to ensure resiliency as we manage constraints around the supply chain, aircraft delivery delays and training needs. I want to commend the FAA for collaborating with the industry to help improve the customer experience in New York by temporarily relaxing minimum flight requirements given ATC staffing challenges. Turning to our outlook. With solid first quarter performance and visibility into the strength of summer travel demand, we are confident in our full year guidance for revenue growth of 15% to 20% year-over-year, earnings of $5 to $6 per share and free cash flow of over $2 billion, the three main guideposts we shared with you last December. For the June quarter, we expect to deliver the highest quarterly revenue in our history, a 15% operating margin and EPS of $2 to $2.25 a share. Our forecast operating profit of $2 billion matches Q2 of 2019, demonstrating that the earnings power of this franchise is intact. Glen and Dan will provide more details on the components of our outlook. As we look to our upcoming Investor Day in June, we will outline the long-term opportunities that we\u2019ve cultivated through years of investment, building on our industry leadership position and further enhancing our long-term financial profile. One focus area will be innovation and digital technology, where we continue to grow our leadership position. Increasingly, it\u2019s one of the reasons customers are choosing Delta with significant growth in direct bookings and higher engagement through our digital channels. We have reached an important step in our digital transformation with the rollout of fast, free, high-quality Wi-Fi, which has been a tremendous success. We began this effort several years before the pandemic, and it has required significant investment and resources to achieve. In addition, this month, we began rolling out Delta Sync for SkyMiles members, which will unlock a more personalized customer experience in the air and on the ground. When customers join the SkyMiles loyalty program, it enables us to deepen our trusted relationship and create stronger brand preference. As we\u2019ve rolled out fast, free Wi-Fi as well as other benefits, new SkyMiles memberships have accelerated at a record pace. Growth has been particularly strong among younger customers with a record 3 million total enrollments during the quarter. Thanks to the size and growth of our loyalty program, the value of our Amex co-brand card portfolio continues to reach new highs and leading brands are joining our consumer ecosystem, creating further opportunities. I look forward to discussing this and more about how Delta is transforming the customer experience on June 27th in Atlanta. Hope you all can join us that day. In closing, the industry backdrop remains constructive, and we are well positioned to grow earnings and cash flow in 2023, 2024 and beyond. Delta continues to set itself apart. We are on our way to transcend the industry with our leading consumer brand and deliver financial outcomes that create significant long-term value for our owners. Thank you again. And with that, let me hand it over to Glen for more details on our commercial performance. Glen Hauenstein : Thank you, Ed. I\u2019d like to start by thanking our employees for the difference that they make every day. We delivered record March quarter revenue at $11.8 billion, 14% higher than 2019 on 2% less capacity. Total unit revenues, or TRASM was 16% higher than the same period in 2019. These results include approximately 1-point impact from flying less capacity than initially planned. Consumer demand was well ahead of pre-pandemic levels and drove strength in domestic and international travel. Business travel improved in the quarter with small and medium businesses ahead of \u201819 levels while managed corporate travel showed steady progress led by international. Diverse revenue streams, including premium and loyalty, generated 56% of total revenue in 1Q. Premium revenue growth continued to outpace the main cabin. Total loyalty and revenue grew 28% versus the prior year, with continued momentum in our American Express co-brand portfolio. We saw card spend up more than 20% year-over-year. This supported a record $1.7 billion of remuneration from American Express during the quarter, keeping us on track to deliver over $6.5 billion in 2023. Throughout the recovery, travel behaviors and patterns continue to evolve. The hybrid workplace is blurring the lines between business and leisure trips while the removal of change fees has increased customer flexibility, allowing them to book trips earlier. This dynamic was more pronounced in the March quarter, and so we are continuing to adopt and see opportunities to further optimize our revenue management approach to these new travel behaviors in future months. We expect June quarter revenue to be up 15% to 17% year-over-year on capacity that is 17% higher. This implies unit revenues will be flat to down 2% compared to prior year, including a couple of point impact from higher international mix as well as lapping record cargo revenues. For comparison to the March quarter, the midpoint of this outlook is a 3-point sequential improvement in total unit revenues versus 2019, driven by improvements in both, domestic and international. Moving forward, we are sunsetting the comparisons to 2019 and returning to year-over-year metrics. Domestically, we are growing our seats mid-single digits over last year with our core hub rebuild beginning to take hold in June and accelerating through the fall. On international, we are excited with the momentum we\u2019re seeing and expect record revenues and profitability for the summer travel season. To meet increasing demand, we are growing our international seats by more than 20% in the June quarter compared to prior year, and we already have about 75% of our bookings on hand. In the transatlantic, we\u2019re seeing strong demand on our largest ever summer schedule. Our Amsterdam hub performance continues to improve, and we are pleased with the outlook for all of our new markets. In Latin America, momentum is continuing to build. The breadth of Delta\u2019s long-haul network to South America continues to improve as we begin to leverage our partnership with LATAM. Pacific demand is accelerating, and we expect record margins meaningfully ahead of pre-pandemic levels. Our multiyear restructuring efforts in the Pacific are paying dividends, and our partnership with Korean Air is performing extremely well, providing us future growth opportunities. In closing, consistent execution of our long-term commercial strategy is supporting industry-leading margin performance and demonstrating the resiliency of our business model. The long-term investments we\u2019ve made in our fleet, global network and technology pave the way for future growth and margin expansion. Thank you. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Dan to talk about the financials. Dan Janki : Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. For the March quarter, we delivered earnings of $0.25 per share and a 4.6% operating margin in line with our guidance. Our nonfuel costs were 4.7% higher than the first quarter of 2022. It is including a 1-point impact from lower capacity, primarily due to winter storms. Fuel price for the quarter averaged $3.06 per gallon, this including a $0.25 benefit from our refinery, which continues to provide a unique hedge to fuel volatility. Our operating cash flow was $2.9 billion. That was the highest March quarter result in Delta\u2019s history. After investing $1.1 billion back into the business, we generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow. Strong cash generation enabled $1.2 billion of debt reduction. This including accelerated debt repayment of $700 million with an average interest rate of 7%. Liquidity ended the quarter at $9.5 billion and adjusted net debt of $21 billion. Our leverage ratio improved from 5 times at year-end to 3.9 times at the end of March on a trailing 12-month basis. We now expect to complete our full year planned debt reduction in the first half of the year, and we\u2019ll continue to evaluate opportunistic debt repayment. Over the last year, we accelerated more than $3 billion in debt reduction, targeting our highest cost debt and reducing our interest expense. Recognizing this progress we are making, S&P and Fitch both upgraded their outlook for our ratings. Returning to investment-grade metrics is a key priority. We remain focused on reducing net debt and achieving our targeted 2 to 3 times leverage ratio in 2024, while continuing to consistently reinvest in the business. Now, moving to guidance for the June quarter. On fuel, we expect our fuel price per gallon to be $2.55 to $2.80, including a $0.10 to $0.15 contribution from the refinery. While lower than that last year, I\u2019d note that fuel prices remain volatile and are still approximately 30% higher than in 2019. On nonfuel, we expect unit cost to be 1% to 3% higher than prior year. For the first half, we expect to grow capacity 17%, approximately 2 points less than our initial expectations, with a similar 2-point impact expected on our unit cost. More than three months into the year, our absolute costs are tracking as expected. Higher labor rates are fully incorporated across the mainline and regionals. Inflation is stabilizing and we are in the final stages of our rebuild. By the end of June, aircraft reactivations will largely be complete and training is starting to step down with a third of our pilots moving into production. As I outlined on our call in January, core maintenance is higher year-over-year in the first half of the year. We expect it to decline in the second half, resulting in a 5-point year-over-year progression in our unit cost from the beginning of the year to the end. Secondly, achieving scale while restoring efficiency are Delta\u2019s largest CASM levers. The pace of capacity restoration remains the primary level. In summary, we are confident in our year-over-year decline in the second half and expect a 10-point improvement in our unit cost progression as we progress through the year. Running the most reliable operation in the industry is key to delivering a competitive cost structure and underpins our industry-leading margins. Combined with our outlook for revenue, we expect the June quarter operating margin to be 14% to 16% and earnings to be between $2 and $2.25 per share. With a quarter behind us and the visibility we have in the summer, we have higher confidence in our full year guidance for significant improvement in earnings and free cash flow. We are reaffirming our full year guidance for operating margins of 10% to 12%, earnings of $5 to $6 per share and more than $2 billion of free cash flow. And we remain on track to earn over $7 per share in 2024 with more than $4 billion of free cash flow. So in closing, I\u2019d like to thank the Delta people for the elevated service they provide to our customers every day. Our people will always be the delta difference. Now with that, I\u2019d like to turn it back to Julie for Q&A. Julie Stewart : Matthew, can you please remind the analysts how to queue up for questions? Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Mike Linenberg : I have one question, but it\u2019s a two-part sort of pronged revenue question maybe for Glen or Ed. There is this ongoing debate about the pace of revenue growth and whether it\u2019s moderating in domestic versus international. I know, Glen, you gave some color on that. But you did also talk about a shift in the booking curve, which I think you referred to as being pronounced. One, can you dig into that a little bit deeper and maybe how that could be having some impact on the data? And then, number two, when I think about Delta and your network, I mean, you do have the most exposure to the industrial heartland. And you look at the ISM number over the last 5 months, we\u2019ve been contracting, right? The manufacturing sector may now be in a recession and that\u2019s a part of the world that you have a decent amount of exposure to. What both corporate and/or discretionary that flow through sort of Detroit mini -- is there any additional color that you can -- that you\u2019ve seen that you can sort of elaborate with respect to that comment? Glen Hauenstein : Sure, Mike. Let me try and answer the first one. And I\u2019d like to just mention that on Tuesday, we had our second highest cash sales day ever. Seasonality that\u2019s starting to decline, usually those occur earlier in the year. So I think that just points to the strength of the core demand for our products and services, be it domestic or international, just at a combined level, the number two sales day in our total history occurring this week. And so, behind that backdrop of really strong consumer demand across the board, I think what we\u2019ve seen is travel patterns changing and shifting a little bit more than they did pre-pandemic. We had a lot of stability, pre-pandemic, and we\u2019re adjusting here into what I would call a new normal, and we\u2019ll figure out exactly where that lands over time. What that meant in the quarter was materialization rates actually went down a bit throughout the quarter and materialization rates to us is book to flown ratios. Normally just a couple of points, accelerating a couple of points more than usual, probably attributing that to the flexibility without change fees that we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace. And so, that\u2019s really easy to accommodate as we just turn up slightly our overbooking levels to make sure that we capture the higher load factors. And then secondly is the booking trends inside of 30 days. And we were knowing that inside of 30 days was declining, and the strong demand was just outside of 30 days. And so the demand is very strong, and it\u2019s a matter of how many you let through the gate at what point in time. And we had, for example, wanted to go into month 3 to 4 points ahead. We\u2019re tiling that up a little bit to be more like 5 to 6 points ahead, given that the combination of materialization rates, which has some impact on that, of course, but also where consumers are booking. I think those are just RM tactics that we\u2019re using to adjust to this new demand set. And I don\u2019t think that it indicates that there is any softness in core demand strength. So I think we feel really confident in the summer and what we have on the books and what we\u2019re seeing real time in terms of demand. And so, I feel very good about that. Relating to industrial recession, we don\u2019t really see that. As a matter of fact, if you look at Minneapolis and Detroit, they\u2019re actually ahead. Now they\u2019re the least restored of our hubs right now, particularly in Detroit is one tick below the rest of the system. But you\u2019ve also had rationalization in competing hubs in the region. And so, they\u2019re willing to say, okay, well, maybe some of the industrials. These hubs are not point-to-point like Boston or New York, they\u2019re really the connecting flow within the U.S. So, there\u2019s opportunity as we continue to restore those networks to put more flow on the network. Not 100% resilient -- reliant, of course, on Detroit, mostly relying on the flow traffic that flows over to Detroit. So I think what we\u2019re seeing, we see strength in all of our core hubs. Our core hubs are less restored than our coastal gateways, and that\u2019s one of the upsides that we have for the rest of the year as we move through the year. And they\u2019re producing incredible returns and incredibly strong demand sets. Operator : Your next question is coming from Jamie Baker from JP Morgan. Jamie Baker : Glen, as we think about the swing year-on-year in the second quarter from domestic strength last year to international momentum this year. Do you recall what the domestic portion of the international journey contributed to last year\u2019s second quarter domestic revenue, what it\u2019s likely to contribute this year and what the normal second quarter contribution used to be? Glen Hauenstein : Domestic portion of international journey is right around 10% of domestic travel. So, it\u2019s not that big of an impact. And last year was probably 7% or 8%, and this year is probably going to be 8% or 9%. So I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s significant changes in that. The summer, of course, is highly reliant on the local demand since we sit in very big local markets for our international marketplace, so New York and JFK being the largest in particular. And generally, if you can take locally, you prefer local because yields are higher. So -- and JFK is largely 80% local for international travel. So maybe let\u2019s rely on Atlanta, of course, has more flow on it, but still a large local component. Jamie Baker : Okay. Helpful. And as we assess the, I guess, achievability of the second quarter revenue guide, could you disclose what percent of revenue is already booked by entity? International tends to book further in advance. So, I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s your highest confidence. Are we 70% booked internationally and 40% domestically, 60-30? Glen Hauenstein : We are 75% internationally, and we\u2019re significantly less than that domestically. Operator : Your next question is coming from David Vernon from Bernstein. David Vernon : Glen, please don\u2019t drop the mic. A question for you. Can you walk us through why revenues maybe came in at the lower end of the 1Q range, and talk to whether there\u2019s anything in there that was trailing off through the quarter? I ask this because the market is really struggling with whether Delta is limping or leaping into the June quarter. And any color on what drove the source of weakness in 1Q and whether that may carry forward in the 2Q could help a lot. Thanks. Glen Hauenstein : Clearly, I think we talked a little bit about the two components. One was we had 1 point less of capacity, driven by some weather events and recovering from those weather events. The second is the fact that the lower materialization rates in the RM systems adapting to those that we couldn\u2019t do it real time because you have to see if they\u2019re stable before you adjust for them. So I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at in the second quarter. And as we mentioned in the -- versus \u201819, we have positive momentum in 1Q to 2Q, both domestically and internationally. So, I think we\u2019re feeling -- I know there\u2019s a lot of anxiety about domestic demand for the summer, but we don\u2019t share that anxiety. David Vernon : And then maybe just as a quick follow-up. You mentioned sort of corporate domestic or core domestic sort of corporate bookings is 85% recovered. Is the expectation -- can you talk a little bit bigger picture about how you expect that to trend throughout the rest of this year based on the research work you\u2019ve done based on what your bigger corporate flyers are telling you right now and the level of certainty that maybe they have on some of those plans? Glen Hauenstein : Right. Our corporate travelers are telling us they expect that to continue to accelerate. The -- we are not counting that in our -- we\u2019re counting a stable 85% revenue, 75% of traffic. David Vernon : That\u2019s in the 2Q guidance? Glen Hauenstein : Yes. Operator : Your next question is coming from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Savi Syth : Maybe switching gears a little bit. It looks like capacity in 2Q is a couple of points lower than you were thinking back in December. Where is that? Is that mostly coming out of the domestic market? And along those lines, as you go into the summer months, how do you kind of think about the four entities? I know you gave a little color on international and domestic for 2Q, but just a little bit further in. Glen Hauenstein : Yes. It\u2019s being driven by our desire to ensure that we have an industry-leading operational -- and what we saw in the March quarter was we had a little bit longer than we would like in recovering from weather events. So, we can -- as weather shortfalls were and they were primarily in the domestic narrowbodies that we want to ensure we have all the right resources behind them because we know we\u2019ll have weather events in the summer as we always do. So, it was just a bit of a step back, not really by demand, but really by supply, our supply was a little bit more constrained than we had hoped. And that should provide us the ability to provide whatever level we want of capacity in the fall depending on how the global environment shapes up. Savi Syth : Understood. And then maybe a question for Dan. There seems to be less kind of cost of prices this year. Could you talk a little bit about what\u2019s leading to that better predictability? Dan Janki : We\u2019re just deeper into the restoration. And I think as we\u2019ve gotten deeper in, we continue to have better visibility to that. We have all the labor dialed in as we\u2019ve talked about, you\u2019re seeing stabilization in the regionals. That was 1 that we chased last year. As it relates to third-party suppliers, the peak of contract inquiries and repricing was heavy in fourth quarter of \u201821 begin in the first half of \u201822. And if you look at those requests, coming in, they\u2019ve dropped up meaningfully for that. So, I think you\u2019re starting to see that stabilization in the inflation component of third-party and coming in very in line with what we expected from that perspective. So just better visibility. I think we\u2019re deeper into the restoration. So operationally, arms on it related to that. So, our absolute cost visibility is good at this point in time. Certainly, the unit cost metric, as we\u2019ve talked about, is impacted by the ultimate capacity that we fly. Operator : Your next question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Most of the sort of short-term revenue questions have been asked. But just on corporate, can you talk a little bit about maybe the changes, if any, that you saw since mid-March, any commentary on financial services or banking in particular? And then relatedly, there\u2019s so much -- there\u2019s so many headlines around technology and layoffs, and I know you\u2019re less levered to that. But could you just contrast how recovered is the technology vertical from a corporate travel perspective relative to other industries that you serve? Glen Hauenstein : Sure. Technology is one of the least recovered. Financial services is actually showing some momentum, surprisingly. And so, I think as we think about our geographic pull, one of the things we\u2019re excited about is New York was really not back last year. And of course, we have a lot of exposure to New York, and we\u2019re seeing really good -- New York not only as an origin market improvement, but New York is a destination market improvements as well. So, that should bode well for us for the summer. And again, I think what\u2019s really interesting is more of the forward lines between the yields of corporate and high-yield leisure that didn\u2019t exist back pre-pandemic 5 years ago. And so where we\u2019re not selling those premium seats to corporates, we are selling them at near corporate rates to high-end leisure customers, and that\u2019s really providing a very nice insulation for us. Ed Bastian : Duane, one thing I\u2019d add to that is that you\u2019re seeing corporately a pretty significant push to get workers back in the office. And we have seen a high correlation between the opening of offices with the return of corporate travel, principally with consultancies, advisers, people being available to take meetings. And so, that underlies the strength. And I think you\u2019re going to continue to see that over the course of the year is going to be, I think, a good tailwind for us on the corporate revenue front. Duane Pfennigwerth : And then just on -- for my follow-up, with respect to the core hub restoration and maybe getting back some of your RASM premium to the extent that you see that as a driver. Where are we on core hub restoration and sort of what part of the calendar as we think about the balance of 2023, would you expect that to really contribute? And thanks for taking the questions. Glen Hauenstein : No, thanks for that question because I think it\u2019s very important. I think when we outlined back in December, core restoration is one of the highlights of 2023 that is distinctive about Delta\u2019s. What we didn\u2019t say is when that occurred in \u201823 and kind of a mea culpa on that because in the first half of the year, that really wasn\u2019t what happened. It starts right around now and it goes through the fall. So that should be really a key driver for us as we move through the back half of the year, both on cost and revenue. Dan Janki : Yes, revenue and costs. Yes. Operator : Your next question is coming from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Conor Cunningham : So, the range of outcomes on revenue is still pretty wide for the full year. I was just curious if you could unpack the high and low assumptions. Presumably, you have pretty good visibility on the first half. Just curious on the swing factors as you think about the second half for your revenue. Glen Hauenstein : I think we see the same reports that all everybody sees. I think Ed outlined very well that we think there is still remaining pent-up demand from the $300 billion that was not spent on airline travel during the pandemic. So, we\u2019ll see how that plays out in the fall, and we have a lot of flexibility in terms of what we offer as we get out of the summer. What we\u2019re saying today is we are confident through the summer. And then, we\u2019ll take another look as we get closer to it, do we see any demand trends changing. I think what we hear from the marketplace, everybody is looking for those lines. We don\u2019t see them right now. So we would tell you if we did. And if we do see them, we\u2019ll make the adjustments that would be required for the fall. Conor Cunningham : Okay. And then maybe following up on Savi\u2019s earlier question. Dan, I think you mentioned that you have 2 points lower capacity in the first half, which is certain CASM ex. And I don\u2019t think you changed your 2023 capacity and cost guidance. So, just curious like what the offsets might be, or is the first half impact just going to impact the full year from that level? Thank you. Dan Janki : Yes. We -- sure, Conor. We had the 2-point impact on capacity. That had a 2-point impact on unit cost. We\u2019re still sitting here in April. So, we have a lot of the year to play out as it relates to capacity. And as we progress through the year and set that that will ultimately determine it. If you went through the year and you made that up, you pick that up. If not, it would have a corresponding impact on unit cost as you progress. But as we talked about on the point with Savi is our visibility to absolute cost is clear and better than it\u2019s been in the restoration. And as you go through the back half, you get that inflection point, the points that we\u2019ve talked about with core maintenance stepping down from being a headwind to a 2- to 3-point benefit. And as Glen talked about with the restoration of the hubs you start to pick up scale and efficiency associated with that. And the rebuild steps down. So that gives us confidence in the progression ultimately will be where on a unit basis, where do you fall out as it relates to capacity impact that has. But as you know here, we\u2019re focused on running a great operation and the alignment is to the primary financial outcomes, which is margins, earnings and cash. Operator : Your next question is coming from Catherine O\u2019Brien from Goldman Sachs. Catherine O\u2019Brien: Maybe just a follow-up [Technical Difficulty] just a clarification on that 10-point cost progression. Is March quarter up just under 5%? Does that mean we should be modeling December quarter to be down 5%, or how should we be thinking about that 10 points? And then that improvement -- that\u2019s driven by cost, you have really good visibility on, right? So timing of maintenance events, I think you said that\u2019s a 5-point swing and then some benefit from planned training decelerating. If you could just talk a little bit more about that that would be great. Dan Janki : Yes. That\u2019s right. You think about the 10-point progression from beginning to end, and that would be down mid-single digits from that perspective. The maintenance is the 5 points -- 4 to 5 points related to first half being up to back half being down. The other drivers there is rebuild, those transition rebuild costs. We incur about 80%, 85% of them in the first half of the year, really aircraft reactivations, it\u2019s training, it\u2019s hiring components. Those step down and I mentioned that in the prepared remarks, pilots being one and the crews being one of them. We\u2019re putting 600 pilots into production. So, it\u2019s really the first time over the last 18 months that are actually -- school house will step down here during the second quarter. And then the other components are the efficiency, scale and efficiency that starts to step in as you get the core rebuild, about 5 points of aircraft utilization, and we just get a better use of our facilities and our people as we progress through the back half. Catherine O\u2019Brien: Great. Makes a lot of sense. Then maybe one for Glen. Can we just dig into the corporate sales international ex-China, 90% recovered? Can you just walk us through how that looks from your different cabins? Are your business class cabins running at a similar level restored? And then by type of trip, are you still seeing a similar number like out and back Road Warrior type trips as you were pre-COVID? Glen Hauenstein : Great question. Most of the business travel internationally is in the front cabin. So, I\u2019d say 75% to 80% is in the front cabin. So, that\u2019s fueling front cabin strength. I\u2019d say all of our premium products in the long-haul international markets are doing incredibly well. This is really the first year we have premium economy at scale. About 85% of our flights long-haul now have -- that will be 100% by next year. But -- so we\u2019re flying this for the first time with ubiquity in the international arena, and we\u2019re seeing amazing results on the premium economy count at the Premium Select. So, very excited about the rebound in international travel, both leisure as well as business. Now, what was the second part of your question? I\u2019m sorry. Catherine O\u2019Brien: Yes. Just like on the type of trip, are you still seeing those kind of like shorter Road Warrior out-and-back type trips to the same degree, or are you seeing the length of trip change at all here? Glen Hauenstein : We are seeing the length of trip change and Road Warriors are not staying one day, day trips are down. And that\u2019s really what we\u2019re trying to harness here as we move forward is normally, we would use AP, advanced purchase as one of the big key drivers for separating our business versus leisure. Now it\u2019s really stay. And even with stay, it\u2019s not as defined as it used to be. So, those are the fences we\u2019re trying to rearrange how we think about our pricing systems and fencing. We don\u2019t want to get too much into how we think about that. But clearly, AP is one that we\u2019re leading out of. Operator : Your next question is coming from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Scott Group : I got just a couple of near-term follow-ups and then a longer-term question. So, the 70% booked for Europe and significantly less domestically, how does that compare with pre-pandemic sort of levels entering Q2? And then, the overall unit revenue flat to down slightly, is there a difference domestically, internationally on the year-over-year trend? Glen Hauenstein : We are -- 75% is about where we would expect to be at this point in time for international long haul. Domestic, we are within a couple of points where we would expect to be. It\u2019s really the -- how much you want to take in advance. And when you think about 90 days, it\u2019s not all 90 days. Inside of 30 days, we want to be ahead. So, that\u2019s the difference. Second question, I\u2019m sorry. Scott Group : There was just like the RASM for the unit revenue flat to down slightly for Q2, is there a difference domestic, international? Glen Hauenstein : Yes. It\u2019s a mix difference. International is up significantly and domestic is relatively flat versus year-over-year. Scott Group : And then, Ed, you -- on the prepared comments, you said you expect strong earnings growth again in 2024. Is that a market macro comment, or are there company-specific tailwinds that you have that you can share? Just like when I look at the second half guide, right, it\u2019s sort of flattish year-over-year. So, what changes in \u201824 to get back to strong earnings growth, anything company-specific? Ed Bastian : Well, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re inferring on the second half guide. We really haven\u2019t given a second half guide. I think you\u2019re just backing into the overall -- we haven\u2019t updated our full year. I think it\u2019s too early in the year to give an updated \u201823 guide, but if you look at our \u201824 guide, it\u2019s to get to north of $7 a share. And that\u2019s the trajectory we\u2019re on. And to -- one comment I made, which I haven\u2019t heard anyone pick up on, for the second quarter forecast we are forecasting to be already at $2 billion of operating profit, which is the same amount that we were at the second quarter of \u201819. It\u2019s quite a statement in terms of how the recovery is going and you consider that at a much higher fuel price, it\u2019s at much higher labor rates, and it\u2019s also with the system not restored. So, I think all of that gives you continued opportunities. We\u2019re looking to take the nonfuel CASM down in the back half of the year, which is going to be a meaningful tailwind for us. We don\u2019t see revenue declines in terms of demand strength. I know everyone has their own point of view on that, and we don\u2019t have a great crystal ball beyond the next four or five months. But from what we\u2019re hearing from our travelers, what we\u2019re hearing from the market, what we\u2019re hearing from agencies, this is a very different recovery trajectory than other consumer businesses are experiencing. Operator : Your next question is coming from Andrew Didora from Bank of America. Andrew Didora : So, the $11 billion air traffic liability, pretty staggering number here versus the $6 billion to $7 billion that you had in 2019. I assume it\u2019s this number that gives you a lot of the confidence in your outlook. But I guess my question, just curious if any of the dynamics within the APL have changed today versus a pre-pandemic where maybe a lower percentage gets translated into revenues because of no change fees or something else? Just curious there. Dan Janki : Yes, let me -- a few things. One, I think the level of it is what gives us confidence in the second quarter and the second quarter revenue and revenue through this summer, the strength that we\u2019re seeing both internationally and domestic. You get the benefit of the people more comfortable booking longer elongation of the curve. You certainly have fares that are up. But I also think with the policies that we\u2019ve taken during this period of time being customer-focused, customer-friendly, people have gotten comfortable with no change fees and booking out, and that\u2019s driven the elongation of the curve. And we\u2019ve seen the behavior within that to be very consistent in regards to how it\u2019s been performing. So yes, it\u2019s a step up, but I think it\u2019s a sign of strength, and in regards to the customers feeling comfortable with the policies and changes that we\u2019ve made. Andrew Didora : Thanks. And just as a follow-up, Ed, we spoke about kind of -- I know you\u2019ve been tweaking down capacity a little bit. But what have you done from an operational perspective to minimize the risk of having the disruptions that you saw during last year\u2019s summer peak? Thanks. Dan Janki : The teams have -- well, we spent a lot of time in regards to just ensuring that we have the right resources in the right places with the right level of training. So, a lot of effort\u2019s gone into this over the past, month after month after month across the operating teams, everything from the crew activity and ensuring that we\u2019re aligned network to crewing all the way down into tech operations in regards to the staffing that we have in place as it relates to line maintenance, they\u2019re continuing to focus on turnaround time regarding aircraft out of service and the associated items. So, we continue to be ensuring that we\u2019re putting those types of capabilities, buffers in place for the readiness and then the proactive actions that we talked about with adjusting June capacity based on -- Glen mentioned it, the resiliency and the ability to recover from storms. We know that they will happen in the summer, and we\u2019re targeting that around areas that we want to ensure that we have deeper resilience around, and the teams are focused on that. Ed Bastian : If I could add to Dan\u2019s comments, one major thing in addition is that our team has another year under their belt of experience. We have a very young team out there and leaders as well as frontline employees and getting through another year gives you a lot more confidence in terms of what we\u2019re seeing. Secondly, we are pretty much through the hiring. We\u2019ve been still higher, but the hiring rates that we\u2019re at now are just normal hiring rates for normal attrition, not the massive bulge that we needed to go through to restore the business. And so not only are we able to reduce the focus on getting out and hiring people we can take the people that have been doing the training and put them back in the business because our employees train and we have some of the very best employees that do the training. So getting them back focused into the business for the summer will also be a very nice benefit as we go through this. But there\u2019s a list of 50 steps and 50 things that we\u2019re doing that we review in great detail. And we\u2019re confident it\u2019s going to be a very, very strong operational summer for Delta customers. Operator : Your next question is coming from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Brandon Oglenski : Glen, I\u2019m going to ask kind of a nerdy one, but your load factor did seem to step down sequentially in the first quarter. Did that have an impact from this actualization factor that you\u2019re talking about? And I guess, can you expand on how you control for that in the future with your RM system? Do we even get to like backwardation on yields or no? Glen Hauenstein : I think, really, there\u2019s two things I talk about in that realm. One I just want to mention, even though it wasn\u2019t in the question was there\u2019s two things we need to do better next year. One is harness the demand set better that is the new norm and post-pandemic world. And I think we\u2019re getting that real time now, and we\u2019ll make those adjustments. And so materialization rate is relatively easy to combat because it just relates to your overbooking model. So, if you were at 103% on average, and you have two extra points, you just go to 105 in terms of what your ability to take is. There\u2019s a little bit of risk in that. And so we probably won\u2019t go to 105 right away. We go to 104, see how that works, 4.5. [Ph] And that\u2019s why you have to retrain yourself and see what the actual events happen. Because these are changing in relatively condensed time periods, we don\u2019t want to overshoot and cause a disruption. So we\u2019re going to be a little bit more careful on getting that real time. But the other piece is doing the whole network over better next year, right, is that we saw travel patterns of all that are very different than pre-pandemic and where people are flying. And so, as we get to -- one of the things that gives us real confidence about improving next year over this year is when we look at what we did in January, being able to do that better in terms of where we have our capacity placed. And that\u2019s the part I think I\u2019m really excited about is we now have the real post-pandemic travel patterns, which are very different in terms of cities that fly to in places they want to go. If you take New York to Florida, which has never been bigger, there\u2019s a reason why, right, as people have decided that they can live in Florida and work in New York. And those are the things that we\u2019re now incorporating into our analysis as we move forward and things I think we\u2019re really excited about in the future. Brandon Oglenski : Appreciate that, Glen. And then very quickly related to the ATL being close to $11 billion in your free cash flow guidance for $2 billion this year. Does that guidance incorporate the payment to the pilots? And how do we think about free cash as the year progresses now? Dan Janki : Free cash flow, the -- as we mentioned in December and on first quarter, the one-time ratification payment that was made was not a special item. You see it this quarter, it\u2019s not in the free cash flow. And certainly, going back to the ATL, the cash performance in total, as it relates to the operating cash and where we are in free cash flow gives us confidence in being greater than $2 billion for the year -- first quarter and through the half. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Helane Becker from TD Cowen. Helane Becker : Ed, you talked about something I had a question about actually, and that was productivity improvements, which you mentioned that so many people have a year or more worth of experience. Can you -- is there any way you or Dan can put any numbers around that and just say, it\u2019s like X percent of CASM improvement or cost improvement? Dan Janki : When you -- when -- yes, there\u2019s a lot of different benchmarks used, and you certainly look at this at every operating group. And things have changed. We used 2019 as a benchmark as a way marker, but I don\u2019t know that, that\u2019s always your operations changed how the teams execute has changed. But it\u2019s an anchoring point that we use and we look at our operating groups, each of those by where they were, what\u2019s changed, how are they tracking to those levels. And we certainly have by group metrics, and we know where we\u2019re at. But when you look at the total, when you bring it back up and you think about what\u2019s in our run rate, take out the rebuild component, but just around efficiency, there\u2019s 2 to 3 points, 4 points of opportunity in there as it relates to us getting better as we move forward through the back half of the year into next year. And those are all going to move at different paces in regards to it. The one that\u2019s going to be, for instance, probably the slowest here will be around regionals and the regional flying that we do. We know we\u2019re -- elevated levels were underutilized by almost 30% as it relates to the aircraft and capability, and that one will cure over the \u201824 period and in into \u201825. And then other ones will have a different pace associated with it. Ed Bastian : Helane, couple of added points. We mentioned in past calls, the amount of incremental training that we\u2019re doing is in the hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Obviously, a lot of that\u2019s going to dissipate, now that we get into a more normalized pattern. We\u2019re going to get the employees not just the cost of the training, but the instructors are doing the training back into the operation and providing that leadership. The other thing is that, as Glen mentioned, the network is continuing to evolve. And what we\u2019ve seen is the staffing has been a bit lumpy during this recovery from the pandemic and getting your employees and your shifts to the schedule and understanding what the schedule looks like. There\u2019s a lot of opportunity in there at the airport level and efficiency across the board. So, I think efficiency is certainly a big part of the reason why we expect in the second half of this year to bend the trajectory on nonfuel CASM and start taking it down relative to prior year versus the continued upward push we\u2019ve been seeing. Helane Becker : That\u2019s hugely helpful. Thanks, Ed. And then just for my follow-up question, as you know, being in New York, the FAA asked you to cut capacity by 10% this summer. So, that adds to your inability to be back to where you really want to be. Does that continue into the fourth quarter? And then, have you talked to them about getting more experienced controllers in the region? A. And B, is this something we need to look forward to every single summer? I mean, don\u2019t they have to do their part too in terms of improving their infrastructure? Peter Carter : Hi. It\u2019s Peter Carter. Thanks for the question. Good to hear from you. So that release is until September 15th. So, it does not get into the fourth quarter. But what I would say is that it is hopefully going to be only something we would need to do this summer because we are engaged in ongoing discussions with the FAA precisely on the topic of ensuring that they have the appropriate staffing for that New York -- and frankly, it\u2019s beyond New York, but for our national air system. And I think the one thing you\u2019ve probably seen from them in their granting this waiver is that they are acknowledging that they have an issue that they need to solve, which is really an important, I think, acknowledgment because it allows us to work together to try to solve it, help them solve it together. So, we\u2019re -- it is the most efficient and safest air traffic control system in the world, and we need to continue to invest in it. Helane Becker : Thank you, Peter. Thanks, everybody. Julie Stewart : Thanks, Helane. Now, we\u2019ll go to our final analyst question. Operator : Thank you. Your final analyst is going to be Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Just to switch gears a little bit, maybe talking about the loyalty program, it continues to be pretty successful. Revenue is up 27% year-over-year in the quarter. And I know you\u2019ve laid out 2024 targets. But generally, how are you thinking about growth runway from here, what levers are there to pull? And how do you think about the correlation to the broader economy and the broader macro? And if there\u2019s any metrics you watch more carefully with that. Glen Hauenstein : I think there are two components of that. One is the accounts in force, and that is, of course, related to our ability to bring new customers in. And we have posted record acquisitions in the last year, and we just had another -- in the month of March, it was a record monthly acquisition for -- in the history of the cards. So, I\u2019d say we see real strength in the brand, and that\u2019s really what drives the acquisitions. People want to associate with Delta, and they want associate with the SkyMiles program because it does apply great value to those customers. So, put that in one side and then put them the actual spend on the accounts in force. And that, I think, is more of a fluctuation in the economy. We see that continuing to be strong as we sit here today. But that\u2019s the piece I think that could shift up or down a little bit depending on how the economy rolls out in the second half of the year. But what we\u2019re counting on is that being more than offset by our new acquisitions, accounts in force, and really, more and more premium customers. And I think that\u2019s an exciting thing that we\u2019ll talk about in June. So, stay tuned on details on that. We\u2019ll -- go to give you some more details on how we see that evolving. Julie Stewart : That will wrap up the analyst portion of the call. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Trebor Banstetter from our Corporate Communications department to start the media questions. Trebor Banstetter : Thank you, Julie. And just to remind everyone, we\u2019ve got time for one question and one follow-up each, and we\u2019ll get to as many as we can in the time remaining. Matthew, if you could please reiterate for the members of the media, the instructions for joining the question queue. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Alison Sider from Wall Street Journal. Alison Sider : I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the recent near-miss or safety incidents that we\u2019ve been seeing. Has Delta -- have you looked at your own data? Have you noticed any anything concerning or any kind of trends or anything that would suggest if there\u2019s sort of a cause behind some of these incidents? Ed Bastian : Hi Ali, it\u2019s Ed. We talked about this several weeks ago around the time of the summit that the FAA convened. We thought it was a very positive step to bring all the stakeholders together to talk about what we\u2019re seeing and what we can do to continue to improve upon the very best safety aviation system in the world. Yes, there\u2019s no question that we\u2019ve had some additional incidents than you would see that are a bit out of the norm in terms of timing. Fortunately, the safety systems caught those incidents, but we\u2019ve got to be vigilant at all times and continue to find ways to get better in that environment. So, nothing that gives us pause. It is, by far, the safest form of travel period -- of any form of travel. But we want to make certain the stakeholders are all focused as this industry works through, the infrastructure rebuild that FAA is seeing as well as the airlines are seeing. Alison Sider : And then you mentioned sort of like the relative newness or experience of the workforce as a factor in the operational issues. Do you think that that has played a role in kind of that uptick in safety incidents as well? Ed Bastian : There\u2019s no evidence that that is necessarily the case. Listen, we have the world\u2019s foremost safety management systems and risk mitigation focus in the aviation community. And we knew that we have younger people. And so, we get out ahead of that. We don\u2019t wait for something to happen. We are on the front end of that with training and added procedures, added buffers, added focus in the operations. So no, I would not lay it necessarily at the hands of experience. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News. Mary Schlangenstein : I wanted to get one quick clarification, and then I have a quick question. When you were talking about corporate recovery, and you were saying you\u2019ve recovered 85% of revenue, 75% of traffic in the second quarter, is that like total overall domestic and international corporate, or was that a segment of that? Glen Hauenstein : That\u2019s system. [Ph] Mary Schlangenstein : Okay. Okay. And then the second question I had was on high-end leisure travelers continuing to buy up. Are you seeing these folks buy up into what you would normally see business or first-class seats? Are they buying up only to the top premium economy level? And if it\u2019s the former, is that something that you expect to continue long term where these passengers are buying up into your ultimate highest classes? Glen Hauenstein : They\u2019re buying all the way up to domestic first and Delta One on the long-haul international. So -- and this is a phenomenon that we\u2019ve seen in making it more accessible. I think that\u2019s really been part of our long-term journey that we\u2019ve been talking about for many years. It is something we wanted to achieve is to make those products more accessible to people. And I think we\u2019ve seen success through the pandemic and coming out of the pandemic, once we see high stickiness to those products. So once you start flying in those cabins, you tend not to go back. Mary Schlangenstein : And you expect them to be durable to maintain well beyond the pandemic or post-pandemic years? Glen Hauenstein : Absolutely. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question is coming from David Slotnick from TPG. David Slotnick : Thank you for the question. You touched on this a little bit in the analyst portion, but I wondered if you could talk a bit about staffing levels, both on the flight deck elsewhere throughout the operation and really with your third-party vendors. Have you had any disruption? And do you expect any disruption because of short staffing, say, with caterers or refuelers or anything like that? Ed Bastian : We said on the call that we\u2019re getting into our normal staffing ranges and the amount of churn and turnover we\u2019re seeing both on the third-party support staff as well as the added staffing we\u2019ve hired is starting to get in a pretty good place. So no, I don\u2019t -- again, there\u2019s always a one-off pocket where you have some unique pressure. But on balance, no, that\u2019s not a problem. David Slotnick : And then you say that you\u2019re 75% booked for international travel this summer. Just with change -- change fees and everything, what percent of that would you normally expect to see change their flights or maybe canceling those ones for a later point? Ed Bastian : That will be in the high single digits. Trebor Banstetter : Thank you, David. And that covers our media questions for today. So we can go ahead and wrap the call. We want to thank everyone for their time and participation. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you, everyone, for your participation today.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Julie Stewart : Thank you, Matthew. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our June quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining us from Atlanta today are CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; our CFO, Dan Janki. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta's performance and strategy. Glen will provide an update on the revenue environment, and Dan will discuss costs and our balance sheet. After the prepared remarks, we'll take analyst questions. We please ask that you limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up, so we can get to as many of you as possible. And after the analyst Q&A, we will move to our media questions.  Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ed. Ed Bastian : Thanks, Julie. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us. Today, thanks to the great work of our team, we announced record revenue and earnings, reflecting the strength of demand for and momentum of Delta's differentiated brand. During the June quarter, we generated earnings of $2.68 per share, a 90% increase over last year. This marks the highest quarterly earnings result in our history, an achievement that moves Delta beyond recovery and firmly on a great path forward. Revenue was 19% above last year, and we achieved a 17% operating margin. This resulted in operating income of $2.5 billion bringing our operating profit over the last 12 months to $6 billion. We generated over $1 billion of free cash during the quarter, bringing our first half free cash flow to $3 billion. We continue to repay debt and we've reinstated the quarterly dividend, signifying strong execution on our three-year plan and creating value for our owners. At Delta, transportation is what we do, but experiences are what we deliver, and that's made possible by the exceptional service provided by the industry's best employees. The 90,000 Delta people continue to deliver for our customers during this busy summer season. Over the 4th of July weekend, our people delivered a great operation, completing over 21,000 flights with a 99.5% completion factor and industry-leading on-time performance.  The Delta people continue to be recognized. During the quarter, The Points Guy ranked Delta as the best U.S. airline for the fifth year in a row with consistently high scores for reliability, customer experience, network and loyalty. Sharing our success with our team is core to Delta's culture, and we continue to maintain a position of industry leadership on pay. During the quarter, eligible employees received a 5% pay increase on the 1st of April. And year-to-date, we have accrued over $660 million in profit sharing, in fact more than the total profit sharing paid out for full year 2022. We expect our profit sharing payout next February will continue to lead the industry by a wide margin. We will always be guided by our values of putting our people and our customers first. They are the driving force of our success. I want to thank our entire team for all they do for Delta and our customers. As I've recently noted, the industry backdrop remains constructive. Air travel demand is strong and the consumer is in good financial shape, particularly the premium consumer base that we target. After years of spending on goods, consumers want to travel. It's their #1 big-ticket purchase priority and they desire premium experiences. No one provides this better than Delta. At the same time, aviation infrastructure is still fragile, and the industry continues to face multiple constraints across the supply chain, aircraft delivery delays and training needs. As a result, we see a significant gap between the supply that is in place and what demand could sustain. And we expect this gap will remain for an extended period of time.  Turning to our outlook. With our first half performance and visibility into the back half of the year, we are raising our full year outlook and now expect earnings of $6 to $7 per share. For the September quarter, demand momentum continues. We expect to deliver double-digit revenue growth of mid-teens operating margin and earnings of $2.20 to $2.50 per share. Glen and Dan will provide more details on the components of our outlook. As we move to 2024 and beyond, our path forward is clear. The strategy that we shared at our Investor Day just a few weeks ago positions Delta incredibly well for the future. Our long-term priorities are to run the world's best airline, unlock the power of our brand, transform through digital and deliver long-term shareholder value. Our strategy is underpinned by a commitment to financial performance, with a focus on free cash flow, return on invested capital and earnings durability. We are currently executing ahead of our three-year financial plan and are well positioned to achieve our 2024 earnings target of over $7 per share.  On free cash flow, we introduced a new goal to generate over $10 billion of free cash flow from 2023 to 2025. The strong cash generation will enable us to return our balance sheet to investment-grade metrics, while consistently reinvesting in the business.  In closing, thanks to the outstanding work of our people, Delta continues to set itself apart. We have unique opportunities to grow earnings by leveraging our powerful brand, extending our durable competitive advantages and accelerating our digital transformation. One other point I'd like to add. While our team has been hard at work returning the level of excellence to the skies that our customers deserve, we have not let go of our commitments to our community. Our team was recently recognized as the #1 corporate blood drive donor with the American Red Cross for the sixth consecutive year with the record units of blood collected. To me, these types of achievements are as rewarding as the great financial and operational results that we are publishing today and what makes this company truly great.  Thank you again. And with that, let me turn the call over to Glen and Dan to go through the details of the quarter. Glen Hauenstein : Thank you, Ed, and good morning. I want to start by recognizing our people for their exceptional work during the always challenging peak summer travel period. Thank you. Delta produced record June quarter revenue of $14.6 billion, up 19% over last year. Revenues were ahead of our initial expectations with momentum in June. June 30 was a new record for industry volume and our highest summer revenue day in history.  Total unit revenues were up 1.3% over prior year on improved yield and load factor. Consumer demand strength continues to be the primary driver of our revenue growth. Business travel in the quarter improved year-over-year, primarily driven by international. Overall, international passenger revenue grew 61%, led by the TransAtlantic and Latin America. Domestic passenger revenue was 8% higher on a similar capacity increase. Premium revenue grew 25%, supporting growth in unit revenues and continuing to outperform main cabin. Delta Premium Select is now offered on over 80% of our wide-body fleet and customer response to the product has been terrific with returns outpacing our expectations. Total loyalty revenue was up 20% versus last year, with continued momentum in our American Express co-brand portfolio. Remuneration of $1.7 billion was 22% higher year-over-year with $3.4 billion through the first half. We are firmly on track to exceed the $6.5 billion target for this year and focused on reaching our new long-term goal of $10 billion. Turning to the outlook. For September quarter, we expect total revenue to be similar to 2Q, increasing 11% to 14% year-over-year. On capacity outlook of 16% growth, unit revenues are expected to be 2% to 4% lower. While a deceleration from the June quarter, this is consistent with historic performance between 2Q and 3Q when factoring in the holiday shifts and tougher international comps as we lap the removal of restrictions.  Domestically, demand remains robust, and our core hub rebuild is advancing with growth focused in Atlanta. In our coastal hubs, we are leveraging facility investments and progressively improving margins.  On international, demand strength is continuing, and we are confident in delivering record profitability and margins across all three international entities. System bookings for travel beyond Labor Day are encouraging into the fall. On corporate, we expect steady improvement in demand. Our recent corporate survey shows businesses expect to increase travel in the second half with several of the least recovered sectors conveying optimism or increased travel in the fall. Similar optimism was reflected in Morgan Stanley's recent global corporate travel survey, where respondents indicated travel was expected to grow 9% year-over-year in the second half and 8% into 2024. Delta's capacity growth will normalize to mid-single digits in 2024, enabling us to further improve reliability, optimize the network and drive efficiency to reduce unit costs and support margin expansion.  With an integrated and proven commercial strategy and the best people in the industry, we have significant opportunity ahead. In closing, I'm so proud of the team for delivering a great first half of the year and excited about the momentum we are building. Dan Janki : Great. Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. In the June quarter, we delivered earnings of $2.68 per share and operating margin of 17%, ahead of our guidance and a significant improvement over last year. Our nonfuel unit costs were down -- were up 2.4% year-over-year. Fuel prices for the quarter averaged $2.52 per gallon, including a refinery benefit of $0.04. We generated operating cash flow of $2.6 billion. And after reinvesting $1.6 billion into the business, free cash flow was $1.1 billion.  Liquidity ended the quarter at $8.8 billion, with adjusted net debt of $19.8 billion. During the first half of 2023, we repaid $3 billion of debt, including $1.4 billion of early repayments with a focus on our high-cost debt. For the year, we expect to repay over $4 billion of gross debt resulting in interest costs over $100 million lower than our initial expectations. Our leverage ratio improved to 3.2x on a trailing 12-month basis and this is down from 5x at the end of the year. During the quarter, we announced the reinstatement of a quarterly dividend, opening the shareholder base to yield focused investors.  Now moving on to guidance for the September quarter and full year. We expect mid-teen operating margins and earnings of $2.20 to $2.50 per share in the September quarter. Nonfuel unit costs have reached an important inflection point. We expect nonfuel unit costs to decline 1% to 3% year-over-year in the September quarter. This is consistent with our expectations for a low single-digit decline in the second half of 2023.  Rebuild costs are substantially behind us and capacity is returning through our most efficient core hubs. July marks our peak ASM production for the year and capacity seasonally declining in the fall and winter. As our capacity growth normalizes, it enables our operating teams to drive efficiency. We have over $1 billion opportunity from initiatives across the enterprise as hiring and training slow and our workforce gains experience. Improving our nonfuel unit cost is an enterprise-wide priority, and remains within our control. On fuel, we expect the September quarter fuel price to be between $2.50 to $2.70 per gallon. This includes a $0.04 refinery benefit. As part of our routine maintenance done once every five years, the refinery will undergo a turnaround in mid-September that will continue through November. With production offline during this period, we expect the refinery to breakeven during the second half of the year. With our second quarter performance and our third quarter outlook, we now the full year earnings to be $6 to $7 per share and an operating margin greater than 12% and free cash flow of $3 billion. Delivering these financial results also positions us to reduce our leverage ratio to 3x by the end of the year and significantly improve our return on invested capital. For the full year, we expect our return on invested capital to be approximately 14%, a 6-point improvement versus last year. In closing, we're ahead of plan in 2023. And in 2024, we remain confident in delivering earnings per share of over $7 a share while generating over $4 billion of free cash flow and achieving our investment-grade metrics. As we shared at Investor Day, we see significant opportunities beyond 2024 as we build on the strength of the core airline, leverage our existing capital base to grow high-margin revenue streams and delivered durable earnings through a full economic cycle. We couldn't do this without the hard work of our employees who are delivering for our customers every day. I'd like to thank the Delta people for all they do. Now with that, I'd like to turn it back to Julie for Q&A. Julie Stewart : Matthew, can you please remind the analysts how to queue up for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Helane Becker from TD Cowen. Helane Becker : I just have a point of clarification and then my question. The point of clarification is, Dan, did you just say that you're going to do more than $4 billion in free cash flow for this year, and is that an official guidance update? And then my question really has to do with as you think about your digital footprint and the technology investments that you have to make, how are you thinking about what's customer facing versus what's back office and the cost to invest in both? Dan Janki : I'll start with the first one. And as it relates to free cash flow for this year, 2023, at Investor Day, we raised our guidance from $2 billion to $3 billion. $3 billion is the number for this year. And we expect as part of our three-year plan, we said that we'd be at $4 billion or greater in 2024. And Ed talked about the three-year collective plan that we're working towards, which is over $10 billion for the cumulative period of '23 through '25. Ed Bastian : And Helane, on your question regarding digital, I think I mentioned a couple of weeks ago at our Investor Day, I consider this one of the most important activities and investments that we are making in the company. We are -- on the one hand, we're far along. We've been working on this for a while, but clearly, we have a lot to go as well. And most of the work that we are doing is clearly within the run rate or CapEx run rate. I don't anticipate any increase in capital as a result of that. If anything, a lot of the work that should start sunsetting by the end of \u201924 in terms of moving our infrastructure to the cloud will start to dissipate and that'll create even more capacity within the existing spend level for digital. Operator : Your next question is coming from Ravi Shanker from Stanley. Ravi Shanker : Glen, you commented on the fall. Any chance you can expand on those comments a little bit more, especially U.S. domestic? I think you spoke about corporate a little bit. I think most folks are focused on what the demand looks like beyond the summer, which is obviously very, very strong right now? Glen Hauenstein : Right. We see strong demand both domestically and internationally as far as we can see. And we can see internationally, probably to the end of summer, IATA in October and see very, very strong results there. And domestically, we've seen some very positive trends. I think that was one of our increases in the June quarter, we\u2019ve talked about in the earnings, and we've seen some inflection in terms of closing build, where it's starting to look better as we move later in the summer, and we're very encouraged with those trends as well. Ravi Shanker : Great. And as a follow-up, maybe to Ed or Dan, kind of you're going to hit your long-term EPS target of $7 at the high end of your guide this year, which obviously is very, very impressive. But I think what's the next bar here, what's the next step? Are you looking at $10? And obviously, just give us kind of the long-term outlook and the beyond Analyst Day in terms of the initiatives out there. But what are we thinking in terms of kind of financial targets for the long term? Ed Bastian : Hi, Ravi. We're going to -- we need to get to $7 first before we talk about what's next. And\u2026 Glen Hauenstein : We're only halfway through a three year plan. Ed Bastian : Yes. We've already just increased the current year guide. We will most likely some point next year, hopefully the first half of the year, have our updated long-term plan conversation where we can talk about where we see the long-term financial targets for the company going. But right now, we want to focus on -- we're in a very busy part of the year. We want to deliver a great operation for our customers. And we'll talk more over the course of the next 12 months as to how far the EPS can get. Operator : Your next question is coming from Catie O'Brien from Goldman Sachs. Catherine O'Brien : So yesterday we had a pretty sizable month-over-month step-down in airfare CPI. I did some quick analysis that shows that, that data isn't very correlated to the industry's RASM or yield historically, but it doesn't feel quite right to fully ignore a data point like that. I guess did you see anything similar to that step down in your own data, maybe on domestic or lower end of the field - fare spectrum? I know you're guiding to a decel in 3Q versus 2Q better than what myself and the Street was forecasting but a deceleration, is it as simple as that? Or are there flaws on how that CPI data is calculated where it's relevant to Delta? Glen Hauenstein : Well, the methodology is a sample of a sample. And so we're not seeing the same. And it's a different data point than what we have and what we're seeing. So I'll leave it to that. If you want the definition which I think explains why there may be a big variance to what you're seeing, we can forward that to you. Ed Bastian : Yes. One thing for the call because I know a lot of people have this question. Just think about where we were last May and June, demand had just turned on in a crazy hot way. Supply was really low. People didn't care where they were going or how much they spent, they just wanted to go somewhere. And we're seeing fares up 30%, 40%, 50%, particularly in a lot of the domestic markets where they could travel to. That's obviously not sustainable. And that's the comp set that you -- it's in the data that's being compared to as well. So we're now at a much more normalized level of stability in the fare environment, particularly domestically. And I think it's a really poor comparison to try to draw what that one CPI print was off of a survey of the survey and how that relates to Delta for the future. Catherine O'Brien : I very much agree. Maybe one more for Dan too. Dan, you're well on your way on your $3 billion free cash flow target, I understand fuel has been volatile to see how the ATL shapes up in the back half of the year. But if your free cash flow was to come in better, would there be upside to that $4 billion plus debt paydown you spoke to? Is that at all capped by your level of prepayable debt? Or you're happy to prepayment penalties that means you take down that interest cost burn faster and tee-up the business? Dan Janki : Certainly. Any -- as we've talked about paying down debt is a priority here, generating cash, paying down debt, those two are head-to-head. Any additional cash that we generate, we certainly would pay down debt with it. I think you'll see us -- even in the back half of this year, we will be over that $4 billion that I talked about of gross debt paydown. And our team has been Ken and the team out there have been really good about doing what we've done year-to-date. We've done actually through open market repurchase and other activities, and we're just going to continue to work down the debt. Operator : Your next question is coming from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Michael Linenberg : Yes. Can I -- I just want to touch back on, I think, Ed, you talked about summer being strong, maybe Glen also added to it, for international, not summer but international being strong extending into the fall. And I did note that for many of your seasonal European markets, it does look like you have extended the season into November, December instead of restarting in April and May. It seems like they are coming back in early March, maybe even February. What is -- is there a secular shift that is going on here where you're just picking up more and more international, it's a longer season. Maybe these markets are becoming more mature on one hand? And my follow-up would be, when you look at your domestic, what's the load factor points that are being driven by international? Is it 5 points of load, 8 points of load factor that are on a connecting itinerary? Glen Hauenstein : Sure. On the seasonality, we have extended a lot of those seasonal deferrals because of the way we did maintenance in the past, and we're adjusting that. I think what we want to accomplish for most of our markets is at least a full season of summer IATA, which is, of course [Indiscernible]. And so you've seen a lot of extensions into that period. We've seen travel patterns emerging post-pandemic to Europe that tend to see that Southern Europe has a longer season than it has had historically. And so we're taking advantage of that, while Northern Europe does have a much shorter season. And so trying to work both of those issues to create a network that produces the best returns on a year-round basis. And we have a lot of improvement. We're going to have a really great summer, and our goal is to have a great winter as well. And so that's what we are doing.  And on the domestic portion of international journey, I think in the last call, we said it was about 10. And I think that's about where it's staying. And again, that depends whether you call domestic portion of international journey to the long hauls or to the short haul, including the Caribbean and Mexico. And so the number I'm giving you includes the Caribbean and Mexico, which is really part of North America. If you took the truly long hauls out of that, it would be a lower number. Operator : Your next question is coming from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Sheila Kahyaoglu : You have raised the margin guidance for the year for 12% for 2023, that implies 100 basis points of improvement in the second half. How much of that is coming from fuel and nonfuel cost? You mentioned that down to 1 to 3 points. Is it all just cost benefits? Or are you assuming some continued yield strength in the Atlantic like we were just talking about and benefit from domestic hub restoration? Dan Janki : Yes. When you think about it, first half to second half, a couple of things to think about, certainly nonfuel is the biggest driver there. We were up in the first half, going to be down low single digits in the back half. That's your real benefit related to that on that basis. The other benefit you have is when you think about the halves, you really have a second quarter, pretty similar when you have a fourth quarter versus a first quarter performance in that half performance. And when you put all that together, that also drives that margin performance first half versus second half. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Great. And then if I could just ask a follow-up on cash. The CapEx assumption, does it still remain 5.5? And should we think about the skyline at 43 aircraft for the year, given you mentioned some delivery constraints? Dan Janki : Yes. We've held our -- even as we updated our free cash flow for the year from 2 to 3, we've held our CapEx at 5.5. We're still holding right around that 42, 43 aircrafts for the year, that can always move around as it has the year by a view. Operator : Your next question is coming from Scott Group from Wolfe. Scott Group : Glen, you said that the third quarter RASM would have been in line with seasonality if you make a few adjustments. Can you just maybe give a little bit color on the adjustments you're sort of thinking about? And then just -- I don't know if I heard it yet. So maybe just share domestic versus international RASM expectations for the third quarter? Glen Hauenstein : Yes. On the seasonality between 2Q and 3Q, we had some of the days shipped. The outbound 4th of July was in 2Q, which are some of the best days of the summer, as we pointed out in this. So if you take that and adjust for that, we're about 1 point off to the normal and hopefully we can make that 1 point up in a quarter. But if you look back to last year, I think that\u2019s the more important comp when you see the deceleration from 1 to a midpoint of minus 3. Last year's international RASM went between 2Q and 3Q was up 16 points as the restrictions, travel restrictions went off in 2Q so that had that big surge in demand on a limited capacity last year. So I think we're really -- we're looking at a 2Q to 3Q that\u2019s really right in line with what we think the seasonal norms are. Scott Group : Okay. Helpful. And then, Dan, I don't know if I'm getting a little ahead of myself, but when I think about the inflection in CASM in the back half of this year, that's still with a pilot deal. So as we look ahead to next year -- I know you've already said down low single digits, but strong in thinking that the first half is going to be better than that? Dan Janki : Well, the pilot deal you have throughout this year. And as we've talked about, you have every quarter, and it's about 4 points along with the wage increase overall for all for the entire Delta workforce that came through for the year. When you think about next year and you think about what we talked about is low single digits, really, we've out there with mid-single-digit capacity growth. You get that benefit. And then as you get into the scale and efficiency and rebuild, that is another element that we'll benefit from. So we get efficiency. You won't have the repeat of the rebuild that we had this year. And then the offset to that is the continued movement as it relates to a couple of points when you think about pilots and wages into next year. And that's what gets you to low single digits is the general framework associated with the drivers there. Operator : Your next question is coming from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Jamie Baker : So Glen, does your third quarter RASM guide assume any share pickup at the expense of any competitors that may be alternating their distribution strategy or rethinking their Northeast footprint? Glen Hauenstein : There's two questions in there. And the first question is, I think our third quarter is based on what we see in the second quarter and moving forward, and there haven't been any changes to distribution strategies in the quarter. So I'd tell you, it's what we see today just moving forward from there. And on the cessation of the NEA, listen, we compete well in New York. We've had a long history of competing well in New York, and we're really confident how that -- as it evolves, that we'll be able to continue to win in New York, which has been our long-term strategy for 10 years and we are not deviating from that. So\u2026 Jamie Baker : And on the corporate survey work, any shifts in how individual sectors are responding? For example, is the messaging from your tech customers unchanged from what it's been, that sort of thing? Glen Hauenstein : I think we pointed out that the laggards are the ones that are most encouraged as you get to the fall. And I think Ed has always said, and I agree with him 100%, that your propensity to travel is directly related to whether or not you're in the office. And as we see more and more offices trying to reopen or reopening and people are trying to get back into the -- corporations trying to get people back in the office, I think that's a great constructive backdrop for us as we head into the fall and the post Labor Day period. Ed Bastian : I'd like to add one additional comment there. All these comparisons in terms of corporate travel, unfortunately, are still all made to 2019. And we lose sight of the fact that our economy is 20% plus or minus larger than it was in 2019. So what you're talking about actually is there is a lot of room to improve for corporate America on travel. And I think that's part of the underpinning why we think there's going to -- you're going to continue to see some steady improvement here this fall, and you're hearing it from the travel managers as well. Operator : Your next question is coming from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Conor Cunningham : Just to follow up on Jamie's question. So you do sound a bit better on corporate travel recovering in the back half. But I'm just curious -- like just to be clear, is that in your guide? Or is that additional upside if those things do come in a little better? Glen Hauenstein : We have a continued slow and steady build in our guide. If it was to accelerate beyond what it's been doing, that would be upside. Conor Cunningham : Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the domestic RASM, I think you guys are going to be one of the best in the industry, if not the best. I was just curious if you could unpack what was the outperformance? Is that purely just your core hub rebuild and coastal investment kind of coming in at higher unit revenues? Just trying to understand maybe back to Catie's question, like the differences between regular economy seats and what Delta kind of offers out there? Glen Hauenstein : Well, I think we said that it's been continuing to be led by premium products and services. And our domestic rebuild has as we've spoken about earlier, initially focused on the coastal gateways and now -- right now moving back into the core. And so we have the lapping of the investments we've made in the coastal gateways coming out of COVID now producing very good returns for us as well as the investments in the core, which, of course, come in at higher unit revenues. So I think it's a combination of those two factors moving together. Operator : Your next question is coming from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Savi Syth : Just curious on the international capacity. It's been growing at a faster pace in domestic given that that's where the restoration has been to a greater degree. I was curious how long you expect international capacity growth to kind of continue to outpace domestic here? Glen Hauenstein : Well, as capacity trends down, as we head out of restoration into a more normal growth cycle, I think you will see a pretty even distribution between domestic and international as we head into '24. We really haven't given any guidance on that yet. And internally, we haven't even completed our '24 plan yet, but I would expect it to be very similar split between domestic and international. Savi Syth : Got it. And if I might just ask on the Latin entity, Glen, just could you provide a little bit more color on what you're seeing, especially broken out between kind of near international, which recovered first in kind of the South America markets? Glen Hauenstein : Yes. Of course, we've been really thrilled with the results with LATAM and the improvements in our South America revenue base. So South America is moving at a great clip. And again, the short and medium haul, Latin America markets were some of the first to recover, and they're still continuing to be strong, but not posting those great -- giant gains they did in the early part of the recovery. Operator : Your next question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : On your TransAtlantic JV, I just wondered if there's any new approaches, maybe any learnings through the pandemic that will change the way you operate going forward versus maybe what you've done in the past? How much each side flies, things like that? Glen Hauenstein : We have a great TransAtlantic joint venture. It was the first one and the most integrated and one that we think has huge customer benefits. And it's always evolving. And that's the great -- and we have great partners that want it to evolve. So we're continuing evaluating how we approach the marketplace together. You've seen some swaps in the fall from things that we have flown to the things that our partners are now going to fly. And so I don't think there are any huge headline changes, but it's always evolving. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay. And then maybe just for my follow-up on seasonally shaping capacity. It looks like nominally ASMs peak in July. They stepped down a little bit in August and they stepped down a little bit again in September, which seems to make some sense. Not all your peers are kind of taking that approach. In some cases, August is bigger than July, et cetera. So is this just getting back to kind of your view on normal seasonality? Or is this more operationally driven? Glen Hauenstein : No, absolutely. It's more normal seasonality. Of course, in the South, you have the schools going back earlier and earlier. This year, for example, schools go back in Georgia, the 1st of August. And so we're through the summer travel period in the South where the North tends to go back after Labor Day. So if you look more granularly, you'd see the Southern, the Atlanta hub and the South trends down in the second half of August, and we keep the Northern tier operating a little bit longer and then pull that down after Labor Day. So we are actually getting much more back to where we want to be as we say we come out of restoration to a much more normal seasonality. Julie Stewart : We'll now go to our final analyst question. Operator : Your next question is coming from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Brandon Oglenski : Glen, so I guess -- and I know we're not guiding to 4Q here, but implied revenue in 4Q maybe feels a little bit softer from 3Q for the full year, just given your full year guidance, sorry. Is that conservatism around the off-peak periods like we were talking about back in 1Q with booking trends that have just changed and cancel fees that -- or the lack of cancel fees that have changed consumer behavior? Glen Hauenstein : I just think we know the least about 4Q right now. And so as we get towards the end of this quarter, I think we'll have a much better view that we could share with you on the October call. Brandon Oglenski : Okay. I appreciate that. But I guess can you talk maybe structurally, how are you approaching the off-peak period differently than earlier this year? Glen Hauenstein : Well, I think what we have left to go in the year is we have to get through Labor Day, of course, and I think we have good visibility through Labor Day. Then we have October, which is historically a very strong travel month for business. So we'll see how that unfolds. And then we have the holidays, which are the peak holidays. That's all that's really left in the year, and we have good bookings for the holidays. We have good visibility on that. So it's really going to depend on -- and I think it's potential upside, as you said earlier, it does business travel more, return more than we expect. And if so, then we have some good upside for the back half of the year. If not, we're going to trend where we see today. Julie Stewart : We'll wrap up the analyst portion of the call. I'll now turn it over to Tim Mapes to start the media questions. Tim Mapes : Thank you, Julie. Matthew, if you would please just remind the members of the media about queuing up for the call? And we'll jump in with members of the media. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Alison Sider from Wall Street Journal. Alison Sider : I wanted to ask about -- Viasat yesterday reported it had a deployment issue with its recently launched satellite. Just curious if that causes any potential problems for Delta's free WiFi plans, either for the current -- what's currently in place or the future rollouts and if you have to consider any kind of alternatives? Ed Bastian : Obviously, we were disappointed as Viasat was with the news yesterday, but we're committed long term and they will get through this. We see no meaningful impact to our -- to where we stand currently with our domestic capacity, and we're working closely with them to make sure the domestic performance maintains what we've been seeing, which has been great. I think if anything, it may cause a delayed rollout on some of the international markets. But it's too early to tell. Alison Sider : And I also wanted to see if Delta has any view on some of the proposals that Congress is considering around simulator training counting towards pilot experience hours? Is that something you do favorably or if Delta would have any plans to offer a training program of its own if the Senate proposal goes through or how you're thinking about that? Peter Carter : Alison, it's Peter. Delta has not weighed in on those particular proposals. We think the way pilots are trained is obviously incredibly effective, and it's important to maintain those type of training requirements. Operator : Your next question is coming from Leslie Josephs from CNBC. Leslie Josephs : Also wondering if Delta has any view on raising the pilot age potentially to 67, if not beyond that, at some point? And then also with the affirmative action ruling from last month, is Delta reviewing or looking at its current DEI policies and you're expecting any changes that has to make? Ed Bastian : Leslie, I'll take the first. No, we don't have a point of view on that. I think that's something that within the pilot community, there's a lot of different opinions around. So we'll stand by and observe and watch how that discussion unfolds. Peter will touch on the affirmative action. Peter Carter : Yes. Hello, Leslie. I will tell you at Delta, we continue to be fully committed to our DE&I objectives. And also, we don't have an affirmative action for it in Delta. We always hire the very best. Operator : Your next question is coming from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News. Mary Schlangenstein : With your expectation that the corporate travel recovery is going to slowly continue during the fall, will that step up enough that it will make up for any decline in leisure travel after schools return? Or do you not expect to see that historical dip in leisure travel this fall? Glen Hauenstein : Well, I'll just give you a view of what we do see because domestic demands, of course, come a little bit later on. But for international travel post Labor Day, we see very robust leisure demand continuing through the October period. So combine that with -- hopefully, we'll get some upside surprise on the increase in business, but we're not really counting on anything more than what we see today. Operator : Your next question is coming from David Slotnick from TPG. David Slotnick : I wondered if Delta has any contingency planning or views surrounding the legislation, potentially effect in credit card fees and charges. I know that would probably have a significant impact on your MX revenue? Are you planning for if that works, it plays through? Or having a couple of that or anything else? Peter Carter : Hey, Dave, it\u2019s Peter. Obviously that's a legislation that we're watching carefully. And if, in fact, it becomes the law, we will adjust accordingly. But we don't really think it has a good opportunity to be ultimately signed into law. Tim Mapes : Thank you, David. Matthew, I think that will wrap it up for questions from members of the media. Julie Stewart : All right. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us, and I hope you have a great rest of your summer, and we'll talk to you in October. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation today.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Delta Air Lines September Quarter 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. My name is Matthew, and I'll be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are on a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Julie Stewart : Thank you, Matthew. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, in Atlanta, we are joined by CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Dan Janki. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta's performance and strategy, Glen will provide an update on the revenue environment, and Dan will discuss costs and our balance sheet. After the prepared remarks, we'll take analyst questions, and then we'll move to our media questions. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ed. Ed Bastian : Well, thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us. Before we start, I want to acknowledge the unfolding war in Israel and the tragic loss of life that has ensued. Delta is donating $1 million to the American Red Cross for the International Committee of the Red Cross to help fund humanitarian efforts in the conflict. This includes emergency assistance such as health services, emergency care, ambulance services, and other critical needs. Our inbound and outbound flights to Tel Aviv have been suspended through October 31st to ensure the safety and security of our customers and employees. We're also offering a customer waiver for travel to Tel Aviv for those who need to change their travel plans. Our hearts with everyone impacted by these tragic and horrific events. Turning to our news for the day. This morning, Delta reported September quarter results, posting earnings of $2.03 per share, a 35% increase over last year. Revenue grew 13%, and we achieved a 13.5% operating margin. This resulted in operating income of $2 billion, bringing our operating profit over the last 12 months to over $6 billion. The Delta people delivered for our customers throughout the very busy summer season. And I'm grateful to our teams for all they do for our customers and each other every day. Our people are the foundation of Delta and are our most important competitive strength. Sharing our financial success with our people is a long-standing pillar of Delta's culture. With this quarter's financial performance, we accrued another $420 million towards next February's profit sharing. This brings our profit sharing accrual to over $1 billion year-to-date, marking an important and exciting milestone for the Delta team. The great work of our 100,000 people was recently recognized as Delta ranked number 12 overall on Time Magazine's list of The World's Best Companies. We were the only airline to make the top 100 of this prestigious list. And USA Today readers just selected Delta as the Best Airline in the World. Our operational fundamentals remain strong, underscored by Delta's industry-leading position in on-time arrivals and blue sky operational performance that is reliably back to pre-COVID levels. Following a high number of irregular operations days early in the quarter, driven by weather and ATC constraints, we have seen consistent improvement in our operating metrics. In October, we are running a near-perfect completion factor across the mainline system, and we remain number one in on-time arrivals year-to-date. As we're now in the final phase of our recovery, we are making important forward-leaning investments in the health and reliability of our fleet. These maintenance investments will position us to consistently deliver the operational excellence that underpins Delta's brand. Running a high-quality operation is critical to being the airline of choice for our customers and driving a competitive cost structure. Dan will speak more to this shortly. During the quarter, we also made a $150 million strategic investment in Wheels Up, co-investing alongside Certares Management, Knighthead Capital and others. This new investment structure combines the number one premium commercial airline with the travel and tourism expertise of Certares and the turnaround expertise of Knighthead. Delta's relationship with Wheels Up creates a new premium product line for our customers, and I look forward to working with our co-investors and the new management team to unlock the full value of this uniquely positioned business. Turning to our outlook. Travel remains a top purchase priority and our core customer base is in a healthy financial position. We continue to see strength in bookings across Delta's global network, driven by our consumers. Demand for premium experiences, international travel, and increasing business travel further differentiate the trends that Delta is seeing within the industry. We expect our December quarter revenues to be 10% higher than 2022, with a 10% operating margin and earnings of over $1 per share. This brings our expectation for full year earnings to over $6 per share on a double-digit operating margin and free cash flow of $2 billion. Since raising full year guidance over the summer, our revenue outlook has improved, though earnings and cash flow have been impacted by higher fuel and maintenance costs. Revenue for the full year is expected to increase 20% over last year, which was the high-end of our expectations on steady domestic demand and continued strength in international. With strong top line growth and margin expansion, we expect to double earnings year-over-year and deliver a 13% return on invested capital. Our outlook for 2023 keeps revenue, earnings, cash flow and debt reduction on track with our three-year plan, which we issued in December of '21. As we progress through the recovery, we have made meaningful investments in operational reliability and our people. Delta has led the industry in setting the bar for wages, including a new pilot deal and profit sharing. We are seeing the structural step-up in operating costs amid increasing fuel prices, creating some near-term pressure on industry margins. However, I fully expect that the market will adjust to higher costs as it has historically and reestablish equilibrium. With Delta's differentiated premium revenue strategy and strong global network, we will continue to deliver industry-leading profitability and generate robust free cash flow. In closing, the strategy that we shared at Investor Day positions us well for the future. And while the operate -- the environment we operate in continues to evolve in this post-COVID world, our objectives are unchanged as we move into 2024. With our network rebuilt and growth now moderating, optimizing the airline and driving efficiency are significant opportunities. Thank you, again, for your support of our company. And with that, let me hand it over to Glen and to Dan to go through the details of the quarter. Glen Hauenstein : Thank you, Ed, and good morning. I want to start by thanking all of our employees for their hard work and dedication during the busy summer travel season. In the September quarter, Delta generated revenue of $14.6 billion, up 13% over prior year. Total unit revenues were down 2.5%, including 1 point of pressure from cargo and MRO. With these results, I expect Delta to deliver a record September quarter unit revenue premium versus the industry, reflecting the continued success of our commercial strategy. Domestic passenger revenue was up 6% over prior year. Performance was steady through the quarter with strength in our coastal hubs, where we are leveraging our leading positions in generational airport bills. International passenger revenue grew 35%, with the Transatlantic and Pacific outperforming our already high expectations. We delivered record margins across all international entities this summer and strength is continuing through the fall. Demand for our premium products is very strong with revenue up 17% over prior year, outperforming main cabin by 5 points. Domestic paid load factor in our first-class cabins was a record as we continue to advance our premium merchandising and upsell capabilities. Delta Premium Select has now been rolled out to over 85% of long-haul flights, and the revenue generation from this product has been above expectations and a key contributor to our record international margins. Business travel continues to steadily improve as corporates continue with return-to-office initiatives. Less recovered sectors like technology and financial services saw double-digit growth during the quarter. Our recent corporate survey indicates continued growth in business demand with a significant majority of companies expecting their travel to stay the same or increase as we move into 4Q and into '24. SME and hybrid travelers are producing margins in line with corporate travelers and demand from these travel remains well above 2019 levels. Total loyalty revenue was up 17% over prior year, with continued strength in our American Express co-brand portfolio. Amex remuneration of $1.7 billion grew approximately 20% over prior year. We expect full year remuneration of close to $7 billion and are focused on reaching our long-term goal of $10 billion. Diversified revenue streams, including premium and loyalty, have generated 55% of revenue year-to-date, reflecting Delta's differentiated positioning to the industry. Turning to the December quarter, we expect total unit revenue to grow 9% to 12% over prior year, bringing our full-year revenues to up 20% over prior year. This is at the high end of our guidance even with a few points less capacity than we had planned for the year, reflecting robust demand for the Delta product. Capacity in the fourth quarter is expected to be up 14% to 15%, implying total unit revenues down 2.5% to 4.5% versus prior year. Domestic and Transatlantic trends are expected to be consistent with the third quarter. Pacific and Latin America unit revenue trends are expected to be modest -- excuse me, expected to modestly decelerate given capacity growth related to China reopening and investment in our LATAM JV. Domestic demand remains steady and initial bookings for the peak holiday periods are strong. The ongoing UAW and actor strikes are having a modest impact and we have incorporated those into our outlook. As we move through the fourth quarter, our Domestic capacity growth moderates and, in the first quarter of 2024, we expect domestic capacity to be flat to slightly down year-over-year. We have reallocated capacity to international leisure where we are expecting strong returns and remain focused on fully restoring our higher-margin core hubs. On international, we are seeing continued demand strength through the winter. The Transatlantic remains very strong, driven by partner hubs and southern European leisure traffic performance. We're closely monitoring the situation in Israel as we will evaluate restarting the flights as the situation stabilizes. In the Pacific, we expect to grow December quarter capacity 40% to 50% as we continue restoring the network. While this level of growth will impact unit revenue, we expect the new flying will be profit accretive. For the year, we remain confident in finishing strong with record profitability across all three international entities. In closing, I'm proud of the revenue performance our teams have delivered, and I'm confident that our integrated commercial strategy will continue to drive industry-leading profitability. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan to talk about the financials. Dan Janki : Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. For the September quarter, we delivered earnings of $2.03 per share and operating margin of 13.5%. Non-fuel unit costs were up 1.3% year-over-year, and fuel prices averaged $2.78 a gallon, including a refinery benefit of $0.11. We generated operating cash flow of $1.1 billion, and we invested -- reinvested $1.4 billion into the business. Liquidity ended the quarter at $7.8 billion and adjusted net debt of $20.2 billion. Year-to-date, we've repaid $3.7 billion of gross debt. This is including $1.7 billion of accelerated repayment on our higher cost debt. Our leverage ratio improved to 3 times on a trailing 12-month basis. During the quarter, S&P upgraded our credit rating to BB+, one notch away from investment grade, a recognition of our improving financial foundation. Our capital allocation priorities are reinvesting in the business and improving our balance sheet to investment-grade metrics, with a modest cash return to shareholders through our dividend. Now moving to guidance. For the December quarter, we expect non-fuel unit costs to be flat to up 2% on a year-over-year basis. With the exception of maintenance costs, our second-half unit costs are progressing as expected. As we discussed in September, there are three drivers to higher maintenance : first, investment in fleet health; second, expanded work scope on our 757 engine fleet; and third, challenges across the supply chain. On fleet health and reliability, our investments are starting to deliver improved operational performance. Our September metrics were ahead of August, and October is ahead of September. On the 757 engine, a workhorse in our fleet, we're going through a wave of overhauls. The engines we took off wing over the summer required larger work scope and a higher mix of new parts. Looking forward, we are forecasting higher new material consumption rates. On supply chain, the industry continues to face challenges that will take time to work through. Engine and airframe turnaround times remain elevated, driving inefficiency and impacting productivity. We are working closely with our partners and leveraging our deep expertise in TechOps to manage supply chain challenges. Delta has a long heritage of industry-leading operational performance driven by the best TechOps capability in the industry. Operational excellence is central to our brand promise and a key pacing item to drive out inefficiencies. Moving to fuel. Fuel prices have moved higher since July, adding roughly $400 million of expense to our outlook for the second half of the year. We expect December fuel prices to be $2.90 to $3.20 per gallon, with the refinery expected to be roughly breakeven for the quarter. The refinery turnaround is progressing as we planned, and we expect production to resume in mid-November. Based on our December quarter outlook for revenue and cost, we expect earnings of $1.05 to $1.30 per share on a 9% to 11% operating margin. This brings our full-year outlook to earnings to $6.00 to $6.25 per share on double-digit operating margin and free cash flow of $2 billion. We are focused on finishing the year strong, remain committed to delivering industry-leading margin performance, earnings growth and strong cash generation. As we progress through the 2024 planning process, our focus is shifting from restoration to optimization. Over the last two years, we've grown at an unprecedented rate for an airline of our size to restore our network. Growth is normalizing next year, and we expect operational reliability to continue to improve. This will allow us to optimize how we run the airline, reducing operational buffers, and driving out inefficiencies that have resulted from the intensity of the rebuild. Our capacity growth for 2024 will be focused on Delta's areas of strength. Domestically, we are prioritizing our core high-margin hubs, driving connectivity and gauge. Internationally, we are leveraging our best-in-class JV partnerships and increasing the mix of flying on next-generation aircraft. We are executing against the strategy and financial objectives we laid out at our Investor Day with an emphasis on free cash flow, earnings durability, and capital efficiency. In closing, Delta is well positioned to maintain industry leadership operationally and financially. I'd like to sincerely thank the Delta people for everything they do every day. With that, I'll turn it back to Julie for Q&A. Julie Stewart : Thanks, Dan. Matthew, can you please remind the analysts how to queue up for a question? Operator : Certainly. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Your line is live. Jamie Baker : Hey, good morning, everybody. So, Dan, expanding on some of your engine comments, we're obviously focused on the GTF situation. I realize you're not or at least I don't believe you're directly impacted with any groundings right now. I'm just trying to square the situation against your MRO and your GTF in-house expertise. I mean, is there a scenario where the Pratt mess ends up benefiting Delta? Or should we think more about simply reducing the downside relative to some of your peers? Also how does this impact the maintenance cost guide embedded in your 2024 CASM expectations? Thanks. Dan Janki : Maybe I'll first start with the geared turbofan as it relates more directly to our fleet both. On the neo, we took our deliveries later, so the impact will be modest to minimal. If there are any inspections or things off-wing, it will be in the latter half of 2024 based on the analysis that we've gotten so far from Pratt. We're still waiting on the full analysis related to the 220 fleet, that should be coming later this month, and we will assess that impact appropriately. As it relates to MRO, Pratt is certainly a close partner of ours and an important one as it relates to that third-party capability and we will certainly support their efforts. We're working closely with them on that. We have capacity. It ultimately comes down to the allocation of capacity and availability of material to do the work, but we'll be working with them through the fall and into next year on that. Jamie Baker : Okay, that's helpful. And then for Glen, I've asked about this before, a lot of Delta customers obviously took fairly lavish European vacations this year. You have SkyMiles data on these folks. What's the correlation between big summer spenders and big winter spenders? What's that, I don't know, sort of SkyMiles Venn diagram look like? Because what I'm wondering about is the potential for people scaling back on their winter trips because they've spent lavishly on their summer holidays. Any actual data you can share on that? Thanks again, guys. Glen Hauenstein : Sure. I think what we're really excited about is the lengthening of the European travel season. And that has really gone from primarily ending in the summer IATA season, which would be October, now through November, through the holidays, through the New Year. And really now we're only talking about a six to eight-week period that are the doldrums for Europe. So, the bookings, which most people wouldn't have expected, of course, we reduced our schedule in the fall and the winter IATA season. But our year-over-year comps are actually accelerating into the winter as we look into November, December and January. So, I think we're seeing that continuing into the fall and early parts of winter, and we're very excited about that. And we've also, of course, expanded into a lot more Latin leisure this winter than we did last winter, and the advanced demand for that seems very, very robust. So, leisure is still very strong, and even through shoulder and off-peak periods. Jamie Baker : Okay. Thanks, Glen. Thanks, everybody. Take care. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is live. Savi Syth : Hey, good morning. If I may, Glen, just your comment about domestic capacity being flat to down in the first quarter. I was just wondering if that was a decent trend for the full year or is it -- was related to also, in the last year, the way first quarter kind of turned out wasn't what you expected and you were going to make some capacity changes. So, is that related to that as well, or is it more kind of weakness that you're seeing recently, or maybe strength in international on a relative basis? Glen Hauenstein : It's really a reshaping of the demand patterns that we saw last year. And no shock, January and February are not in the northern tier, transcon, east-west markets, barnburner markets, so reallocating those to warmer and sunnier places. So, our total capacity will be up. Domestic capacity will be down slightly. Core hubs will actually be up with more emphasis on warm and sunny places in Latin America and South Pacific. So that's kind of how we're profiling and really optimization of the demand patterns we saw last year going into this winter. Savi Syth : That makes sense. And if I may also just on domestic revenue. It's been stable at Delta since kind of June. I was wondering how much of a contribution you're getting from restoring your hubs and separately perhaps the domestic portion of international trips, given what you've talked about the strength kind of continuing in Transatlantic longer than kind of historic. The reason I ask it, it seems that stable comment is a little bit different than maybe what we're hearing from kind of the purely domestic airlines. Glen Hauenstein : Right. I think what domestic strength is really coming from are the premium products domestically. And I'm not going to speak for the other carriers. They all have coming in the next few weeks. But it really hasn't been on domestic portion of international journey, which is de minimis in terms of the variance to what it was last year. Our employments in the Transatlantic are up low double digits, but that only represents 13% of our total travel, so really a de minimis impact to domestic. So, it's really coming from the premium products, and they're doing quite well. As I mentioned, domestic paid first-class load factors are reaching new heights every month. So, very excited about those demand trends and I think that reinforces the strategy we've been working on for the last 10 years to have a differentiated product. Savi Syth : Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Your line is live. Conor Cunningham : Hey, everyone, thank you. Ed, in the prepared remarks, I think you touched on fuel recapture. Right now, there doesn't seem to be much of an adjustment on the capacity side from some of your indices participants, despite like erratic fuel. So, just trying to understand if there's a new calculus to how you're approaching fuel recapture right now in the current market. Thank you. Ed Bastian : Well, obviously, fuel moved an awful lot within just the last couple of months. And it's the volatility of fuel that really hits us hard as compared to the ability to recapture it. I think traditionally, we've seen over a two to three-quarter rise. We have a pretty good success rate at recapturing it. When you think about the strength of the demand environment and the fact that across the board, everyone has -- not just fuel costs are up, but labor rates are increasing and other inflationary pressure, supply chain and maintenance costs are up. Everyone has a similar incentive to continue to be able to recalibrate those pricing -- those market pressures into pricing. So, my outlook is I'm optimistic as we're going into '24. Glen can add his own color there. Glen Hauenstein : No, I think you mentioned it really well. It takes time, and when we have rapid fuel price run-ups, it usually takes a few quarters for that to roll into the industry realized fares. But historically, it's always worked. So, we're looking at history to predict the future, but that's what the history would tell you. Conor Cunningham : Okay, appreciate that. And then, Dan, just back to the maintenance costs and operational investments, just trying to understand, I know you touched on it in Jamie's question, but just trying to understand how it plays out. Are you basically assuming that maintenance and operational investments will be elevated in the first half? And then, how does that roll off? And then, when do the productivity gains that you've talked about in the past kind of kick in? I'm just trying to understand how the moving parts are changing a little bit right now. Thank you. Dan Janki : Yeah, certainly we talked about it. We're in the middle of -- Conor, thank you. We're in the middle of the '24 planning process. When you think about maintenance, as Ed talked about, it is a foundational item as it relates to our operational reliability and the investments that we're making here related to fleet health and the work that we're doing on our engines, we're going to stay after here. And that will be with us at least into the first half of next year, and we want to drive that operational reliability. The second part of that is, as you get that operational reliability, that is really what creates the foundation to be able to start to optimize and unlock the cost, investment and inefficiencies that we talked back about at Investor Day, that $1 billion-plus. And as you see that operational reliability continue to improve, our teams will be able to lean more and more into getting those investment buffers out, those inefficiencies that are in every part of our operation. And our teams are working through that as they're building out their operating plan and financial plan for 2024. Conor Cunningham : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is live. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey, good morning. Just on the maintenance investment, I'll follow up to maybe Jamie's question there, is this at all a reflection of your thoughts on future aircraft delivery constraints? In other words, were you always thinking about using those 75s next year? And then just generally, how do you think about and measure returns on capital for investing in something like a 757 versus going out and buying new? Dan Janki : Yeah, Glen can chime in here too. I think the 757 has been a fleet as we've gone through our restoration that we've characterized as a flexible fleet. And it's one that -- it's certainly a workhorse. The returns are very good related to how we deploy it and fly it within our network. So, we have leaned on it. When you think back of where we might have been 18, 24 months ago, the number that we're flying, we have reactivated more as we continue to see new delivery slide, and we get recalibrated year to year. So, it is one that we've leaned into. And it's one that we will be flexible on as we work through the next three, four, five years in regards to how we deploy it. The wave of overhauls that we started last year and we're doing this year and we'll have the same next year, but that gets us through a heavy wave, that then allows us really very viable engines that the Delta team has always been very good at managing the end of life of an asset. We did it on the 90s, 88s in regards to how you manage those assets and deploy them, but also get the most out of them, whether it's in whole or in the parts and how they're redeployed back in the stream. And we are always working closely then with fleet and maintenance with Glen's team on how to deploy them and get the best returns for them. But those are good returning. It's a great workhorse for our fleet with good returns. Glen Hauenstein : Nothing to add other than, yeah, we took a lot of late deliveries. I think our last 75 was produced -- we had the last one ever built. So, some of these planes are not that old and we have them in our fleet and we have -- but as you said, as we get to the end of life of these, towards the end of this decade, we'll be able to really start harvesting the engines, which will really improve the maintenance profile of the fleet. Ed Bastian : And Duane, this is Ed, if I could add my perspective. Your point is right. It is related to the OEMs fundamentally. Their inability to produce engines on time, which they're having their own challenges within the supply chain, as well as parts on time. And the one thing that has been a core part of Delta's strength over at TechOps is our ability to go into the used/repair market and acquire assets and repurpose them towards our own needs. That market has largely dried up given all the large rebound in flight activity, which was running at the same time the OEMs have been having and struggling to produce new. So, I think this is something you're going to see across the industry. This isn't just at Delta. And it's one of the constraints we talked about at Investor Day. It's going to keep us all pretty limited in the amount of capacity that we can produce. But I'd put my money on the Delta TechOps team, because they're the best in the business and we'll figure this out. And we know this is a -- while it may hit the expense line, we know this is a long-term asset that's going to pay dividends for years to come. Duane Pfennigwerth : Appreciate those thoughts. And maybe just for my follow-up on Pacific, and Glen, can you just remind us where we are in China reopen? I think there's another round of expansion here in November. And then just broadly in Pacific, what are the markets away from China that you're excited about? Glen Hauenstein : Well, I think what we're very excited about is the success of our Incheon hub with Korean. And that has really even exceeded our expectations. We think it's the best place to connect to get to Southeast Asia from any one of our hubs or as a double connect. So, really trying to leverage that, and we'll have some announcements on continuing to work to increase our capacity next year. But that's really been a lynchpin. South Pacific has been a really great surprise for us, the demand there, really in tune with that same high demand for leisure destinations. So that's been doing very well, as well as Japan. As you know, Japan was closed for a couple years and our Japanese franchise is doing quite well. So, you put the Pacific together, and if you recall, for years, we were telling our investors to hold on. We've got this restructuring coming. We had the wrong airplanes. We were at the wrong airports. And it took us many years to get to where we wanted to be, but we're finally there and we're producing great returns in the Pacific and we're excited about our opportunities moving forward. Duane Pfennigwerth : I appreciate the detailed thoughts. Glen Hauenstein : Oh, China. I didn't say -- China, of course. We went from essentially double daily in Detroit -- double weekly, I'm sorry, in Detroit and Seattle to 10x a week, with Seattle moving to daily and Detroit moving to 3x. So -- and we'll see if there's another wave of this. I think the first thing we have to see is, is there a demand for the capacity that's going into market right now, and we'll keep you abreast of that as we move forward on China reopening. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Andrew Didora from Bank of America. Your line is live. Andrew Didora : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Ed, a couple of questions just kind of want to bring it back to some things discussed at Investor Day. I guess maybe first just on capacity growth. I know you gave us a little color about how you're thinking about 1Q, kind of domestic versus international. But the mid-single digit growth that you talked about in 2024, I guess, in this fuel environment, would you consider that growth rate as reasonable or aspirational at this point in time? Ed Bastian : Well, it's probably more a question for Glen than myself. But at my level, as I just said in my last comments, I hear -- my sense would be any capacity that you hear from us in terms of plans or the industry, you should read as somewhat aspirational, because there still are tremendous constraints in the marketplace in terms of delivering that growth. If all goes well and we get all the parts and we get the planes on time and we have the labor ready and ATC is not an issue and fuel prices stay reasonable, yeah, that's what's going to happen. But if you look over the last two to three years, we continue to evolve it. So those are just points-in-time estimates as to what we could do. As to what we actually will be able to do, I think we'll probably, across the board, be a little less than that. Glen Hauenstein : And I would just add a comment. About half of that is run rate of what's in there as we enter the first quarter of next year. So, the real number is half of low-single digits, which is very low-single digits. Andrew Didora : Yeah. Got it. Makes sense. And then I guess, Dan, just on costs and CASM next year. Obviously, with capacity moving around, obviously, the maintenance costs continuing into next year, can you just give us a sense of your level of confidence in 2024 CASM-Ex being able to be down kind of low-single digits, or should we think about that differently as well? Thank you. Dan Janki : As I mentioned earlier, we're still in the middle of our planning process. So, all these pieces are coming together, right, capacity, along with all the things that we've talked about. Regarding the maintenance, we're spending certainly a lot more time on that, given all the moving pieces in the industry and elements that we talked about. Ed Bastian : Yeah, Dan's comments earlier about -- this is going to be a pivot to optimization is a big deal and maintenance is a part of that. Maintenance unlocks the ability to drive the efficiencies across the enterprise. And we're right in the middle of the planning process. So, we're not trying to dodge the question. We will give you at the typical time at the start of the year what we think we can do. Andrew Didora : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs. Your line is live. Catherine O'Brien: Good morning everyone. Thanks for the time. Ed, on CNBC this morning you called out a pick-up in corporate bookings. Could we just dig into that a little bit more? What have you seen since Labor Day on volumes or revenue from corporate? Any industries or regions that are bigger drivers or it's really across the board? And anything on maybe just corporate booking windows today versus maybe a couple of months ago, and they're still longer than pre-COVID? Appreciate it. Ed Bastian : Well, we said on the last call that we anticipated post-Labor Day that we'd see volumes of corporate travel pick up. And indeed, we're seeing that. I think Glen mentioned a couple of sectors, the tech sector and the financial services sector is areas that we're seeing double-digit growth. We have, I'd say, across the board we're seeing increases. The corporate travel has come back, it comes back and then plateaus, comes back and plateaus. And I think you'll see another wave of return. I think a lot of it's being driven by the return to office and getting into the new normal work patterns, which many companies are still sorting out for themselves. But it's healthy to see, and it's one of the distinguishing factors between us and some of the carriers that are on the other end of the fare spectrum. So, one of the many differentiating factors that is enabling us to grow revenue at the pace we are. Catherine O'Brien: Makes a lot of sense. Thanks so much. And then one, maybe this is for Dan. Can you just speak to how the air traffic liability is trending year-to-date and into the fourth quarter versus your expectations at the start of the year? I know we kicked off the year with really strong first quarter performance on that ETL build. Should you be aware of any impact from normalization of booking windows versus last year, just given the pick-up in corporate volume you're seeing? Thanks a lot. Dan Janki : No, I'd say it's performing as we expected. We're starting to maybe get back to a little bit more of the traditional seasonality. As we were restoring, it was a little bit different. And if you look at historical patterns, you're only down mid-teens as you go through into the fourth quarter. And that's kind of what we saw as we wrapped up the third quarter here. And so, no. The other element that you have in there is you certainly have -- we've had very friendly policies as it relates to credits and customers have gotten really used to using them. And we think that's obviously long-term beneficial that people have confidence to book and travel, but also consume when they don't travel. And those we've seen very consistent issuance and usage rates on them. Catherine O'Brien: Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live. Mike Linenberg : Oh, yeah. Hey, good morning everyone. Glen, you called out a couple of sectors that were underperforming from a corporate perspective. I mean, I think of any carrier probably the most indexed to the automotive sector and then sort of the media sector with the writers' and actors' strike. What sort of drag do you actually think that had on your corporates, at least in the month of September and maybe what you're seeing right now? Glen Hauenstein : Well, clearly, I'll start with Los Angeles and the entertainment production strikes that are ongoing. That has had a not insignificant change in the business travel to and from Los Angeles, as well as now the UAW strike, which has curtailed a significant amount of the business in Detroit. As you pointed out, we're very big in both of those sectors. And what I'm really encouraged about is despite those two kind of being things that we should look forward to as positives next year, that our total corporate revenues are still accelerating. So despite those two being a drag on them, and I think hopefully, those are both resolves fairly quickly here and we can get back to a normal business level. But you are right, spot on, that we are probably the most impacted by those two sectors. Mike Linenberg : Great. And then just a quick one to Dan or Ed. I didn't see in the release a reiteration of the $7-plus for 2024. I know you're still mid-budget, but just based on the trajectory and everything you're seeing now, that number is still fine? Ed Bastian : That's our plan, Mike. I mentioned that we gave that guide in December of 2021, as long as free cash and others and we're on track. Mike Linenberg : Very good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Glen, I'm probably going to ask Jamie's initial SkyMiles data mining question in a different way. And based on data that you have, do you have any evidence that traditional domestic travelers have been flying internationally more often in 2023, maybe people taking their first or kind of rare international trips? Just trying to see if there's any truth or data to back up the thesis that there has been substitution of domestic with people flying internationally this year. Glen Hauenstein : Well, I'd say that's a very broad question, and clearly, there's been an expansion of international. But if you think about domestic and the volume differential between the number of seats we have every day domestically and the number of seats we have every day to Europe, it would be very hard to track those incremental visits back to people who did not fly domestically, because it's such a small piece of domestic travel in terms of total volumes. And so, while clearly, the spend has been very robust for long-haul in general, we have not seen a diminishing of short-haul either. Ravi Shanker : Got it. That's really helpful. And maybe as a follow-up, kind of feels like Trans-Pacific has not quite been the explosion of pent-up demand that we saw in domestic and Transatlantic when they initially opened, but it looks like 2024 might be a better year for that. Is there any way you think that the historical profitability in that region, which has not been great to say the least, can be better when that initial kind of flow-through of demand comes through with pricing the way it might potentially be? Glen Hauenstein : Well, I'd disagree with you on your premise there that Pacific has been a laggard. Pacific has been quite robust, and I think we indicated these are our record profits in terms of margins and total profitability in the Pacific. And if you look at the Pacific, absent of China, it's been fully restored. So, I think we're very pleased with the demand to the Pacific, and we're -- right now, that's where our capacity is sitting up most in the fourth quarter and where it will be in the first and through next year. And so -- and we're very enthusiastic about the results we're getting there. Ravi Shanker : Very helpful. Thanks, Glen. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is live. Brandon Oglenski : Yeah, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Glen, I know you've called out your corporate travel here being up in coastal hub strength, but can you talk to maybe any areas of weakness domestically? And is there like diverging trends with your main cabin revenue? Glen Hauenstein : Well, I think we've called out diverging trends with main cabin. Those have been pretty consistent, though, throughout the recovery is it's been led by premium products and services. So that's not inconsistent between quarters. I think it's actually relatively flat in terms of the -- how much premium is driving there. And geographically, I think what we're really excited about is the coastal hub investments we've made and particularly New York, that's something we're looking for in '24. We see a lot of momentum in the Northeast and New York in particular, as things to look forward to in '24. Brandon Oglenski : Okay. And then on the outlook for next year, growing with your JVs on the international side, how does the changes in Mexico impact as they move to a Category 1 with the FAA? Glen Hauenstein : Right. Mexico has been a great source of strength for us through the last year, and we see continued strength in those Mexican business. And I think when you think about what we read in the press and what you all see and the onshoring and moving factories from Asia down into Mexico, we've seen really an incredible strength in demand from the business sector in Mexico, and that's looking really robust into 2024. And working with Aeromexico now, we really couldn't do much with them. These are things we wanted to do in the past. You see us coordinating with them. We have an ATI joint venture. So, we've been working very closely with them to continue to work on where we see strength and being able to serve those markets better, including the auto sector in Detroit and including Atlanta as a primary gateway to Mexico primary and secondary airports. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Helane Becker from TD Cowen. Your line is live. Helane Becker : Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody, and thank you very much for the question. Just on -- with respect to as you think about travel next summer on the North Atlantic, especially where U.S. citizens are going to need visas, how are you thinking about communicating that to people as they book trips? Is that going to be in the reservation process or follow-ups? Or how do you avoid surprises? Peter Carter : Helane, hi. It's Peter Carter. Say, we will make sure our customers are aware of the visa requirement at various points along the purchasing path and the journey. And I will tell you that the nice thing about the new visa requirement is it is a e-visa, so it's a fairly straightforward process that we think will take about 24 hours. Helane Becker : Yeah. I think it's like Australia, right, where it's pretty quick unless it's not, I think. Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then the other question I had was just on the changes to Israel. How big actually is that in your total -- in the total market? It's a lot of ASMs, but it can't be that big in terms of, I guess, exposure. Glen Hauenstein : It's a little over 1 point of ASMs. And we're not going to give an exact number, but it's included -- the revenue hit is included in our fourth quarter guide. So, we've extended at least through October and then we'll see what happens. The reason we're not saying how much exposure there is, is we don't know how this will evolve yet, so we're staying very fluid. But I think we feel very confident that we can get inside of our guidance ranges here with Israel kind of in a worst-case scenario. Helane Becker : Got it. Okay. Thanks very much. Julie Stewart : Matthew, we'll now go to our final analyst question. Operator : Certainly. Your last question is coming Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Your line is live. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you. Good morning, guys. Ed, I wanted to ask you a question. You made a comment about you're leaning into the cost curve and really leading the industry here with pilot pay and the like. So, the question comes, how do we think about your double-digit margins today versus low-cost carriers and what they'll report in Q3 and margin moving pieces maybe into 2024, if you want to provide that or maybe the Delta versus Delta and other carriers? Ed Bastian : Sheila, you should look at our '24 guide that we gave you with our three-year plan. The good news at Delta is that we have all of our labor costs at the new market across the board today in posting those double-digit margins. So, to the extent other carriers need to be increasing their labor cost in future negotiations, they're just going to be chasing the Delta cost. And I think that conversion of industry rates is something we've talked about as kind of another opportunity as we look at trying to make sure we're all running a better business here, and we're not -- we have the same incentives to make sure that our costs are finding their way into our pricing. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Sure. Now it makes sense. And if I could ask one more, a lot on Delta TechOps. Obviously, a big asset for Delta right now. Anything you could talk about? I think you've previously said GTF shop visits are running at 70 to 80 engines. I don't know if that was only GTF or all engines ramping to potentially 400. Maybe if you could just give us the -- talk about the opportunity longer term with Delta TechOps and what utilization is? Dan Janki : Yes. Talk about it at baseline this year, TechOps for geared turbofan engine overhauls would be in the 150, 160 range. We have built capacity to take that to -- up to 350 and continue to discuss long-term -- medium- and longer-term capacity needs with Pratt related to that. So, we talked about it at Investor Day. Very optimistic about our position, not only the heritage that we have and the great expertise that we have in the Delta TechOps team, but our positioning as it relates to being on all the key next-generation platforms, whether that's geared turbofan, whether that's Rolls and also the LEAP engine create a real set of opportunities for us as we think about this business and multiples of what it can be today over the medium- and long-term. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you so much. Julie Stewart : That will wrap the analyst portion of the call. I'll now turn it over to Tim Mapes to start the media questions. Tim Mapes : Thank you, Julie. Matthew, if we could, as we transition from the analyst questions to those from the members of the media, maybe repeat the instructions for everyone, please. Operator : Certainly. At this time, we'll be conducting a Q&A session for media questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Dawn Gilbertson from Wall Street Journal. Your line is live. Dawn Gilbertson : Hi, good morning. Ed, I wonder if you could give us any more color, Ed or Glen, on the reaction to the SkyMiles changes and when you expect to announce the things you might be rolling back or changing? Ed Bastian : Hi, Dawn. I've mentioned publicly over the last couple of weeks that we're certainly receiving good feedback from our customers with respect to the changes. I have indicated that we had too many changes rolled out at the same time, and we needed to go back and reassess the planned rollout for the new qualification levels. I mentioned this morning on the CNBC interview, there's two things, though, that are common throughout all of the feedback. One is there is the intense loyalty to Delta, which is really heartwarming to see. The loyalty to this brand is great. We've worked hard to build it and we maintain that. We will continue to maintain that. There should be no question about that. And secondly, that most everyone also agrees that something has to be done, because everyone sees that the premium number of customers that we continue to build are in excess of the premium assets that we have to offer. And so figuring out how to better rationalize and make certain that the service levels for our premium customers are where they need to be is -- there's various ways to get it. We've received a lot of ideas as to different ways to think about it, and you'll be hearing from us in the coming days. Dawn Gilbertson : Okay. If I could just have one quick follow-up on that front. What is driving -- in terms of the reaction, I mean, are you seeing just feedback or are you seeing an impact on credit card sign-ups and/or cancellations? I mean, what's driving this pretty quick change to your initial plans? Ed Bastian : Well, it's the feedback. It's not -- no, we're not seeing any change in trajectory rather on acquisitions or changes in spend levels. Everything continues to stay intact, as Glen, I think mentioned during some of his comments. This is good feedback that we're seeing and candidly, with some of it, I agree with them. Dawn Gilbertson : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Alison Sider from Wall Street Journal. Your line is live. Alison Sider : Hey, thanks so much. So, there's been some analysis recently about sort of the potential impact of cost savings if people really started taking weight loss drugs like Ozempic in big numbers. Is that something you look at, at all? Do you factor that into your fuel projections or anything like that? Ed Bastian : No, we don't, Ali. Alison Sider : And then if I could follow up. I was also curious on potential Israel evacuation flights. I know there's ongoing discussions with the government on this. But would Delta be open to flying Israel under a charter if the government asks or if there was a craft activation? Or would you rather just fly to points outside of Israel? Is there any openness, I guess, to flying kind of under those circumstances? Ed Bastian : There are discussions, as I've indicated. Right now, we're looking at providing some additional lift to Europe to get people out of Europe. But no, we don't have any plans to be flying into Israel. It's considered unsafe for a U.S. carrier to operate in that airspace currently. Alison Sider : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News. Your line is live. Mary Schlangenstein : Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask real quickly, with the ongoing slot waiver situation in New York where the airlines were asked to reduce capacity because of the congestion in the air traffic controller shortage, can you talk about how much of that Delta is taking advantage of? And whether you expect that if it continues long term to start to have some significant impact? Also whether you're redeploying that capacity into other markets? Ed Bastian : Well, thanks for that question. Yes, we're planning on using the entirety of the slot waiver which is, I believe, 10% of our flights into and out of Kennedy and LaGuardia in order to help with the airspace congestion issues that are surrounding those airports right now. So, what we're trying to do is have minimal impact. We will not withdraw from any individual markets. We will thin out some frequencies. We'll put some larger gauge in. And any of the assets that are freed up from New York will get redeployed into other parts of our network for now. But it shouldn't really be very different than the summer. As you know, that's rolled forward from the summer, which we had 10% out, and that's just extending it through the winter. So, you won't see really, I think, any dramatic changes to our schedule versus where we're sitting today. Mary Schlangenstein : Does that become a broader problem for you if that continues to be extended? Ed Bastian : I think the broader problem is not being able to operate in the New York airspace. And so I think we're working very closely with the government to see what we can do to improve the situation there. It was very difficult on our customers this summer, and certainly, we're all hoping for some relief by next summer. Peter Carter : And Mary, we really -- this is Peter Carter. We really appreciate the FAA providing that relief and acknowledging that there is a constraint in the northeast with respect to the staffing of air traffic controllers. And frankly, that's the thing that we need to really solve as an industry. Mary Schlangenstein : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Leslie Josephs from CNBC. Your line is live. Leslie Josephs : Hi, good morning. We keep seeing air fares fall, and I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what kind of discounting you're having to do in the fall. And then have you made any capacity changes on days when people might have traveled in the off-peak and maybe they're going back to more traditional bookings, if that's the case? Thanks. Glen Hauenstein : Sure. I think the most recent data that came out this morning had been flat to up slightly month-over-month, so I don't think that as an industry level, that's a good indication. What we've seen is that actually June was our lowest point in terms of year-over-year average fares and it's moved up for us since then. And that's really driven by the premium side and the success we've had in terms of selling more premium and the fares we're getting for our premium products and services. So yes, at the bottom end, there's some discounting. There's also some fare initiatives. So, it's always a very fluid situation. And right now, I think we're very -- we're calling it stable between third quarter and fourth quarter. Leslie Josephs : And the fares that you're discounting to, is that like on par with 2019 or is that -- like is there a kind of a reference point for... Glen Hauenstein : Yeah, certain markets are, certain markets are above. So I think the market basket is there -- at the very bottom end, they may be slightly below where they were in '19, but not really. There's always a fare in a market that is below, but in general, they're not. Leslie Josephs : Thank. Tim Mapes : Thank you, Leslie. Matthew, we have time for one final question, please. Operator : Certainly. Your last question is coming from David Slotnick from TPG. Your line is live. David Slotnick : Good morning, and thank you for taking the question. Coming back to the loyalty program, were you surprised by the customer reaction and I suppose the degree of it? And what were you sort of expecting instead of that effect? Ed Bastian : We were certainly expecting some feedback. And by the way, some of the feedback we've received is very positive and encourages us not to make any changes. So, there wasn't any one cohort that was silent on the matter. We heard all of the -- a full 360 view of the perspective. But it gave us a chance to sit back, reflect on it. And there were points about the program that I thought that we could make some modifications to. There still will be changes to the program. I've been very clear about that, but we're going to make modifications to what we announced. David Slotnick : Thank you. And just a follow-up. Was American Express expecting any changes to the premium card demand just with the lounge access? Do they think that, that's potentially going to fall? And if so, will that impact your loyalty revenue? Glen Hauenstein : American Express, we, of course, did this with full back-and-forth knowledge, so we did this together with American Express. And if anything, since we've announced it, we've seen a shift to higher premium card acquisitions. So, I think we're well within from that perspective where we thought we'd be. David Slotnick : Great. Thank you. Tim Mapes : Thank you, David. And Matthew, I think that will conclude our call. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation today.",

Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta\u2019s SEC filings. We\u2019ll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and all results exclude special items, unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page, ir.delta.com. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ed. Ed Bastian : Well, thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us this morning. Earlier today, we reported our full year and December quarter results, posting fourth quarter earnings of $1.1 billion, or $1.28 per share, on record quarterly revenue that was 11% higher than 2022 and an operating margin of 10%. I want to sincerely thank the 100,000 strong Delta team for their outstanding work in delivering these results and serving our customers. Delta carried more travelers this holiday season than any other time in our history, and we delivered industry-leading operational performance with the number one system completion factor amongst our peer set throughout the December quarter. To put that in context, we carried 9 million customers, a record 9 million customers, I\u2019d add, on 60,000 mainline flights over the holiday period, with fewer than 40 cancellations in aggregate. Our December quarter results marked a strong close to year two of our three-year plan. For the full year, we reported earnings of $6.25 per share, the second highest EPS result in our history on revenue that was 20% higher than the prior year. We delivered an 11.6% operating margin and pre-tax income of $5.2 billion, a near doubling over 2022. We generate free cash flow of $2 billion while investing $5.3 billion back into the business, and we improved our leverage by two full turns and reinstated our quarterly dividend. Return on invested capital was 13.4%, a five-point improvement from 2022, a tremendous amount of progress, especially if you consider where we sat the short three years ago, and I\u2019m so proud of our team across the board. Sharing our financial success is a long-standing pillar of Delta\u2019s culture, and I\u2019m thrilled to announce that we\u2019ll be rewarding our employees with $1.4 billion in well-earned profit sharing on Valentine\u2019s Day. For our employees, the estimated payout will be approximately 10% of eligible 2023 compensation, about double of what last year\u2019s payment was. I expect our profit sharing payments will be more than our three largest competitors combined.  Our people consistently deliver operational excellence with a relentless focus on raising the bar at every stage of the travel journey to deliver safe, reliable, and caring service for our customers. They are the reason our brand and our customer loyalty lead the industry, why Delta was recognized as the world\u2019s 12th most admired company by Fortune, and why Glassdoor named us yesterday as the 13th best employer in the country. In 2023, we made meaningful investments in our people, our operation, and our customers. We provided well-deserved pay increases for the Delta team, continuing our philosophy of industry-leading pay for industry-leading performance. In the operation, the investments that we made supported the best-in-class operational performance that Delta has long been known for. Our operational excellence was recognized by Cirium last week, which named us, yet again, the most on-time airline in North America. Our people and our operational reliability are the foundation of Delta\u2019s trusted consumer brand, and we are building on that foundation as we elevate the premium flying experience and grow our SkyMiles members\u2019 engagement with Delta. Today, we also announced an order for 20 Airbus 350-1000 aircraft, with options for 20 more, for delivery starting in 2026. These planes complement our fleet strategy and will offer a world-class customer experience for international travelers with more premium seats, higher gauge, and great customer amenities. These aircraft are over 20% more fuel-efficient than the 767s that they\u2019ll be replacing, further supporting our long-term sustainability goals. And with the successful launch of fast, free Wi-Fi and Delta Sync, we are enhancing the in-flight entertainment experience for SkyMiles members. We expect to have these products rolled out globally by the end of this year. On the ground, we are building the airports of the future in some of the most important markets and adding new Delta Sky Clubs to provide our customers a world-class airport experience. We completed our transformation at Los Angeles 18 months ahead of schedule, including a state-of-the-art facility and a new Delta Sky Club that was named North America\u2019s Best Airline Lounge for 2023 by Business Traveler. We opened the latest phase of our Salt Lake City expansion, and we\u2019ll complete the generational rebuild of LaGuardia this year. Our digital investments continue as we work to increase our agility and provide employees with better tools and customers with a more seamless experience. Customers visited the Fly Delta app over 1 billion times last year, using our self-service tools almost 10x more often than 2019, with much higher overall satisfaction. As 2024 begins, our enterprise has moved from a period of restoration to optimization. We are focused on delivering excellent reliability, elevating the customer experience, and improving efficiency across the company to support continued growth in our earnings and our cash flow. We expect demand to remain strong, particularly for the premium experiences that Delta provides. Consumer spend is continuing to shift from goods to services, and our customer base is in a healthy financial position with travel remaining a top priority. And corporate travel continues to improve with demand accelerating into year-end. On supply, industry growth is normalizing after several years of network restoration. For 2024, we plan to grow Delta\u2019s capacity 3% to 5% below the mid-single-digit range that we discussed at our June Investor Day as we\u2019ve refined our plan. Domestically, supply and demand are coming into better balance as the industry adjusts to rising costs of production, and we are seeing a positive inflection in domestic unit revenue growth. Internationally, we expect another strong year as we optimize our network and leverage our global JV partners. With that backdrop, we are providing full-year 2024 guidance for earnings of $6 to $7 per share and free cash flow of $3 billion to $4 billion. Free cash guidance is up to $2 billion higher than 2023, driven by growth and profitability, lower CapEx, and an improved mix of cash sales. As we continue to grow earnings and reduce debt, we will further reduce leverage and advance our balance sheet towards investment grade metrics. Glen and Dan will provide more details shortly, including our outlook for the March quarter.  In closing, the people of Delta delivered a remarkable 2023, leading the industry operationally and financially while providing a world-class experience for our customers. Delta is well-positioned to build on our momentum in the new year with continued growth in earnings and cash flow in 2024. I could not be more excited about what\u2019s ahead for Delta and our customers, and I am confident that our returns-focused strategy will drive significant value creation for our owners in the years to come. Thank you again for the support you show to our company, and with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Glen. Glen Hauenstein : Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by thanking all of our employees for their hard work and dedication this year. For the full year, we delivered record revenues of $55 billion, about 20% higher than pre-pandemic. Strong execution on our commercial strategy resulted in significant outperformance against the industry with international delivering record margins and profits. We finished the year with unit revenues 3% higher than 2022, also about 20% above pre-pandemic levels. Diversified revenue streams, including premium and loyalty, generated 55% of revenue, reflecting Delta\u2019s differentiated strategy. Premium led all year with record paid load factors and yield growth outpacing Main Cabin. The rollout of Delta Premium Select on long-haul international is nearly complete and the revenue generation has been above our expectations. As we continue to increase our premium seat mix and segment the cabin through our five product strategy, we have structurally improved the international margins. Our loyalty program continued to exceed our expectations with record SkyMiles acquisitions in 2023. Total loyalty revenue was up 19% over the prior year with 15% growth in co-brand spend and increasing mix of premium cards in our Amex co-brand portfolio. In recognition of our commitment to the Business Traveler, Delta was named number one in Business Travel News Airline survey for an unprecedented 13th consecutive year. Delta gained corporate share during the year and successfully launched SkyMiles for business, providing small to medium sized companies new benefits to support further growth in the important SME segment. Corporate sales accelerated into year end, including double-digit year-over-year growth in the month of December. Technology and Financial Services led this momentum for the December quarter with Media and Auto sectors seeing notable traction following the strike resolutions. December quarter revenue was a record $13.7 billion, 11% higher than 2022. While unit revenues were 3% lower than last year, we are entering the year with momentum in our highest and had experienced our highest cash sales day in history this week. We expect March quarter revenue growth of 3% to 6% over 2023 on capacity growth of 6%, which includes one point from leap day, implying unit revenues will be flat to down 3% over last year. This is a two point sequential improvement on a year-over-year basis from the December quarter. Our March quarter faces headwinds from three dynamics when compared to last year. These include higher international mix, the normalization of travel credit utilization and lapping a competitor\u2019s operational challenges. Looking through these headwinds, the core fundamentals of the business are improving faster than the headline numbers suggest. With encouraging developments in the domestic environment, we expect domestic unit revenues to inflect to positive in the March quarter. The Transatlantic, our largest international entity, continues to perform well with strong demand through the shoulder period, and we expect unit revenues to grow in the March quarter. In Latin and Pacific, we are rebuilding our networks and improving connectivity with our JV partners, accounting for the majority of capacity growth in the March quarter. These investments are supporting higher short-term profitability, but with lower unit revenues. Turning to our outlook for the full year, premium consumer trends remain strong, and spending on travel experiences continues to outpace overall GDP by 2 to 3 points. We expect solid growth in business demand with nearly 95% of respondents in our recent corporate survey expecting to travel as much or more in 1Q than 4Q. This is a double digit improvement in travel intentions from our last survey. Our commercial strategy in 2024 builds on Delta\u2019s competitive advantages by optimizing our network, growing high margin revenue streams and investing in our future. First, we have a unique opportunity to further optimize Delta\u2019s network to capitalize on our strengths in core hubs and JV partner hubs and reflect evolving travel trends. This is the first time we\u2019ve been able to optimize since pre-pandemic, as we now have a good set of demand to optimize from. Second, growing revenue diversification through high margin sources remains an important differentiator for Delta. We have runway ahead as we continue adding more premium seats to our aircraft, further improve our retail capabilities and expand loyalty revenues and travel adjacent services. We expect American Express remuneration to grow 10% over 2023 levels. Finally, we are investing in the future to enhance the premium travel experience through our next-gen fleet, generational airport builds and digital transformation. With continued investment, Delta\u2019s brand strength and leadership position will extend in the years ahead. In closing, I\u2019m incredibly proud of the team\u2019s performance in 2023 and we\u2019re entering the new year with momentum. I am excited about Delta\u2019s opportunities to grow our lead in 2024. And with that I\u2019ll turn it over to Dan to talk about the financials. Dan Janki : Thank you, Glen. And good morning to everyone. 2023 was another meaningful milestone in restoring our financial foundation. We delivered earnings of $6.25 per share and pretax income of $5.2 billion, nearly double our performance of last year. Operating margins of 11.6% was up four points from last year and expected to lead the industry. We generated operating cash flow of $7.2 billion, enabling reinvestment in our people, our fleet and technology. After gross CapEx of $5.3 billion, we generated free cash flow of $2 billion. During the year, we paid more than $4 billion of gross debt. This included accelerated repayment of $1.7 billion of higher cost debt. We ended the year with liquidity of $6.8 billion and grew our unencumbered assets to $26 billion. Our leverage ratio improved two turns to finish the year at three times. Return on invested capital improved to 13.4%, up five points over 2022. S&P upgraded our credit rating in the second half of last year. We are investment grade rated at Moody\u2019s and we are now only one notch away from investment grade with outlooks improving at both S&P and Fitch during the year. With this progress, we reinstated our dividend last summer, broadening our appeal to yield focused investors. We closed out the year strong, reporting a December quarter pretax profit of $1.1 billion, on operating margins of 9.7%, resulting in earnings of $2.28 per share. Non-fuel unit costs were up 1.1% year-over-year in line with our guidance. Now moving to our outlook, for the March quarter, we expect earnings of $0.25 to $0.50 per share on approximately 5% operating margin. We expect March quarter fuel price to be $2.50 to $2.70 per gallon, with a $0.05 to $0.10 refinery benefit. The refinery profit is expected to be down more than $130 million from last year due to elevated crack spreads in early 2023. For the full year, we expect to deliver earnings of $6 to $7 per share. With our reduced outlook for capacity growth, we expect full year non-fuel unit costs to be up low single digit over 2023, with the March quarter unit costs up approximately 3%. The last two years were a period of intense restoration with unnatural high growth to rebuild our network. Growth is normalizing and we\u2019ve entered a period of optimization with a focus on restoring our most profitable core hubs and delivering efficiency gains across the enterprise. The intensity of hiring and training has moderated and investments in reliability are beginning to pay off with continued improvement in operational performance. We expect to deliver efficiencies through the year that will help fund investments in our people, the customer experiences that Ed spoke to earlier. On maintenance we have a higher number of heavy airframe and engine checks this year resulting from the timing of new aircraft deliveries over the last decade and the reactivation of our flex fleets. At the same time, industry-wide supply chain constraints are continuing, driving higher costs and extended turnaround times. For the full year, we expect maintenance expense to be up $350 million over 2023, as we prioritize continued improvement in operational reliability and readying our fleet for the peak summer period. We expect the majority of this increase to be in the early part of the year. Unit cost growth is expected to improve for the March quarter levels as we deliver efficiency and lap investments we made in the second half of 2023. Now, onto cash flow. We expect cash flow of $3 billion to $4 billion of free cash flow, including CapEx of $5 billion. The improvement in free cash flow is driven by growth and profitability, lower CapEx and a higher mix of cash sales. As cash sales are expected to compose a larger percentage of overall bookings as travel credit utilization normalizes. We plan to pay cash for $3 billion of 2024 debt maturities and for approximately 45 aircraft deliveries, growing our unencumbered asset base to $30 billion. We expect to reduce leverage to under three times, returning the balance sheet to investment grade metrics, while continued invest in the business remains our focus for capital allocation, we\u2019ll continue to evaluate shareholder returns with a focus on dividend growth as we reach our targeted leverage. In closing, Delta is well positioned as we enter the final year of our three-year plan to restore our financial foundation. We are continuing to prioritize the objectives we laid out at Investor Day with an emphasis on earnings durability, free cash flow and capital efficiency. Our industry-leading operational and financial performance is a result of the hard work and dedication of the Delta people. I\u2019d like to thank each of them for what they do every day. With that, I\u2019d like to turn it back to Julie for Q&A. Julie Stewart : Thanks, Dan. Matthew, can you please remind the analysts how to queue up for questions? Operator : Certainly. At this time we\u2019ll be conducting the analyst question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live. Michael Linenberg : Oh, hey, good morning, everyone. This is a question probably to both Dan and Glen. With the new A350-1000s coming in 2026, and knowing that you do have some additional Airbus widebodies delivering over the next few years, are you still going to be in a situation where maybe you have to extend your 767 fleet? I know that is to be fully retired. I think it was going to be by 2025. Will you have enough lift? And if not, are we going to see additional investments into maybe some of these older aircraft to keep them running through until you take deliveries of the bigger airplanes? Glen Hauenstein : As we move through 2025, 2024 through the back half of the decade, we expect to retire the 767-300s through that period of time on a pretty consistent basis as you step through while continuing to fly the 400s. Michael Linenberg : So you\u2019ll continue to fly the 400s beyond 2025, Dan? Glen Hauenstein : Yes. Dan Janki : Mike, I don\u2019t think\u2026 Glen Hauenstein : [Indiscernible] in 2025. Dan Janki : It was never our intent to have that fleet grounded by 2025. It was our intent to have them out of international long haul by 2028 and retired by 2030. Glen Hauenstein : 2030, yes. Michael Linenberg : Okay. Okay, makes sense. They\u2019re a bit younger. And then, Glen, just my second question, what was the headwind due to the cancellation of the Israel services in \u2013 the Israel services in the fourth quarter? And is that a good way to think about the March quarter impact if you don\u2019t restart those services by the 31st? Thanks. Glen Hauenstein : So, Mike, the initial hit was clearly the greatest because as we moved through the quarter, we redeployed the assets to other markets. So, I would say it was about a point of revenue in 4Q, and that really goes to very little impact in 1Q and beyond. And, of course, we\u2019re assessing the issues in Israel. Our current intent we have loaded for sale April, we\u2019ll see how that manifests as we move through. But our priority is always safety first, safety of our customers and our crews, and that\u2019s going to be our priority. Michael Linenberg : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Helane Becker from TD Cowen. Your line is live. Helane Becker : Thanks very much, operator. Hi, team. Thanks for the time. So, two questions. One for, I think, Ed, you mentioned this morning on CNBC that you were seeing improvement in corporate, especially in the tech sector. So I\u2019m kind of wondering if you or Glen can talk about what you\u2019re seeing in corporate by sector and maybe by geographic region. Ed Bastian : Well, I\u2019ll start and Glen can add his color as well. We are seeing continued improvement in the corporate sector, and we had a number of laggards, tech being by far the largest in terms of that had essentially not returned to travel. And we\u2019re finally starting to see tech companies traveling again and again I think a lot of it is the return to office that is driving some of that. The consultancies as well, which have also been laggards again, given their clients have had their offices somewhat reduced, office hours opening is helping there, and we\u2019ve seen it across the board. The other thing I mentioned this morning also is the auto and entertainment sectors have rebounded nicely. Entertainment clearly and the auto is starting to rebound following the strikes in the fourth quarter. Helane Becker : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. And then just for my follow-up question, as you think about International, I noticed that in your schedules, you\u2019re elongating the season with maybe just January and February in International being seasonally lower. Are you seeing travel move into those months as well so that you would extend or add especially to your coastal hubs, more international service going east? Ed Bastian : Absolutely. I think we\u2019ve disclosed this previously, is that we\u2019ve seen the seasons elongate for leisure travel to Europe really March through October now is pretty strong. Of course, the shoulder is still not as strong as the peak summer. But in response to that, and again, this is part of our optimization of how we fly is tailoring our capacity to when demand actually exists. Helane Becker : Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks, team. Have a nice day. Ed Bastian : Thank you. Dan Janki : Thank you. Helane Becker : Of course. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Your line is live. Jamie Baker : Good morning, everybody. Glen, on the pending inflection in domestic RASM, I appreciate we\u2019re seeing capacity plans tighten up across the industry. My question is whether you\u2019re seeing any revisions in how the growth year airlines are behaving outside of nearly cutting capacity. Anything else interesting we should be focused on, or is it simply a supply exercise that\u2019s driving the improvement? Glen Hauenstein : Well, I think Jamie, you\u2019ve got a couple of contributors to it. One is what Ed just mentioned, the improving conditions in the corporate environment. And it\u2019s been a slow and steady rebuild since the end of the pandemic. But we are at post-pandemic highs somewhere right around 90% restored to pre-pandemic levels as we head into this year. So that I think is an exciting backdrop for a domestic turnaround. Of course, we have some of the rationalization of capacity, but we also have continued improvements in segmentation and pricing. I can\u2019t talk to our competitors. I just know how we are working now. And 20 years ago, we were only compare \u2013 only worried about the lowest fares in the market, and now we\u2019re worried about the entire ladder and the relativity within those ladders and trying to get people to experience the higher quality products. And I think that\u2019s really led to our ability to continue to segment the customers in a more enlightened way moving forward. And that\u2019s going to be one of the key drivers as we head through this year. Jamie Baker : Okay. I appreciate that. And then a second question for Ed, during your interview with Phil this morning, you mentioned you\u2019re still holding out hope for the $7 earnings outcome this year. If we fast forward to a year from today, give or take, and that indeed has been the outcome, what do you think the primary driver will have been? I guess the better way to ask is, do you think there\u2019s upside based on what Delta can control, or do you think it\u2019ll simply be exogenous factors like, hey, fuel cooperated, or, I don\u2019t know, maybe the consumer leaned even further into premium, that that sort of thing? Ed Bastian : Sure. Thanks, Jamie. I get the question. I think the level of volatility that we see is what causes us to be a bit cautious and prudent in giving that $6 to $7 EPS guide in 2024. We\u2019ve been signaling that a bit for the last six months, and that\u2019s where we sit today. I have great confidence in us hitting that guide, which is what I think the Street wants to know, where our confidence level is. There are a bunch of macros that we look at into the year, which we\u2019ll have to see how they play out. Clearly, the geopolitical front continues to be quite testy, including the fact that this is a political election season, not just in the U.S., but around the world. Energy prices, we saw this morning just how volatile energy prices are. And to me, the supply chain both the cost and the constraints that we see in this industry continue unabated. We\u2019re not making nearly the progress on the supply chain improvements if anything. Every news we get seems to be a bit worse, not better. So that constrains growth and increased cost. That all said, my internal stretch for myself and our team is to still get to that $7 number this year. I think we have a possibility to get there, but I also think that the macro weighs on that assessment. And I think to be prudent, we should set expectations maybe a little bit lower and hope to overachieve just by the way we did in 2023. We gave a $5 to $6 guide and came in on the top end. And I\u2019d like to see a year from now that we\u2019re reporting that same type of result. Jamie Baker : Glen and Ed, thank you very much for taking my questions. Take care. Ed Bastian : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Your line is live. Conor Cunningham : Everyone, thank you. Just on the regions in general, you obviously sound more constructive domestically, but I think you mentioned that you still see a fair bit of upside in terms of international. If you could just level set on your overall like regional expectations in 2024, I think that would be helpful. Thank you. Ed Bastian : Well, I think we\u2019re expecting domestic to continue to improve, the comps gets easier as we move through the year. So we should see some nice momentum there. We had a fantastic year in the Transatlantic. We\u2019re hoping to beat that, but there\u2019s a really high bar as we move through the year. What we have on the books today is really pretty exciting for the month of April, where we have about 40% of our Transatlantic bookings in place. We have unit revenue sitting at high-single digits up, which I think most people wouldn\u2019t expect. Of course, we have a lot of booking to go there, but the early returns for spring and summer are very favorable as we sit today. Pacific, where we have an incredible amount of capacity, it\u2019s being absorbed nicely, and we expect that to inflect into a positive territory as those growth rates come down, we move through the year. And last but not least, Latin, and our ambitious build of South America with our partners LATAM is paying very good strong dividends. We\u2019re improving our profitability, albeit, at lower unit revenue. So I think we\u2019re very excited about where South America sits. And the beaches this winter seem a little oversaturated that will rationalize itself out as we move through the year. Conor Cunningham : Appreciate that. And then Dan, on 2024 costs, I was hoping if you could provide some thought just on the shape of the cost trajectory. It seems like a lot of it just has to do with timing of maintenance and really, really that type of stuff. So just any color, additional color there could be helpful. Thank you. Dan Janki : Yes. As said maintenance was up $350 million for the year with a focus on the first part of the year. The other piece of it is you think about efficiencies, efficiencies just build as you progress through the year. One example is we\u2019re down on \u2013 we\u2019re fully staffed. One place we\u2019re hiring is pilots that will be down 50% \u2013 over 50% from last year, but again, front half centric with training associated with it as you get ready for the summer. And that really normalizes the historical levels in the back half of the year. So just a good steady drum beat of efficiencies as we pace through the year. Conor Cunningham : Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Stephen Trent from Citi. Your line is live. Stephen Trent : Good morning, everybody, and thanks very much for taking my question. This might be for Ed or Glen, but you addressed it a little bit in an earlier response. But how deep do you think this supply chain stuff goes? First, we have the GTF engine, now the MAX 9 door plug. Do you think we\u2019ve kind of reached the bottom, or are you concerned there could be more to come 6 months to 12 months from now? Ed Bastian : Thanks, Stephen. This is Ed. I hope there\u2019s no more surprises, but I\u2019d be lying to you if I thought that\u2019s the case. I mean I think we\u2019re continuing to work through the \u2013 in this post-pandemic world, the implications of the supply chain issues that we saw. And while the MAX 9 issue is a one off, separate issue, I\u2019m not referring to that. I am referring principally to the engine side of the business. And there\u2019s a lot of work on Pratt. We have a lot of reliance on Pratt. And their challenges that they\u2019re facing have been well chronicled. One of the things that we see on the engine side is as a lot of the incremental resources that our engine providers and suppliers have put their resources against it also strips away resources from maintenance work on their existing business with us. So we\u2019re working through as efficient a manner with Pratt. They were in this week and spent a lot of time with them. Roles and gee, everybody in the engine world has challenges, not just on the original build, but more importantly on the parts and the repair side of the business. And a lot of it\u2019s an experience factor level. All the suppliers in our industry lost a tremendous amount of experience due to the pandemic. And it\u2019s taking time to get that back, to get the turn times, down to where they need to be. And when you have higher turn times, that not only delays the entry into service, it also causes costs to go up. Stephen Trent : I appreciate that, Ed. Thank you. And as my follow-up, I appreciate as well what you mentioned on the Latin market doing well. Any high level color respect to \u2013 with respect to sort of deep LATAM versus short haul LATAM. I mean I presume a lot of the uplift you\u2019re seeing is from the JBA spooling up, but just wanted to make sure I understood that correctly. Thank you. Glen Hauenstein : Yes. I think you described it perfectly. There\u2019s a little pressure on the short haul LATAM, particularly on the resorts, where a lot of capacity was added by the industry year-over-year. But we\u2019re having really incredible performance into deep South America as we continue our coordination of launching the JV with LATAM. And we\u2019re very excited about the short-term and the long-term prospects there. Stephen Trent : Great. I appreciate that, Glen, and thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from David Vernon from Bernstein. Your line is live. David Vernon : Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. So Dan, as you think about what happened in 2023, as far as kind of the cost creep that led us to a little bit of a higher cost position than maybe you would have thought in the beginning of the year. Can you give us a kind of rundown around kind of what you missed in 2023? And then with that as kind of a backdrop, talk to some of the sources of risk that you might see for that most single-digit outlook for CASM, MAX in 2024. Dan Janki : Yes, predominantly, yes, David, certainly, two drivers. First, we flew less capacity and kept the cost into invest back into the business. That was one. And the second piece was what we talked a lot in the second half of the year was the investment in maintenance and the cost associated with maintenance. And those were really, when you look at where we were, from what we got it to where we ended up just over plus two, those were the single two biggest drivers associated with that. When you think about that as we go into New Year, four here, a lot different backdrop as we\u2019re in a more normalized growth environment. When you\u2019re thinking and planning and the teams are executing the 3% to 5% growth versus 17% to 20% growth, the focus really less on this training and hiring and the restoration of the airline and our operating teams are focused on the operational performance and fine tuning that. And as you do that, that sets the stage to drive the efficiency. And things that we actions that we took in if we are paying off, if you look at the maintenance doing a lot of work and there\u2019s a lot to still go. But the fourth quarter performance aircraft out of service down 30%, maintenance cancels down over 80%. So that those actions that they\u2019re taking around, proactive reliability, getting the touch time on the aircraft, paying dividends, but that\u2019s really what allows us when you\u2019re in that normalized environment, you can really stay after that consistently day in and day out. That sets the stage for the execution around efficiency. Ed Bastian : David, if I could jump in here, it\u2019s hard to overstate just how hard it was to bring the full business back up again over the last 2.5 years. And the intensity of that has been phenomenal. And our team\u2019s done a great job, but it\u2019s taken every fiber of our being and hiring and resource we have to try to get ahead of it. We\u2019re there now. Okay. And you see the results in the fourth quarter, they were remarkable. The best fourth quarter operational results I think this company has ever posted. And that is, I think, the big opportunity as we enter the year. I don\u2019t know that we know yet just how much we have available to us as we start to return to a normalized environment and start tweaking those efficiencies. I think it\u2019s going to be significant. And it\u2019s kind of hard to forecast, because this team has been for the last two plus years in a very different part of the build, but I\u2019m confident we\u2019re going to see some great opportunities. And that\u2019s to Jamie\u2019s earlier question, some of my internal expectations of hoping that we can get through that $7 above EPS number. I\u2019m willing to put that number on paper quite yet, but I think the opportunity is there. David Vernon : Thanks for that added color. Just to maybe kind of follow-up on that point a little bit, as you think about the optimization efficiency gains that are ahead of you. I appreciate that it\u2019s hard to quantify it all, but can you give us a sense for what the driver of some of these things are kind of big picture wise? Is it about utilization of aircraft? Is it about getting the staffing optimized? Or is it more about just working some of the friction costs in the business out and sort of continuously improving, chasing down a bunch of little dogs and cats across the business? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for kind of what are we looking at here? Are we looking at a large set of projects or are there one or two things that are going to be super pivotal around the optimization side of this? Ed Bastian : David, I think it\u2019s all the above. And it\u2019s not just what you mentioned on the cost side, it\u2019s also on the revenue side. Consumer behaviors have changed a lot. And to this point, we\u2019ve been using somewhat older models to predict behavioral patterns. And we now have actually a good baseline over the last year and a half of what \u2013 how consumers are purchasing, what they\u2019re purchasing, when they want to travel, which Glen and his team will use to drive better network and revenue outcomes for our business. It\u2019s in the cost line. The fact that we have 10% more employees today than we had at this point, pre-pandemic, essentially driving the same level of operations, tremendous amount of opportunity to get efficient. But when the operators know what they can count on and they\u2019ve got their arms around the full operation, I think you\u2019re going to see the cash register start to ring with cost and savings efficiency. So I know it\u2019s a bet on the come a little bit, but I\u2019m optimistic we\u2019ll get there. But it\u2019s really hard to quantify at the same time. David Vernon : Excellent. Thanks a lot for the added color. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning and happy New Year, everyone. I know your commentary on demand sounds pretty good, but can you unpack a little bit more detail on what you\u2019re seeing in the forward booking curve through spring break and maybe even the activity through the Paris Olympics over the summer? What kind of forward indicator do you have that people might be traveling more? Ed Bastian : Well, I think I mentioned it as a response to one of the other questions, but we have pretty good visibility on the early bookings for the summer Transatlantic season, and we have a higher booked load factor as well as higher yield. So those are the two things you watch for and both are indicating quite positive for the Transatlantic. The U.S. has, of course, a closer in booking curve, but as far as we can see out through a spring break, things look great for the U.S. And as I mentioned earlier, some of the close in beach resorts have a little bit too much industry capacity this year. That\u2019ll probably get rationalized out over time, but still will be very profitable as we move through the peak winter season. And then as Pacific rush, as we continue to lap the buildup of our Pacific as we move through the year, we expect those unit revenues to accelerate demand, particularly strong to the [indiscernible] as well as to Japan in the spring season. So very exciting. As we look forward, I hope we can outdo our plan. Ravi Shanker : Got it. And apologies if I missed this earlier, but do you \u2013 I mean, some of your peers are having issues with the potential extended grounding of some aircraft for inspections. Do you see any kind of spillover benefit for that in the short-term? And kind of \u2013 is any of that in your 1Q guidance? Ed Bastian : Yes. We\u2019ve seen minimal improvements and what we have seen is mostly in Seattle, where they\u2019ve had to cancel a significant portion of their schedule out of Seattle, but we\u2019ll see how long that stays out. But right now, I wouldn\u2019t say, it\u2019s a significant number in the grander scheme of things. It\u2019s significant for Seattle, but not significant for our whole network. Ravi Shanker : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is live. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey, good morning. Maybe just on the cadence of the non-op savings and the component drivers of that. Is it spread pretty evenly throughout the year or is it more kind of second half weighted? Dan Janki : Yes. The driver is $75 million to $100 million, really driven by interest expense. And as we\u2019ve accelerated the debt reduction action that drives the benefit, we expect pension to be flat on a year-over-year basis. The team did a great job. The pension delivered at or slightly above its targeted return, so no headwind associated with that. You get some \u2013 a little bit around some of the equity earnings of our partners, but we expect to be pretty consistent throughout the year due to the interest reduction and savings coming through as you progress through the year. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thanks. And then just a follow-up for Glen. You\u2019ve done a nice job taking some active steps to \u2013 on the capacity sequentially 4Q to 1Q. But could you just speak to seasonality and maybe by entity? Where is seasonality a lot different than it used to be? Where is it kind of normalized? So any sort of key trends you\u2019d highlight in change in the underlying seasonal patterns here into the first quarter? Glen Hauenstein : Yes. I think we\u2019re at our new norm, and our new norm is different than 2019,but what I see mainly is an extension of the international seasons. So we mentioned that in an earlier question that it used to be the summer peak was just June, July, August, and now I think we\u2019re moving into April through March. All the way through October is a very strong season, particularly for southern Europe. Northern Europe starts a little bit later. And then the other thing I just mentioned, I mentioned in an earlier call as well, is that the beach Mexican and the Caribbean beaches just seem to have a little bit too much capacity this year, and we\u2019ll work through that as we go through the year. But if you look, those are up 20%, 30% across the board and having a little trouble keeping up with that \u2013 the demand keeping up with that kind of capacity increase. And I imagine, it is \u2013 people plan next year that they\u2019ll trim on the margin those back down again or let that demand catch up. So generally, I think we\u2019re in a good spot here with supply and demand as far as the I can see, we\u2019re positive in all the future months and almost all the future \u2013 in almost every entity with the exception of lab. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thank you Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is live. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. I guess, Ed or Dan, I mean, looking back from your prior 2021 targets, you guys are guiding at the top end here to effectively reach that. And I think not a lot of people gave you credit. So that\u2019s the context of my question. But that said, valuation in your stock is still pretty low. I think investors are just concerned that we\u2019ve seen peak airline profitability, and your guidance would effectively say about flat profitability this year in 2024 versus 2023. So maybe coming back to some of these prior questions, what is in your control that can get profitability higher? Maybe looking beyond this year, that can give investors comfort that this business should be earning mid-teens. Ed Bastian : Thanks, Brandon. And you\u2019re right. When you think about when we set that target, it was in December of 2021. I\u2019ll never forget we were at the exchange. I believe you were there, and Omicron was just being announced as the newest variant. So the level of knowledge that we had to the future and where this thing was going, it was candidly, kind of maybe a bit crazy for us to put out a three year plan. But I thought it was really important and instructive for us as well as our investors to let them see how we\u2019re thinking about the progress. And the great news is, through the first two years, we are at, if not ahead of plan along the headway. And I think if I was to go back and say what has changed, that maybe has given me a little bit of pause for seven, not longer term, but just in the short-term, I think it\u2019s the higher cost of labor certainly was not known back then. The higher inflation rates were not known back then. And most importantly, the supply chain constraints, the full extent, were not clearly not known, have no knowledge of the challenges we face. So when you think about all the macros we encountered, I think we\u2019ve done a very good job of controlling those things that we can control. And as you\u2019ve heard from several of the questions, I still internally am targeting us to get to that $7 number this year. And I think we can, I really do. But I think it\u2019s also prudent that we give a nod to some of those macros that we\u2019re facing. I think the optimization opportunities, as I mentioned, are significant, and they run across every single part of this business. And all of our leaders are working hard to ensure that we\u2019re delivering an excellent quality product which unleashes that optimization benefits. I think the work that we\u2019re doing on the balance sheet with all the debt reduction is derisking and taking that down is important. We\u2019re on track with our free cash flow guidance, $3 billion to $4 billion this year, and we\u2019re still looking at a $10 billion target between 2023 and 2025 for free cash. So I think you\u2019re right, there\u2019s a lot of noise that, \u201cwe were lower inguidance\u201d. I don\u2019t really look at it that way. I just think it\u2019s giving nod to some of the macro realities and wanted to give you a prudent estimate to what we are confident we can deliver this year with a nod towards there\u2019s some real upside here. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you for that, Ed. And then, Dan, the maintenance issues have been present now for probably over a year, if not longer, I guess, what are you doing longer term planning to maybe mitigate that? And is there any favorable offset longer term here in your MRO business? Thank you. Dan Janki : The \u2013 one is, we continue as we get into a period here where we\u2019re more normalized in growth. It\u2019s allowing us to extend our planning horizon, where we\u2019re able to look out on a rolling not only 12, but 18, 24, 36 months. And I think the more visibility and stability that we get from that allows us to better plan as it relates back into how we run our fleet and how we balance that capacity with cost. And I think that will continue to give us more certainty around that. The other piece is just the heavy lift that our entire tech ops team has in working closely with the supply chain, and with all our partners across that getting clarity in regards to the things that they need to do and we can do on their behalf as it relates to Delta, in regards to continuing to improve the execution of that over time. And we\u2019ve got to work closely with those partners to continue to improve that. And then to the last piece on MRO, yes, there will be an opportunity to continue to grow. I think as we\u2019ve talked about before, we\u2019re well positioned on all these platforms. The focus has been, and we\u2019ll be right here making sure that we\u2019ve got strong foundation on Delta and Delta\u2019s fleet. But we also do have an eye to continue to grow the MRO business, and you\u2019ll start to see that. Start this year but really in earnest in the years two and three years out. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Andrew Didora from Bank of America. Your line is live. Andrew Didora : Hi. Good morning, everyone. So, question for Glen. I think you started ramping up your core hub growth in the middle of 2023. Is there any way you can quantify what the benefits of this build out were to your revenue performance over the back half? And what share of your capacity growth this year will be growth in these hubs? Glen Hauenstein : Yeah. I think we just alluded to a majority of our growth will be in our core hubs or to partner hubs. So probably 75% to 80% of our growth will be in those locations. We feel that we accelerated the coastal gateway growth earlier in the process with our once-in-a-lifetime opportunities to become the leading carriers in markets like Los Angeles and Boston. And those are paying huge dividends for us as we head into 2024, with Boston, for example, leading the unit revenue ascension for this quarter. So we\u2019re really, really pleased with the way it shaked out. And we still have some more rebuild to do in our core hubs. It\u2019ll probably take us through this year and into next year given the lower growth rates that we have, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on for the next 18 to 24 months. Andrew Didora : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just Dan, in the $3 billion to $4 billion of free cash flow, are you assuming any sort of cash taxes this year or when do you expect to become a cash taxpayer? I thought it was a number of years out, but just curious if there\u2019s any update there? Thank you. Dan Janki : No. We don\u2019t expect cash taxes this year and would expect that potentially cash tax payments starting in 2025 and beyond. Andrew Didora : Thank you. Julie Stewart : Matthew, we\u2019ll now go to our final analyst question before then going over to the media. Operator : Certainly. Your next question is coming from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is live. Savi Syth : Hey, good morning, everyone. Maybe a quick one for me; just, you talked about pilot hiring being down 50% year-over-year, and you\u2019ve heard similar comments from the industry. Just curious what that means for your kind of regional operation? And if there was much of a drag in 2023, either to cost or to revenue from that operation and what you can expect this year and next year? Ed Bastian : So thanks for that question, and I think that plays well into some of the other themes that we\u2019ve talked about. Or what are the potential upsides to our plan that could get you towards the $7. We have planned for stability in the regionals after 2.5 years of really instability, where we didn\u2019t know how many hours we had really three to four months ahead of time. And what we\u2019ve seen is that there is a lot more stability. What we haven\u2019t accounted for is the full utilization of our fleet. So we still have 50 to 100 airplanes and less of utilization than we have on the ground in our fleet. So should that lower hiring at the main line translate into more availability in the back half of the year? That would be potential upside to our P&L. Savi Syth : Perfect. All right. Thank you. Julie Stewart : All right. That will wrap up the analyst portion of the call. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Tim Mapes to start the media questions. Tim Mapes : Thank you, Julie. Matthew, if we could reiterate for the members of the media the instructions with regard to accessing the call and follow ups, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Ted Reed from Forbes. Your line is live. Ted Reed : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. It\u2019s for Glen. I just wondered if the Delta passenger in 2024 looks different than the passenger in 2023. And I\u2019m also asking whether the age of revenge travel is over and are we past revenge travel? Thank you. Glen Hauenstein : Well, I mean, this is all an opinion, right, as that, revenge travel, I think has years to go, particularly in long haul international. When you look at the aging of the demographics that people in their retirement years want to travel, and they were robbed of the ability to travel for three years, and we weren\u2019t able to accommodate last year. I think as we continued accommodation of that for the next several years until that revenge travel catch up. I think domestically we\u2019ve done that. Revenge travel was early in the process, and we\u2019re kind of at our new equilibrium, and that gives us the opportunity to optimize as we move forward. And do they look different? They always look different. Ted Reed : As for destinations are we more in unique \u2013 is it more unique transatlantic that they\u2019re looking at or more the traditional transatlantic or something else? Glen Hauenstein : I think it\u2019s more the traditional Italy, Spain; those are two of the Italy, Spain, Greece are such hot spots. Portugal is a hot spot, and I think during the peak summer we\u2019re really excited about the prospect of bringing SAS along with us and now having hubs in Copenhagen and Stockholm that will allow us to have even more destinations in Europe than we serve today. Ted Reed : All right. Thank you, Glen. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Kelly Yamanouchi from Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Your line is live. Kelly Yamanouchi : Thanks. Ed, you mentioned having 10% more employees today than pre-pandemic and essentially driving the same level of operations and the opportunity to get efficient. I was wondering if that means growing operations with the same number of employees or potentially cutting the staffing level. Ed Bastian : Hi, Kelly. No there\u2019s no plans just to cut staffing levels at all. This is about our people being able to garner more experience because a lot of the new employees that we\u2019ve added over the last few years are adding to that 10% and continuing to be a bit more efficient in productivity and the staffing levels. But no, we have no intention to make any reductions in people. Kelly Yamanouchi : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Leslie Josephs from CNBC. Your line is live. Leslie Josephs : Hi, good morning, everyone. Wondering if you are seeing any increased bookings since United and Alaska have had to ground their Max 9s? And then separately maybe this is a question more for Glen, but do you think you\u2019re done with the measures that you had to take last year in terms of the SkyMiles program and lounges to sort of combat crowding, since this year is going to be so busy, and if you have enough premium seats to offer the market currently? Glen Hauenstein : Well, I\u2019ll take the second question first, is, we made some serious changes to our programs that were designed to really put the right people in the right categories so that we could deliver industry leading premium experiences. And as you know, while they were announced in the fall, most of them don\u2019t take into effect until 2025. And I think what we\u2019ve estimated is that should \u2013 we should be done without those kinds of major changes to our programs. Of course, those programs are always changing, but I think the changes moving forward will be much more minimal. So I think that\u2019s behind us. We\u2019ll see how that plays out by the end of this year and into 2025. And your other question was on the Max... Leslie Josephs : On booking. Oh yeah, since the grounding. Glen Hauenstein : We\u2019ve seen a small uptick specifically in Seattle, but Seattle is a small portion of our entire system. So it\u2019s kind of minimal in the grander scheme of things, but it\u2019s relevant in Seattle. Leslie Josephs : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News. Your line is live. Mary Schlangenstein : Yeah, my question was asked. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Alison Sider from Wall Street Journal. Your line is live. Alison Sider : Thank you. I was wondering, do you still think Delta still has the same advantage over rivals just in terms of reliability in its operation? Is that something that you\u2019re kind of working on? Ed Bastian : Hi, Allie, this is Ed. The one thing that we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years which has been great for customers is that the overall reliability in the industry has improved and carriers increasingly are competing over operational performance rather than some other things in the past that people may have been focused against. And I think that\u2019s great and I think it pushes us to be even better, and I think it\u2019s a great outcome for the industry as a whole. So, yes, the competition is definitely more focused on reliability than ever before. And I still expect Delta to maintain its premium lead in that sector. Alison Sider : And then if I could ask about sort of labor shortages, are you concerned at all or starting to feel the impact of a shortage of maintenance workers? Is that something you expect to come to the head this year? Ed Bastian : We are not experiencing any issues around labor shortages. Maybe in very small isolated places we still have some additional people we\u2019d like to bring in, but we are at where we need to be. And for us it\u2019s less about the shortages, it\u2019s more about the new people that we brought on continuing to gain experience, and that\u2019s a big deal, particularly in the maintenance area. Alison Sider : Thanks. Ed Bastian : Thank you, Ali. Matthew, we have time for one final question, please. Operator : Certainly. Your last question is coming from Robert Silk from Travel Weekly. Your line is live. Robert Silk : Oh yeah. Good morning. Glen, you mentioned that you all had gained corporate share this year. I\u2019m wondering if you could elaborate on what caused that. You think how you gained it and there was any impact. Some of it might have come from the removing of bears from the traditional GDS channels by your main competitors? Glen Hauenstein : Yeah. I think one of the issues were we were very inventory constrained in 2022 as we were behind the industry in our rebuild? And in 2023 we caught up back to basically a pre-pandemic level of capacity and those additional seats were enabled more corporates to get on the aircraft. I\u2019d say what\u2019s different about now versus pre-pandemic is that before the pandemic and before the segmentation of customers, the differential between the yields on corporate and the yields on non-corporate high end leisure was significant. And these days those have closed, so now you have competition for the premium seats between those two categories that didn\u2019t exist pre-pandemic. And that\u2019s exciting for us as we manage them. But I think getting more seats available is one of the key priorities in the premium sector so that we can accommodate all the demand. Robert Silk : Okay. Thanks. And what about seeing any sort of share shift based upon your strategy of leaving all your fares available in the traditional EDIFACT GDS? Glen Hauenstein : Yeah. Clearly we think that our strategy is more customer friendly, and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s part of it, but we don\u2019t want to buy it. Robert Silk : Okay. Thank you. Tim Mapes : Matthew that will wrap up the call. If you want to close it up. Operator : Certainly, that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation today.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Julie Stewart : Thank you, Matthew. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our March quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining us from Atlanta today are : CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Dan Janki. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta's performance and strategy, and Glen will provide an update on the revenue environment, Dan will discuss costs and our balance sheet. After the prepared remarks, we'll take analyst questions. We ask you to please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up, so we can get to as many of you as possible. And after the analyst Q&A, we'll move to our media questions. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and all results exclude special items, unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ed. Ed Bastian : Well, thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Earlier this morning, we reported our March quarter results posting pre-tax earnings of $380 million or $0.45 per share, a $0.20 improvement over last year, and revenue that was 6% higher and a new record for first quarter. Free cash flow was $1.4 billion and we delivered a return on invested capital of nearly 14%, putting Delta's returns in the top half of the S&P 500. We are delivering industry-leading operational reliability and have widened the gap to our competition. Last summer, we made forward-leaning investments in the operation. And since then, our teams have delivered operational performance that is among the best in our history, with mainline cancellations down 85%, setting new records for completion factor in both the fourth quarter and the first quarter. I'd like to sincerely thank Delta's 100,000 people for your dedication, professionalism, and hard work in delivering these outstanding results. In February, we recognized the efforts of our people with $1.4 billion in profit-sharing, more than the rest of the industry combined, and continuing Delta's longstanding philosophy to reward industry-leading performance with industry-leading compensation. Reflecting our people-first culture, Forbes ranked Delta the fifth-best large employer in America, and Delta was recently named the 2024 Global Airline of the Year by Air Transport World for our outstanding commitment to safety, operational performance, and premium customer service. While airline travel and transportation is what we do, it's the experiences on Delta that set us apart as a leading consumer brand and why Delta was recognized as number 11 on Fortune's list of the World's Most Admired Companies. Exciting customer-facing enhancements are on the near horizon, including the opening of new Delta One lounges in JFK, Los Angeles, and Boston, the continued introduction of modern and fuel-efficient aircraft, new premium cabin service offerings, upgrades to the Fly Delta app, and the international expansion of fast free Wi-Fi across our fleet. The rollout of Wi-Fi and Delta Sync continues to be a tremendous success. Since launching last year, customers have logged more than 45 million free streaming quality sessions on-board and millions have joined the SkyMiles program through this channel. Recognizing our investment to ensure the future of travel is connected, we took the number two spot in the travel category, a Fast Company's list of the Most Innovative Companies, the only airline to be recognized in the ranking. Loyalty to our brand has never been stronger. We continue to set new records with our remuneration from American Express, our most important commercial relationship and are well on our way to our long-term target of $10 billion. On February the 1, we announced enhanced and refreshed benefits for our Delta Sky Miles American Express Cards, providing more direct value and the customer response has been very positive. Turning to our outlook. With strong first-quarter performance and visibility into the strength of summer travel demand, we remain confident in our full year guidance for earnings of $6 -- $6 to $7 per share, free-cash-flow of $3 billion to $4 billion, and leverage of 2.5 times, the three main guideposts that we shared with you in January. For the June quarter, we expect to deliver the highest quarterly revenue in our history of mid-teens operating margin and earnings of $2.20 to $2.50 per share. Our forecast for pre-tax profit of approximately $2 billion is on par with 2019 and just shy of last year, due to higher fuel prices. Demand continues to be strong and we see a record spring and summer travel season with our 11 highest sales days in our history, all occurring this calendar year. Spending on services recently surpassed goods for the first time in five years and there is further runway to return to their long-term trends. Delta's core consumers are in a healthy position and travel remains a top purchase priority. Generational shifts and evolving consumer preferences are driving secular growth in premium experiences. And business travel demand has taken another meaningful step forward this year with growth accelerating into the mid-teens over last year. When you put this level of demand strength together with the industry's increased focus on improving financial returns, this may be the most constructive backdrop that I've seen in my airline career. Our industry-leading performance continues to demonstrate the strength of Delta's differentiated brand and returns-focused strategy. And with our disciplined approach to capital investment and focus on free cash flow, Delta is exceptionally well-positioned to further strengthen our balance sheet and deliver significant shareholder value. In closing, the momentum in the business continues to build. We are focused on delivering excellent reliability, elevating the customer experience, and improving efficiency across the Company to support growth in our earnings and cash flow. I am excited for Delta's opportunities ahead, and we'll talk more about that and provide new long-term financial targets at our Investor Day, which we are scheduling for November 19 and 20 in New York City. Please put that on your calendar. Thank you again. And with that, let me hand it over to Glen for more details on our commercial performance. Glen Hauenstein : Thank you, Ed, and good morning. I want to start by thanking our employees for providing the best service and reliability in the industry to our customers every single day. 2024 is off to a great start and we're delivering on our commercial priorities to optimize our network, grow higher-margin revenue streams, and invest in our future. Revenue for the March quarter increased 6% year-over-year to a record $12.6 billion on capacity growth of 6.8%. This result is at the high-end of our initial guidance with upside driven by industry-leading operational performance and strength in close-in bookings. Since the start of the year, we've seen a sustained acceleration in business travel. Managed corporate travel sales grew 14% over the prior year, with Technology, Consumer Services and Financial Services leading that momentum. We delivered positive unit revenues in our two largest entities, domestic and transatlantic, reflecting the continued optimization of our network. Total unit revenue growth improved 3 points sequentially to down 0.7%, including nearly a one-point headwind from cargo and MRO. Domestic revenue grew 5% with record March quarter unit revenues, up 3% over the prior year. The more than 7 point improvement from 4Q to 1Q reflects strong demand trends improving industry backdrop. International revenues grew 12% on a unit revenue decline of 3% as unit revenue growth in the transatlantic was muted by capacity investments from the continued rebuild of our Latin and Pacific franchises. Diverse high-margin revenue streams generated 57% of total revenue, differentiating Delta and underpinning industry-leading financial performance. Premium revenue was up 10% over prior year, and we have runway ahead as we continue adding more premium seats to our aircraft, improving our retailing capabilities, and further segmenting our products. Total loyalty revenue grew 12% on continued strength in the American Express co-brand portfolio with record quarterly remuneration of $1.7 billion. Following the refreshed co-brand benefits, we saw our card applications reach new records as we are seeing the highest premium acquisitions mix in our program's history. Turning to our outlook, consumer demand is robust and premium trends remain strong. The outlook for corporate travel is positive. 90% of companies in our recent survey intend to maintain or increase travel volumes in 2Q, putting us back on track to deliver record corporate revenues in the back half of this year. For the June quarter, we expect revenue growth of 5% to 7% on capacity growth of 6% to 7%, with unit revenues flat to down 2% from last year's very strong performance. Similar to the March quarter, 2Q faces a headwind from the normalization of travel credits. Domestically, we expect unit revenues to be flattish over the prior year, with growth focused on restoring our core hubs where departures and seats are not yet fully restored. The final stage of our core hub restoration will be the full return of regional flying. Pilot hiring has stabilized, increasing the capacity we expect to fly over the summer. We expect progressive improvement through 2025, driving higher asset utilization and improving our profitability. In the transatlantic, we are looking forward to another strong summer with record revenues. 2Q unit revenues are expected to be similar to the last year as we lock record performance and benefit from the healthy demand for our premium cabins and improved corporate trends. In Latin America, profitability remains solid. Unit revenues are expected to be down double-digits due to pressure in shortfall leisure markets. These markets are expected to see healthy improvements in the second-half of the year as supply and demand comes back into balance. And while flying into deep South America, we are very pleased with the results. We are increasing capacity about 40% with minimal impact to unit revenues as we continue to deepen our ties with our JV partner LATAM. We expect Pacific unit revenues to be in line with the prior year on 30% growth in capacity, driven by a strong demand for Korea and Japan, offsetting lower unit revenues in China. Profitability is expected to set a record as we continue to harvest the benefits of our multi-year restructuring. In closing, I'm pleased with how we have started 2024. Delta is continuing to lead on all fronts, with industry-leading margins and returns highlighting the strength of our trusted brand and differentiated commercial strategy. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Dan to talk about the financials. Dan Janki : Great. Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. For the March quarter, we delivered pre-tax income of $380 million, an improvement of $163 million over last year. Earnings of $0.45 per share was at the upper end of our guidance as great operational performance and strong demand more than offset higher-than-expected fuel prices. Operational excellence is central to Delta's brand promise, and I couldn't be prouder of how our teams are delivering record reliability for our customers. A strong completion factor drove a 1 point of higher capacity and non-fuel unit cost favorability. Non-fuel CASM was 1.5% above last year and ahead of guidance. Fuel prices averaged $2.76 per gallon, $0.16 higher than the midpoint of our guidance range. The refinery provided a $0.05 benefit, generating a profit of $49 million. This was down $173 million from last year on more normalized refining margins. Fuel efficiency was 1.9% better than last year, benefiting from the continued renewal of our fleet and running a strong operation. Operating margin of 5.1% was a 0.5 point higher year-over-year. Our pre-tax margin improved over a point, benefiting from reduced interest, pension expense, and higher earnings from our equity investments. We generated free cash flow of $1.4 billion. This was after paying $1.4 billion in profit-sharing to our employees and investing $1.1 billion into the business. Debt reduction remains a top priority. Our leverage ratio improved to 2.9 times during the quarter. We repaid $700 million of debt, including $400 million of scheduled maturities and $300 million of additional debt initiatives. We expect to repay at least $4 billion of debt this year and continue to be opportunistic in accelerating debt reduction. We are currently investment-grade rated at Moody's and BB+ at both S&P and Fitch, with all agencies now on positive outlook following updates from Fitch and Moody's during the quarter. Moving to the June quarter guidance. Combined with our outlook for top-line growth, we expect an operating margin of 14% to 15% with earnings of $2.20 to $2.50 per share. Fuel prices are expected to be $2.70 to $2.90 per gallon, including a $0.10 contribution from the refinery. At the midpoint of this range, our all-in fuel price is expected to be over 10% higher than last year. Non-fuel unit costs are expected to be approximately 2% higher than last year, consistent with our full-year outlook of low-single-digit. Growth is normalizing, and we've entered a period of optimization with a focus on restoring our most profitable core hubs and delivering efficiency gains across the enterprise. The investments we made in fleet health and reliability in the second-half of 2023 are paying off, supporting industry-leading operational performance. As we discussed with you in January, these investments are expected to continue through 2024 as we complete an elevated volume of heavy airframe and engine checks, while managing through industry-wide supply chain constraints. The intensity of hiring and training has moderated. The teams have good momentum in delivering on our efficiency goals for the year. This will help fund the investment in our people, in our operations, and the customer experience that support our revenue premium. In closing, we continue to be confident in our full-year outlook of earnings of $6 to $7 per share and free cash flow of $3 billion to $4 billion. Our industry-leading operational and financial performance is a result of the hard work and dedication of the Delta people. I'd like to thank each of them for what they do every day. With that, I'll turn it back to Julie for Q&A. Julie Stewart : Thanks, Dan. Matthew, can you please remind the analysts how to queue up for questions and go to our first analyst question from Duane Pfennigwerth. Operator : Certainly. And at this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is live. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey, good morning. Thank you. Just on the improved cost execution, you just touched on it in the script there, Dan, but can you speak to maintenance expense and the outlook relative to your expectations? The tone sounds like you're turning a corner on maintenance, and how do you think about that line into the second-half and perhaps into next year? Dan Janki : Well, maintenance is -- Duane, thank you. Maintenance is on plan and performing as we expected. As we talked to you at the beginning part of the year, maintenance we expect it to be up year-over-year $350 million. We expect that for the full-year, the first quarter was on plan, and the team is executing well. And those investments, as I mentioned, that we made in fleet health will continue as we go through this year, those proactive visits along touching the aircraft. You're seeing the impact. Cancellations from a maintenance perspective year-over-year were down 80% sequentially, they improved 30%. So team is doing a good job. They're on plan and as expected. Ed Bastian : Duane, if I could add on to that, I want to congratulate the Tech Ops team, John Laughter, whose leadership over there in terms of helping to make that turn. We are seeing a renewed set of confidence back in the team. It's been a tough few years on the rebuild. Too early to declare victory. We know the supply chain continues to have a tremendous amount of constraint in it. But I'm confident that we're on a good journey. It's a good path here. Duane Pfennigwerth : Appreciate those thoughts. And then maybe more of a conceptual one for my follow-up on corporate and the continued recovery in corporate you're pointing to. I assume that's generally close in. And I wonder if you could comment on if you're seeing a decrease in average trip length. So maybe more trips but fewer days on the road per trip. Any commentary on those trends? Glen Hauenstein : No, I'd just say we're seeing both. We're seeing some shorter and we're seeing some longer where people are blending the leisure trip with the business trip. So -- and generally, they are purchasing a little bit further out than they had and I think that's related to not having change fees any longer. So, we've seen some changes in the booking curve but really encouraged by what we see in terms of corporate bookings as we look forward through this quarter and as we look forward into the next couple of quarters. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live. Mike Linenberg : Oh, yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. Glen, I just -- I want to get back -- you talked about the normalization of travel credits and how that still represents a bit of a headwind. What -- can you quantify what that impact is on June TRASM? Glen Hauenstein : I think we said in our previous that we faced headwinds in up to a couple of points. And I think we're not going to go into the details of that, but that's generally what we've disclosed in the past. Yes. Mike Linenberg : Okay, great. And then just my second question to Ed. Ed, can you just give us an update on the status of the -- I guess it's an appeal process with the DOT on Aeromexico? How does that play out or I should say, what is the timeline of that and any milestones we should look forward with respect to that? Thanks. Peter Carter : Hey, Mike, it's Peter Carter. Thanks for the question. That was a tentative order. And I think, as you know, our strong view is, the DOT really struck out on that one. They're typically a great partner. But this was an example of regulatory overreach, which is why we've challenged it. It's bad for consumers. It's bad for competition. It's bad for the local economies that those flights have served. We are currently engaged with the administration and discussing, I'll say, less punitive solutions than the tentative order that was proposed. And I would say, we've had hundreds of our, I'll say, allies with respect to the connection between Mexico and America weigh in, in support of this joint venture. So, we think this is going to take some time before the DOT issues a final order, a number of months, but we're cautiously optimistic that they are going to come up with a better solution. Mike Linenberg : Great. Thanks for that, Peter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Your line is live. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning. So, Glen, when I think about the original guide for the year or three months ago, I think it was sort of flat RASM for the year. So, we're down slightly in Q1, midpoint of guide for Q2 down slightly. So, what's the -- what's your visibility to second half RASM inflection? I guess ultimately, at this point, do you see more upside or downside risk to that flat RASM? And maybe just with that like the travel credit headwind, is that bigger or smaller in second-half? Glen Hauenstein : No, I think it's pretty -- first on the travel credit headwinds, it's consistent through the year. But what I would say is that we're ahead of our internal plan to get to flattish for the year and the comps get easier as we move through the year. And if you look at the back half of guidance as well as what people have loaded in their schedules, it looks like industry capacity is reaching a peak in 2Q. So, I think we see a great setup for the back half of this year and we're on plan or ahead of plan for where we sit right now. Scott Group : Okay. And then, I just want to follow-up just on RASM a little bit. So, if you just -- last year, your absolute RASM in the second quarter just meaningfully outperformed seasonality, and then you underperformed in Q3, right? If you look this year, you're guiding again like to really outperform like pre-pandemic seasonality. I'm wondering, do you think that there is a seasonal shift from Q3 into Q2 relative to what we used to see and does that help in Q2? Does it potentially hurt Q3? I'm just curious your thoughts on that. Ed Bastian : I have thoughts, some very -- yes, it has changed. And it's related to schools coming back in the South in particular earlier and earlier into August. As a matter of fact, here I believe schools in Georgia go back the first week of August now. And so, that has materially changed, I think over the years, making the second quarter stronger and making the third quarter a bit weaker. But I think we're -- as we think about how we plan that now, we're incorporating that into our capacity plans moving forward. Scott Group : Okay. All right. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So, it looks like your leverage is getting to be in a pretty good place. When do you think you can start flexing the balance sheet for other use of cash, kind of CapEx, cash return kind of over the next 12 months? Ed Bastian : Well, thanks, Ravi. We're not in a position yet to make any comments or any decisions around that. We still have more debt than we're comfortable with and that continues to be the first call on cash to continue to take risk off the table. Interesting, I was looking at some numbers preparing for this call, if you look at our target for the end of this year and you factor in that we actually have eliminated the Pension H obligation, which we had at the end of 2019. We're actually pretty close to the leverage ratio we were at the end of 2019 entering the pandemic. So, we have made a lot of progress. That said, we'll be talking a bit about that at our Investor Day in November. And -- but the first call will be and will be for some time to pay down the debt. Yes. Ravi Shanker : Got it. That's helpful. And maybe as a follow-up and a little bit of a nuanced detail question here, kind of obviously, with the Paris Olympics kind of being a pretty big catalyst for transatlantic travel in this summer, kind of are we thinking of that potentially bringing on some noise towards end of 2Q, early 3Q? Kind of is that something that you would caution us in terms of modeling our cadence versus seasonality? Ed Bastian : Well, generally, the Olympics are not good for airline revenues, and this year I think is no exception to that. So, while we see a very favorable backdrop for Europe in its totality, there are some challenges for Paris as generally business travel ceases to and from the local markets as the Olympics approach. So, I wouldn't say that that's going to be a windfall. It's actually going to be a bit of a headwind for us in the numbers we shared with you. Glen Hauenstein : That said, we are very excited as the sponsor of Team USA for the Paris Olympics and we'll get through it. Ravi Shanker : Very helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Helane Becker from TD Cowen. Your line is live. Helane Becker : Thanks very much, operator. So, hi, team. I just have two questions. In the first quarter, your landing fee seemed a little bit higher than I would normally expect to see for a first quarter. Is that -- maybe you can explain that rather than me suggesting what it could be? And then for my follow-up question, one of the issues that American Express cardholders have, of which I am one, is acceptance rate, especially in Europe. And I'm wondering if you're starting to see an improvement in that area as well. Thank you. Dan Janki : Yes. On landing fees, when you look at it year-over-year, yes, they're up, volume, one; two related to the cut-in as it relates to our generational redevelopment projects, you're picking up some of that expense. And then I would say the third item, airports across the country in 2022 and 2023 benefited from Cares. And as those have now gone away, they're adjusting their rates and you're seeing that come through. Helane Becker : Okay. That's very helpful. Ed Bastian : And on American Express global acceptance rates, we worked very hard years back with American Express on improving the domestic acceptance rates and right now they're at all-time highs in terms of the number of merchants that you can use American Express at domestically and they are also doing that internationally. So, particularly places that we're strong and we work with them on prioritizing those places that Americans like to go for vacations. Helane Becker : Okay. Well, that's very helpful. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Andrew Didora from Bank of America. Your line is live. Andrew Didora : Hey, good morning, everyone. So, Glen, I had a question just with regards to your capacity. How are you thinking about the cadence as we move into the back half of the year? Obviously, with the first half capacity up north of 6%, 3Q schedules are still sort of above your 3% to 5% original guide. How should we think about your growth as we move through the back of the year, because it would imply-based on 3Q schedules that 4Q would be down. I kind of find that hard to believe, but just any thoughts there would be helpful. Thank you. Glen Hauenstein : I think we're going to -- first of all, thanks to our operating teams who have given us such exceptional completion factors that accounted for even higher than we had planned for. So, I'd say if those continue, which I imagine they will or hope they will, that we would be at the high of the 3% to 5%. And I think it's a bit early to say, but I think that we will be right at that 5% depending on how the completion factor comes in. Andrew Didora : That's helpful. Thank you. And then, I think in your prepared remarks, you spoke to MRO -- MRO headwinds in the ancillary revenue line in the quarter. What is driving that? I just would have thought, given everyone's elevated maintenance expense, it would have been a little bit more of a tailwind. Any thoughts there? Thank you. Dan Janki : Yes. I'd say two things. One is, as it relates to our third-party activity, it's just -- we're always -- we're constrained by what the industry is constrained by, which is material and ability to generate that output. And as we've talked about, our Tech Ops team, John, and the team are focused on the Delta fleet. So -- but I would say the constraint continues to be immaterial and turnaround times associated with it. Andrew Didora : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jamie Baker from J.P. Morgan. Your line is live. Jamie Baker : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. A couple for Glen. First on the topic of RASM premiums. Pre-COVID, you were running about a 20% domestic premium to the industry and I think you were roughly flat on international. You and I spoke on one of the earnings calls as to what that -- what the path to achieving an international RASM premium might look like. Can we revisit that topic? Where is Delta currently both domestic and international? And where do you see that heading from here in a post-COVID world? Glen Hauenstein : Well, thanks for the question, Jamie. I think right now, we believe we are running international RASM premiums that are primarily been driven by higher load factors on the fleet. But as the fleet continues to evolve and we continue to put more premium seats in the mix, we believe that is one of the key drivers for us to continue to accelerate our relative performance to our industry peers. So, I think we're on a journey there and I think we are now generating premiums consistently and hopefully, we can accelerate those over the next several years as we execute on our plans to differentiate Delta. Jamie Baker : And as a follow-up, Glen, on premium, so premium revenue was up 10% in the quarter, main cabin was up 4%. What can you tell us about the constitution of that 4%? For example, what's the trend with basic economy, what percent of main cabin passengers are SkyMiles members compared to the premium cabins, that sort of thing? I'm just trying to understand where the 4% is coming from. Are those new customers? Are you taking share from discounters, that sort of thing? Thanks. Glen Hauenstein : I think in the quarter, we ran a record domestic load factor in the first quarter. So, what I believe drove that was the incremental traffic that we took over historical levels. So, pretty excited about doing that in the first quarter, as you know, the first quarter is the most challenging in terms of loads. And for us to come through that quarter with the premiums that we took, I think really is a testament to the strength of our brand. And of course, as we get through the year, there'll be less and less discounted seats available as you get towards peak, but generally, we're most open in 1Q. Yes. Jamie Baker : Okay. Very helpful. Thank you, everyone. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is live. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. So, Glen, I guess I wanted to come back to domestic growth this summer because it looks like you're jumping up to 6% or 7% from about 2% in the first quarter. And the context around this, I think investors were a little bit concerned that, that growth could lead to lower RASMs, but obviously, you're guiding to flat. So, can you dig a little bit deeper on your domestic network priorities and maybe a little bit more on regional expansion? Glen Hauenstein : Right. I think there -- what we've said in the past and I would like to go back to is, we kind of coming out of COVID, we had to allocate the resources that had -- we had available. And those resources went to our once-in-a-lifetime opportunities to take leading positions in places like Boston and Los Angeles at the expense of rebuilding our core hubs and we're still not done building our core hubs. And so, our ability now to go back and to put seats back into our core where our cost structure is most advantaged and where our profitability is highest is where we're focused for the rest of this year. Dan Janki : And seat growth is about a point below, some growth that they see. Yes. Brandon Oglenski : Okay. Appreciate that. And then Glen, on the Latin differentiation, I think you were talking separately about short-haul and long-haul. Can you unpack that a little bit more for us? Glen Hauenstein : Well, we are really pleased with our South America performance. As I said in the prepared remarks, our capacity is up in the 30% to 40% range and we're doing that with minimal degradation of our unit revenue. So we're really off to a great start with LATAM and I think we have a really great future of working with them to continue to evolve as the leading carrier between the United States and South America in our joint venture. So, put that aside and then say the -- particularly, leisure destinations, there was an oversupply in the first quarter. I think in first quarter of '23, the industry saw historically higher returns. And so when there are historically high returns, everybody wants to do more of it. We did considerably more of it. The industry did considerably more of it. And listen, it was quite profitable for us, but at the expense of unit revenues. And so, as we move through next year, I'd say there's going to be probably a moderation of capacity as there always is when those things happen as well as easier comps as we get to next year. So, I'm looking forward to actually next year's comps in Latin America. Brandon Oglenski : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Your line is live. Conor Cunningham : Hi, everyone. Thank you. Just if we play back the performance in the US domestic market in 1Q, it was pretty fantastic when you started off saying just expecting to inflect positive in March and you saw some improvement in quarter, then an outcome of plus 3%. You've highlighted corporate momentum in premium, but I think there's a disparity in just your hub performance. Can you just talk about coastal gateways versus core hub rebuild and how things are playing out there, just in general? Thank you. Glen Hauenstein : Well, I think we're very pleased with our coastal gateways and really they're moving in a pretty tight band right now with more capacity going to our core hubs and our core hubs generally having a higher unit revenue base than our coastal gateways, that should have a positive inflection on total revenues. And I think that gets accelerated in the second and third quarters. Again, we had probably a little bit more in Boston than we had planned on because there were some opportunities there for us to move airplanes in. But generally, we're really pleased with where we sit today and how the back half of this year should play out for us. Conor Cunningham : Okay. And then, it seems like there's a potential for regulatory oversight to potentially pick up here. When you have conversations with the FAA, what are some changes that they're talking to you about just given the operating environment? And maybe what are you asking them in general? It just seems like it could be a wildcard to potential growth, maybe medium-to-long term. So, just any thoughts there would be helpful. Thank you. Peter Carter : Hey, Conor, this is Peter. So, just I'd say, fundamentally with the FAA, we're working very closely with them around staffing models, because as you know, there's an air traffic control shortage. And we're also engaged in Washington trying to help solve some of those, I'll say, more structural challenges around infrastructure. You probably have seen that the industry has made a request off the FAA to extend the New York Slot Waiver another season. And that's what I would call responsible partnership with our regulator in light of the staffing challenges they've had. So, a great relationship, deep partnership with them. Conor Cunningham : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is live. Savi Syth : Hey, good morning. Just a follow-up to Jamie's question on the premium revenue. Just kind of curious if you could share how much of that 10% is coming from volume versus yield, and I think you mentioned continuing to grow the premium offering. So just curious what the trend might be. Glen Hauenstein : Right. I would say, right now, the premium is probably 50-50 split between traffic and yield. Savi Syth : That's helpful. And then in terms of the volume growth in offering, how should we think about that? Glen Hauenstein : Well, I think we've said that, if you look at the longer-term trends, that we really haven't been adding coach seats into the domestic arena over the past 10 years. And so, all of our growth has been in the premium products and services. And I think on Investor Day, we're going to talk a little bit more about where we see that going, but I think we see a long runway for that in the coming years. Dan Janki : Yes. Premium product while pace main cabin all the way as you look at our fleet deliveries through 2030. Savi Syth : Helpful. And if I might on another follow-up, just on the domestic capacity growth with building back the hubs, is that then where the capacity comes a lot in this kind of regional-type markets or should I think of it as kind of growth in regional then shift some of those aircraft on to kind of other bigger markets that you could use those aircraft? Glen Hauenstein : I think little of both. We've been very short on our regionals. We still have probably at least 50 regionals either not flying or underutilized, probably almost 100 when you include the underutilization. So, that's a lot of seats and a lot of departures that we need in our hubs and we're missing a lot of the core feed from the regional feed in the local vicinity. So, right now, some of that's being done by Mainline and those planes can gravitate out, but mostly we'll be adding frequencies back in that historically have been there from feeder markets into our core hubs. Savi Syth : Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from David Vernon from Bernstein. Your line is live. David Vernon : Maybe just following up on that point of thought there, Glen, as you think about the improvements in the regional utilization, is there also some room for improving utilization to prior pre-COVID levels on the narrow body fleet as well? Or is this primarily just a regional issue? Glen Hauenstein : No, I would hope so. If we look at our wide bodies, we're now at or above where we were in '19 in terms of annual utilization. And this is going to be a game of working with our operators to improve asset utilization across the network, whatever they are, planes, airports. And that's the game we're playing, that's the long game and I think that's been a really exciting challenge for us all. David Vernon : Yes. Okay. And then I guess as you think about the yield management, it's a problem sort of through the summer months, you seem to have a lot more premium capacity into the mix. Does that change the way you guys go about sort of the day-to-day in managing pricing? Are there other opportunities in there that you see to continue to kind of work the segmented cabin differently than you may have done in the past? I'm just trying to get a sense for -- as this new sort of model is being marketed at a higher level of volume and a greater distribution of the number of seats you have on each aircraft, is that changing sort of the upper frontier on what you might be able to get out of yield management? Glen Hauenstein : Well, I think what we said is that, what really pushed us to do this journey several years back was the fact that on the premium products and experiences side, we controlled more of our destiny than we did on the commodity side. And so absolutely, that's been our journey, is to continue to play the game against ourselves as opposed to playing against the lowest common denominator. And I think we'll have a lot again on our Investor Day to talk about what we see the next evolution. But we see a lot of runway -- not to tease it out, but we see a lot of runway in taking this even further and using new tools and using things that we'll be talking about in November that I think will be very exciting for our investor base. David Vernon : Okay. And then last one for me is that you mentioned something about sort of improvements in retailing. Could you elaborate a little bit around what you're talking about there? Glen Hauenstein : Well, I think that that's the holy grail is, why did we wind up in a commoditized environment was because we couldn't distribute products and services. We weren't -- the industry was not geared to this. And this has been our long journey. And every day, I think we get better and better and better at it, whether or not we're working internally to improve our own internal displays where we're 65% direct-to-consumer right now or whether we're working with online booking tools to improve their display of products and services and making progress on that front as well. So, this has been a very, very long journey and every day we're working on improving it. David Vernon : All right. Thanks very much for the time, guys. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Your line is live. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Hi, good morning, everyone. Thank you for the time. Maybe just a follow-up on Latin America. The large capacity growth there in partnership with LATAM obviously magnifies the unit revenue decline, but you've, of course, talked about making these investments profitably. So maybe can you talk about where you are with -- today relative to your expectations in Latin America and how you expect that profitability curve to shape up in the coming quarters and years? Glen Hauenstein : Yes. I think we still see opportunity. We've got -- a lot of the opportunities now are in our baseline and we'll continue to work with LATAM to refine that moving forward. But I don't think you'll see this kind of dramatic growth in the out years as we'll be more focused on turning that into more of a harvest mode as opposed to an investment mode as we continue to work on bridging the two networks together. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Okay. And then maybe one on cost, just to sum it up, Q1 TRASM performance was really good, Ed, and you talked about completion factors and just operations helping that. So, the Q2 guide assumes a bit more normalized putting you guys at 2% cost growth. So, is it just fair to think about that run rate in the context of the year with a low-single-digit guide? And what are the moving pieces as we think about headcount, maintenance costs, and any other noise you'd highlight throughout the year? Dan Janki : Yes. I think the 2% is in line with the low-single-digit. I think when you think about the variables inside of that run -- it starts with running a great operation. When you run a great operation, that sets the foundation. You get those frictional costs out and it really allows the operators and you're seeing it in two quarters in a row to have the confidence and really lean in and continue to drive not only better improvement in the operation but also get after those efficiencies. And as you do that, in a lot -- we said that we're carrying headcount higher than historical for what we ran in 2019, about 10%, and we'll grow into that and that drives the efficiency associated with that. And no change to maintenance. Maintenance is as we expected and -- but we'll continue to manage the supply chain. It's going to be the one that is -- has the largest constraint still associated with it as we execute through the year. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Great. Thank you. Julie Stewart : Matthew, we'll now go to our final analyst question before moving to the media. Operator : Certainly. Your last question is coming from Stephen Trent from Citi. Your line is live. Stephen Trent : Good morning, everybody, and thanks very much for squeezing me in. Just a follow-up question to Sheila's, if I may. When we think about probably the -- across the industry fleets getting older, could you give us a high-level sense about how valuable Delta TechOps is going to be for you guys over the next 10 years, for example, and that competitive advantage you have versus your legacy competitors? Thank you. Dan Janki : Yes, we can. I think it is a unique advantage, that along with our fleet, our fleet has actually gotten younger over the last few years. But we've also given the constraints in the industry around the OEMs, have leaned into restore the network into our flex fleets. So, flying 80 717s, flying the 757s longer than we anticipated, and that puts demand on our TechOps teams, and their ability to ensure that we have those aircraft, that they're reliable, is -- really allows us to flex and be more nimble. And as we go through this period and it gets more normalized, we're in a period of more normalized growth and more consistency around equipment, it's also going to allow us to go into a period of more natural retirements. We haven't retired any aircraft in 2022 and 2023. We'll start that at the back half of this year and that's really where our team has always shined, the ability to naturally retire but then recoup that equipment and reuse that used material and run out the fleets and they did it with the MD-88s and 90s. They've done it for a decade and they have that history. And that's really what we have in front of us. Ed Bastian : Stephen, if I could add on the back end of Dan's comments, two things. In the first quarter, our overall mainline reliability and completion factor was the strongest first quarter in our history. And that's quite a statement given where we've been through and the supply-chain constraints that still exist and I attribute a lot of that to the maintenance team -- the TechOps team, having the product ready every day and responding to the opportunities that we see in front of us. So that's going to continue to be a positive green arrow forward as we move forward these next couple of years, as Dan was saying. Second thing is the MRO, while we've taken, I'd say, a pause given that we've had to focus our energies on our own fleet as compared to our customer's fleets. Going forward in the next couple of years, that's going to start turning back on again. And that growth rate that we've talked about is still there. It's just waiting for us. And I'm very, very excited as to what you talk about a five to 10-year timeline on that. That business is, I think is going to be -- our ability to capture that business is going to be even stronger than we were thinking pre-pandemic given what we've all been through. So, hats off to the TechOps team, a lot more work to go, but we are absolutely on the right path. Stephen Trent : Thank you very much, Ed and Dan. I appreciate the time. Julie Stewart : Thanks, Steve. That will wrap up the analyst portion of the call. I'll now turn it over to Tim Mapes to start the media questions. Tim Mapes : Thank you, Julie. Matthew, if you don't mind, as we transition from the analysts to reporters, could you repeat the instructions for one question and a follow-up, please? Operator : Certainly. At this time, we'll be conducting a Q&A session for media questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Leslie Josephs from CNBC. Your line is live. Leslie Josephs : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. On operations, just wondering if you saw any benefit from the fact that a lot of your hubs this past winter got rain and not blizzards? It seems like if it was 10, 15 degrees cooler, we have been talking about grounding the airline for a little bit at those hubs. And then separately, on the mechanical issues that some airlines have been having recently, have you reminded your employees or put out any kind of communication just to ensure that they're following all protocols and just kind of reemphasize safety at Delta? Thanks. Ed Bastian : Hi, Leslie, it's Ed. With respect to weather, we certainly have had a nice run of weather broadly across our system, candidly, across our country. And that certainly has helped with respect to the overall operational performance. But what we like to do is neutralize for weather events and we see the performance of the airline weather-adjusted within our own system and we're outperforming our prior performance even weather-adjusted. So, the improved weather just adds nice icing to the cake, but the fundamental, the core is running at a much, much better clip. And as the communications, safety is job one at all times, every single day. We don't send out special messages around safety. We -- every day is Safety Day around here. Leslie Josephs : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News. Your line is live. Mary Schlangenstein : Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask on the request for an addition of the Slot Waivers through another year. Have you seen any improvement at all in the ATC issues in the New York area? And does the Slot Waiver extension also include the DC area? Peter Carter : So, Mary, thank you. It's Peter Carter. It does traditionally include the DC area. That's the way the FAA likes to view it. And we still have a shortage of ATC controllers. So, it's still an incredibly challenging environment. Mary Schlangenstein : Have you seen any improvement at all? Peter Carter : Well, we've had the waivers -- we've had the waivers in place. So of course, with those waivers, there would be improvement because there's less capacity in that marketplace. But absent the waiver, I think we'd have some -- as an industry, some real challenges in New York. Mary Schlangenstein : Great. Thank you very much. Tim Mapes : Thank you for the question, Mary. Matthew, I believe that wraps up our time, if you want to close out the call. Operator : Certainly. Thank you. That completes our Q&A session. And everyone, this concludes today's event. You may disconnect at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time all participants are on a listen-only mode until a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Julie Stewart : Thank you, Matthew. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our June Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining us from Atlanta today are CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Dan Janki. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta's performance and strategy. Glen will provide an update on the revenue environment, and Dan will discuss costs and our balance sheet. After the prepared remarks, we'll take analyst questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up so that we can get to as many of you as possible. And after the analyst Q&A, we'll move to our media questions. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or our expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filing. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ed. Ed Bastian : Well, thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Earlier this morning, we reported our June quarter results, posting pre-tax earnings of $2 billion or $2.36 per share, on record quarterly revenue up 5.4% over last year. These results are the second highest quarterly earnings in our history. We achieved a 15% operating margin and generated $1.3 billion of free cash during the quarter, bringing our first half free cash flow to $2.7 billion. With strong cash generation, we continued to progress our balance sheet back towards investment grade metrics and announced a 50% increase to our quarterly dividend. We delivered a return on invested capital of 13%, 5 points above our cost of capital and in the top half of the S&P 500. Delta's leadership is increasingly being recognized alongside some of the world's best companies. Just last month, Delta was ranked fourth in the Fortune 500 return on leadership by Fortune and Indigo, just behind Nvidia and Microsoft. Through the year, our teams have delivered industry-leading operational performance month in and month out, with Delta leading across all key metrics, including completion factor, on-time departures, and arrivals. This performance builds on our long-standing position as the most reliable airline in the US, and I'd like to thank all 100,000 members of our team for their exceptional work taking care of our customers each and every day. They are truly the best in the business. Recognizing the extraordinary skill and care of our people, Delta was named the 2024 Global Airline of the Year by Air Transport World at the recent IATA Annual Meeting. And for the sixth year in a row, The Points Guy ranked Delta as the best US Airline. Delta was also recently named the top-ranked carrier across all premium cabins in J.D. Power's North American Airline Satisfaction study. Sharing our success with our people is core to our culture and we are at the forefront on total rewards for our employees. We provided a 5% pay raise on the 1st of June to eligible employees and we have accrued more than $640 million in profit sharing through the first half of the year. I am confident our profit sharing payout next February will continue to lead the industry by a wide margin. Our people are the foundation that enables Delta to deliver elevated experiences to our customers. To further differentiate our service excellence, we are making high return investments that make travel more seamless and connected, including generational airport rebuilds, the most comprehensive Lounge network in the industry, expanded premium offerings, and fast free Wi-Fi on board. Just a few weeks ago, we opened our new Delta One Lounge in JFK, the first of its kind. It offers a variety of world-class amenities for our customers, from fine dining to spa treatments. And later this year, we'll open Delta One Lounges in Boston and Los Angeles and in Seattle early next year. We're also enhancing existing Delta Sky clubs with the recent expansion of the Miami and LaGuardia clubs. On board, we have upgraded service in our Delta Premium Select Cabin and will expand this popular product to select transcontinental flights this fall. We recently released the most comprehensive refresh of the Fly Delta app in the last five years. Updates to the app added new features and functionality to save customers time and manage their travel even when the unexpected happens. Since the launch a record number of customers have visited the app with self-service usage during periods of disruption up five full points, improving the customer experience. And more and more customers are joining our SkyMiles loyalty program and deepening engagement beyond flight, with about 30% of our active members carrying a Delta SkyMiles American Express credit card in their wallet. New card acquisitions are skewing younger, and the overall portfolio continues to shift to a more premium mix, positioning us well to achieve our long-term remuneration goal of $10 billion. Finally, just this week we are excited to announce an exclusive partnership with Riyadh Air, a new global carrier that will begin service in Saudi Arabia next year. Riyadh Air will be the Premier International Airline for Saudi Arabia, and its partnership will expand connectivity and premium travel options for both airlines across North America, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and beyond. The agreement comes amid large-scale investments in the region that are rapidly transforming the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia into a popular destination for leisure and business travel with tremendous opportunity for growth. All of our continued investments across the travel ribbon strengthen Delta's trusted brand and build on our long-term journey to elevate the travel experience and increase our financial durability. Delta's industry leadership has never been greater, and while demand for air travel remains strong, with record TSA travel volumes up 7% from last year's levels, domestic industry [seat] (ph) growth has accelerated through the summer months, impacting yield performance in the main cabin. As the carrier of choice with a diversified revenue base, Delta is the most insulated from this dynamic. We are delivering double-digit margins and strong returns in this environment, with Delta expected to generate 50% of the industry's profitability in the first half of the year, despite only representing 20% of the market capacity. That said, we are encouraged by the actions the industry is taking. Seat growth is decelerating, and there appears to be increased focus on improving financial performance. While our returns are strong, I'm confident that we'll see an even more constructive industry backdrop through the back half of the year and into 2025. Turning to our outlook, travel remains a top purchase priority, and Delta's core customers are in a healthy position. The secular shift in consumer spend to prioritize experiences align perfectly with Delta's strategy and premium focus across our global network. Air travel demand is at record levels with this past Sunday marking Delta's highest-ever summer revenue day. For the September quarter, we expect continued demand strength, a double-digit operating margin, and a pre-tax profit of approximately $1.5 billion. Glen and Dan will provide more details on our third quarter outlook. With strong first half performance and good visibility into the second half, we remain confident in our full year guidance for earnings of $6 to $7 per share, free cash flow of $3 billion to $4 billion, and leverage of 2.5 times. In closing, as we approach our 100-year anniversary in 2025, Delta is in a stronger position than ever before. Our industry-leading performance reflects the strength of Delta's differentiated brand and returns-focused strategy. And with our clear prioritization of free cash flow and debt reduction, Delta is exceptionally well-positioned to deliver significant shareholder value. We look forward to sharing more about our long-term strategic and financial goals at our upcoming Investor Day in New York this November. Thank you again. And with that, let me hand it over to Glen for more details on our commercial performance. Glen Hauenstein : Thank you, Ed, and good morning. I want to start by thanking our employees for their hard work and dedication. They are the Delta difference. Revenue for the June quarter increased 5.4% year-over-year to a record $15.4 billion. Total unit revenue was down 2.6% compared to last year, below our guidance due to three dynamics. First, domestic industry seat growth accelerated into the summer months beyond normal demand growth. This has impacted main cabin unit revenue trends through the summer. With scheduled seat growth decelerating into the fall, June and July will be the low point with unit revenue trends expected to significantly improve in August and beyond. Second, we are seeing about a $100 million impact on travel to Paris for the Olympics from June to August. Outside of this temporary event, summer travel demand to Europe is strong and consistent with our expectations. And lastly, as Ed noted, we ran a great operation with a high completion factor. Premium continued to outperform and differentiate our results. Premium revenue was up 10% over prior year with positive unit revenue growth. We have runway ahead as we continue adding more premium seats to our aircraft, improving our retailing capabilities, and further segmenting our products. Loyalty has also outperformed with revenue up 8% as our SkyMiles member base continues to expand. Spend growth in our co-brand card portfolio is expected to continue outpacing the credit card industry. American Express Renumeration for the quarter was $1.9 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Cargo revenue was 16% higher than the previous year, a significant improvement from the last 12 months, and we are encouraged by the trends we're seeing. Diverse revenue streams generated 56% of total revenue. These valuable revenue streams led by premium and loyalty are continuing higher growth and margins underpinning Delta's industry-leading financial performance and increasing our financial durability. Domestic passenger revenue was up 5% over the prior year, and international passenger revenue grew up 4% over last year's record June quarter. As the business carrier of choice, Delta benefited from double-digit volume growth in this high-value segment with broad demand and growth across all sectors. Looking forward, demand for travel on Delta remains robust. Our core customer base is healthy, and demand for premium products continues to outperform the main cabin. We expect the strong growth in business travel to continue, with 90% of companies in our recent corporate survey saying they intend to maintain or increase travel volumes in the back half of the year. International demand is strong and continues to benefit from demographic shifts, US point-of-sale changes, and an extension of the leisure travel season. As our international network and core hubs approach full restoration and we return to a more normal cadence of retiring aircraft, Delta's capacity growth decelerates into the second half of the year. For the September quarter, we expect capacity growth of 5% to 6% and revenue growth of 2% to 4%. Total unit revenue is expected to sequentially improve each month. In domestic, we expect an inflection to positive unit revenue growth in the month of September. We also expect transatlantic unit revenue trends to improve into the fall. And in Latin America, we expect unit revenue trends to progressively improve through the back half of the year. Lastly, in the Pacific, we are continuing to restore our network and are very pleased with the early results from our new service to Taipei and the success of our partnership with Korean Air. Pacific margins are sustaining at a meaningfully higher level than pre-pandemic due to our multi-year restructuring driving sustainable profitability. For the full year, we expect to deliver a sustained unit revenue premium, double-digit margins and returns well in excess of our cost of capital. Our ability to deliver these outstanding results while the industry works to reestablish equilibrium reflects Delta's growing differentiation and leadership. In closing, I want to congratulate the Delta team for an outstanding first half of 2024. We are well positioned to continue our momentum through the second half and for years to come. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan to talk about the financials. Dan Janki : Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. For the June quarter, we delivered pre-tax income of $2 billion on a 15% operating margin. Earnings of $2.36 per share was in-line with our guidance and in-line with 2019 despite fuel prices that were more than 25% higher. Non-fuel CASM was up 0.6% year-over-year, more than 1 point better than guidance primarily on stronger completion factor. A great operation is the foundation of a competitive cost structure. And in the June quarter, we delivered a 99.5% system completion factor, including 13 cancel-free brand-perfect days. For the first half, Delta has delivered 39 brand perfect days, more than all of last year combined. Fuel prices average $2.64 per gallon for the quarter. This included a $0.06 benefit from a refinery profit of $60 million. Fuel efficiency was 1.1% better than last year, benefiting from the continued renewal of our fleet and running a great operation. Operating cash flow in the first half was $4.9 billion, and after reinvesting $2.3 billion back into the business, we generated free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Strong cash generation has supported debt repayment of $2.1 billion year-to-date, including $900 million of early repayments. Gross leverage ended the quarter at 2.8 times. We remain on track to repay $4 billion of debt this year and are committed to further strengthening our balance sheet with a focus on returning to full investment grade. Delta is currently investment-grade rated at Moody's and BB+ at both S&P and Fitch with all agencies with a positive outlook. With strong results and cash flow through the first half, we announced a 50% increase in our quarterly dividend. This puts our annualized dividend yield at just over 1%, in-line with the S&P 500. Now moving to the September quarter guidance. Combined with our outlook for top-line growth, we expect an operating margin of 11% to 13% with earnings of $1.70 to $2 per share. Fuel prices are expected to be $2.60 to $2.80 per gallon, including an approximately $0.05 contribution from the refinery. Refinery margins have normalized and profits are expected to be $60 million lower compared to the third quarter of last year. Non-fuel unit costs are expected to be 1% to 2% higher than last year on 5% to 6% capacity growth. With normalized growth and consistency in delivering a great operation, we are making progress in driving efficiency and growing into our resources. On maintenance, the investment in fleet health we made since last summer are paying off, with maintenance cancellations in the first half down 77% over prior years. We continue to expect full year maintenance expense to be up $350 million over 2023, as we progress through elevated volume of heavy airframe and engine checks and continue to manage industry-wide supply constraints. The majority of this increase was in the first half of the year, with second half maintenance expense expected to be similar on a year-over-year basis. Total non-fuel unit costs in the second half are expected to increase in the low single digits, as we fund investments in our people and brand and capacity growth decelerates. For the year, our fleet growth is expected to be less than 2%, including approximately 40 aircraft deliveries and 20 retirements. Our unencumbered asset base is expected to grow to $30 billion by year-end, as we continue to pay cash for our new deliveries. We remain confident in our full year outlook of earnings of $6 to $7 per share and free cash flow of $3 billion to $4 billion with full year CapEx expected to be $5 billion. With a continued focus on margin and returns to drive sustained cash flow generation, Delta is well-positioned to improve our balance sheet to investment-grade metrics and deliver shareholder value. In closing, Delta's industry-leading performance is a direct result of the hard work of our employees. I want to thank the Delta people for continuing to go above and beyond for our customers and each other every day. And with that, I'll turn it back to Ed for a final remark. Ed Bastian : Thank you, Dan. And before we begin to Q&A, I want to personally recognize and congratulate Helane Becker on a very accomplished career as an analyst covering this industry for four decades. Helane, I have a great amount of respect for you and for all the work that you've done through the years. And while I know you'll be continuing in an advisory role, we will miss working with you and wish you all the best. May the golf gods be good to you. Operator, please begin the Q&A. Operator : Certainly. At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Your line is live. Conor Cunningham : Hi everyone thank you. And yeah, congrats, Helane. Good luck on the golf game. In terms of the comment on September for the US domestic market, can you just help bridge the gap there? My guess is that you are pretty minimally booked for September. So is it just an industry supply getting better? Just given the discounting that's happening right now, it's just a little hard to wrap my head around. So just any thoughts there would be helpful. Thank you. Glen Hauenstein : Sure, Conor. I wouldn't say we are minimally booked. We probably have about [one-third] (ph) of September bookings domestically on hand, so we have a good base. And the base we have is substantially better than the base we had going into July and August at minus 60 days. So we see a much better base. And then of course, the core economics of the industry's capacity continuing to come down and going back into a more normalized business season where business tends to tick up from August to September. So I think when you think about one of our core strengths being business, July and August, that's not ever been peak for business. So as we move back into the business season given the trends we've seen in business demand, we think that will be another uplift. So really confident about our September numbers and really confident that not only is domestic improving substantially but international is also improving dramatically. Conor Cunningham : Helpful. And then maybe bigger picture, the issue that we've been grappling with is just like the overall structure of the industry over the next couple of years. I get the idea that the current state of industry margins need to change outside of you and United. But can you just give us -- how confident are you that there will actually be structural changes going forward? Because the pushback we get is that this is kind of just the same old industry that just continues to oversupply the market from time-to-time. So just any thoughts on the bigger industry picture there. Thank you. Glen Hauenstein : Well, I'll comment on the capacity and then let Ed take the broader question. On capacity, I do think, listen this is an industry that's always challenging itself for how much capacity can it be in the marketplace. And I've been doing this for 40 years and I've never seen the industry react so quickly to an oversupply. So we've really only been in an oversupply situation for a couple of months here, and the industry has already reacted. And I think that's very different than it was years ago where it would stay for prolonged periods of time. So I'm really excited about how the industry is behaving at this point. And for the broader question, I'll turn it back to Ed. Ed Bastian : Yes, Conor. To Glen's point the law of economics or physics, whatever you want to say, is going to have to work. You cannot, if you are on the lower end of the industry's food chain, continue to post losses, particularly given the health of the demand set we've all seen over these last couple of years. So I don't know what form that will take, but I guarantee you, and you're already starting to see, capacity is usually the first thing that you -- lever you have available, but there will be more levers available as well. The health of the industry broadly is in pretty good shape. Now I recognize what I just said. The lower half is struggling. But if you look at where we all need to go as an industry is that we need to continue to better differentiate and provide value to our customers. Value in this industry for many years was defined as having the lowest fare in the market. That's changed. That's changed dramatically. The experience economy that we've seen that is taken hold, that's driven the high demand set that we are seeing and continue to see and even with the third quarter revenue \"disappointment\" is still going to be a record set of revenues that we are going to see this quarter. I'm convinced across the industry is rewarding those that are providing real value, meaning a better quality experience, better value for money in terms of the product we are offering and reliability. Couple that with the higher cost of entry, higher than we've ever seen, whether it is labor, whether it's the constraints in the environment, the infrastructure, OEM, engine supply, this is turning into an industry that is going to be needing to return its cost of capital or it will not be -- those that don't will not be given the opportunity to continue to run the business models they have. So I realize I'm talking my own book. And I appreciate that there is a lot of other work that others need to lift. Listen, we are driving 50% of the overall industry profitability here at Delta. There's only so much more we can do on our own. And as things get better, Delta is only going to be a beneficiary. Conor Cunningham : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is live. Savi Syth : Hi, good morning everyone. Just I think kind of the Boeing challenges are well understood but the update from Airbus a few weeks ago was surprising. And -- I wonder if you could talk about how you are managing through the supply chain issues. And any early thoughts on how you're thinking things evolve in 2025 in terms of just managing the operation but also in terms of kind of planning for growth. Ed Bastian : Savi, this is Ed. I'll take that. Airbus, like Boeing continues to have certain delivery challenges, obviously nowhere close to the challenges that Boeing has experienced. And as one of Airbus' largest and best customers, Delta again is insulated somewhat from that. We are going to take largely the delivery schedule that we anticipated for the year. Yes, some may slip but you're talking about slip meaning in terms of weeks and months, not years of delay. And as long as we have, as we do have, pretty good notice of where the delays in delivery are coming, we will be just fine. In 2025, I don't anticipate us having any problems with the aircraft that we are going to need for the capacity we'd like to deploy. Savi Syth : And I'm guessing then on an operational standpoint, maybe not expecting any improvements either, just having just extra buffers will continue? Ed Bastian : Well, we have a large fleet and our maintenance capabilities continue to improve. The challenge we face on the maintenance front tend to be more parts supply than anything else, as well as all these new engine platforms that are out there from the GTF to the lead to the trend stabilizing, but they continue to get better. And I think the opportunities for us, as things stabilize and as parts become more available and as new aircraft continue to deliver, will be for us to resume the retirement of our older fleet, which we indicated in the release we are already starting to do and which will create even more part availability back to our maintenance team. Savi Syth : That's helpful. Thanks Ed. And if I might, Glen ask about on the LATAM side, you mentioned kind of encouraged about what you are seeing there. I was kind of curious on the unit revenue pressure. Is that still coming from short-haul with long-haul still largely flattish even despite the growth? And where are you expecting the improvement as you go through? Glen Hauenstein : Actually, long-haul south has inflected to positive and it is remaining solidly positive throughout the third quarter here. So we're pretty excited about those results. And yes, still not lapping the reduction in capacity in the leisure short-haul portfolio. But that is in play, and it looks that the industry is going to be much more disciplined in terms of capacity levels this winter versus last winter. So we are looking at really positive momentum of that moving forward and that continuing. Savi Syth : Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Your line is live. Jamie Baker : Good morning everybody. So Glen, there is a concept of unbundling the front cabin is one that I've been thinking about in part because unbundling and segmenting the rear cabin has been such a success for Delta and a few others. I want to be careful about asking about future pricing on that. But I'm curious what the pros and cons are in terms of possibly going down this path? Or is one price for all how we should continue to think about the D One cabin? Glen Hauenstein : I think you're going to have to come to Investor Day to hear more about that. We've talked conceptually about that. I think we'll be giving you more details as we get, but we are not ready to talk about the details of those plans moving forward. I think the Investor Day this year should be very exciting. Jamie Baker : I'm confident I will work it into my schedule. And then maybe for Ed or for Glen, but at a high level, it seems that those airlines that are currently under duress, are sort of beginning to lean into premium, and maybe premium is too strong of a term, but some of the more punitive ancillary charges, change fees are disappearing. There is an option of an empty middle seat. Southwest has said they're looking at some sort of enhancement to their product. I'm just curious if this is something you and the team think about. The conventional wisdom is that premium spoils belong to Delta. But what we're seeing today is that Delta is not entirely isolated from low-end overcapacity. I'm just thinking down the road if we could find Delta isn't as isolated from, let's call it pseudo-premium overcapacity. Any thoughts there? Thanks in advance. Ed Bastian : Well, Jamie, it's a good question. It's certainly something that we all look at. Premium is more than just putting more seats -- excuse me, more room in seats. And it's the overall experience, right? And yes, I think all of those experiments that we hear about some of the lower fare airlines or the discount airlines are considering, you can't blame them. I would -- if I was consider some of those as well. But premium is also based on a foundation of overall reliability and service, first and foremost, and that's what we have focused on and specialized and done better over the last 15 years and then the airline, we continue to get better. In fact, the operations we've run this year are the best in the industry across every measure, every month, month in and month out. That gives you then freedom to actually deliver true premium experience as compared to somewhat maybe more superficial experience. And that, to me is what we are best at. That's why business travelers choose Delta. That's why we have the opportunities internationally that we do. That's why American Express, the top credit card provider in the world, in my opinion chooses Delta as their exclusive partner. So I think there is room for more. And I would -- the industry needs to continue to find better ways in which to manage the higher costs that they are facing. Remember, the cost to serve has gone up for everybody but especially for the discounters. And the only way you can cover that is providing a better experience. Jamie Baker : That\u2019s great, Ed. Thank you very much for that response. Take care. See you at Investor Day. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Tom Fitzgerald from TD. Your line is live. Tom Fitzgerald : Hi everyone. Thanks very much for the time. So sticking with the premium cabin for a little bit, would you mind just unpacking just some of the trends in the first half and outlook in the second half, just among the different buckets like D One, Premium Select, domestic first class and Comfort+, paid load factors, booking, anything else notable you'd call out? Thanks. Glen Hauenstein : That's a lot. I think what we are very excited about this year is this is the first year that we have ubiquity in Delta Premium Select. And that program has exceeded our internal expectations with load factors in the mid-to-high 80s and fare structures that are more than 2 times what coach fares are. So really great margins there, great margins continuing in D One, domestic first leading the pack in domestic industry. We're really excited to start rolling out DPS in the [TransCon] (ph) this fall with all of our JFK-LA for those of you who follow this industry. The largest revenue market in the country is JFK-LA and having a full suite of products in that marketplace, we think will be very accretive. And we're out selling it now and September, October, advances already look very strong there. So I think continuing that elevation, the margins continue to be really in sequence with the best products continuing to have the highest margins and the Main Cabin coach having the lowest margins. Tom Fitzgerald : That's really helpful. Thanks for that color Glen. And then just quickly, if I may, one for Dan. How should we think of, and this is a topic for the whole industry, I think but just how are you and the team thinking about the PSP loans resetting to a variable rate? I think it's SOFR plus 2 in 2025 and 2026 and just in the context of the broader deleveraging story. Thanks again for that time. Dan Janki : Yes. As you know, we continue to focus on deleveraging. We've made a lot of progress since October [\u201820] (ph), $24 billion of debt. So deleveraging will continue to be at the forefront. When you think about those particular tranches, our first one doesn't come due. It's April of second quarter of next year. And then we have another tranche in first quarter and second quarter of 2026. We'll look at market conditions at that point in time, where we are on short-term rates versus long-term rates and whether that would be long part term part of the capital structure, it makes more sense to put in other types of debt and refi that out. And those will be things that we'll probably talk more about in detail as we get closer, especially at Investor Day, but as we get to the end of the year and the beginning of next year. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Mike Linenberg : Hi, good morning everyone. I guess this is a question to Dan and even the team. It's always very helpful when you guys call out where your air traffic liability is and how much it's up at least since year-end. I sort of think we are at a point in the year where over the next few weeks, that's going to shift the other way. And I think it's going to be a bit more pronounced for some of those who maybe have a more seasonal Northern Hemisphere type route network. When I think about, maybe Glen, you talk about the extension of like transatlantic and also the strength that you're seeing to deep South America and how that's going to improve in the back part of the year combined with corporate. How should we think about your swings in your air traffic liability? I mean, in the past it used to be a much bigger hit to cash. And I still think for some carriers, it is going to be a bit of a wake-up call as we get into the back half of the year. But I think for you guys, like how should we think about it and maybe some of the measures that you've done to sort of mitigate that? Thanks and I have a follow-up. Dan Janki : Through the first half, it is up. You can see that it's up $2.4 billion. It's up a few hundred million dollars over last year where it supports our revenue forecast for third quarter. As you get into the back half of the year, certainly the elongation of the tattled season helps as it relates to balance that as you go through third quarter and into fourth quarter. And also the fact that corporate continues to outgrow consumer, that is also bringing it back into what I'd say is a more normalized curve as it relates to historical perspective. When you look at it year-over-year, you still got the oddity of last year, you had multiple years of travel cut. So this is the first year that it's much cleaner as we go through and create a better base as you think about it for '24 and '25 and start to evaluate it. Mike Linenberg : Great. And then just my second question. I think Ed or Glen, you talked about capacity cuts being one of the first levers that we'll see from other carriers. As we think about where they cut back and maybe certain airports in particular, is there an opportunity maybe for you to pick up additional gate space in some of your bigger airports? I sort of think of some of the cutbacks coming back potentially in Atlanta, Orlando, opportunities where things are tight you'll get additional real estate. Any thoughts on that? Ed Bastian : Thanks, Mike. Listen, all I can say on that is we're always interested in serving underserved communities. Mike Linenberg : Okay, very good. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Your line is live. Scott Group : Hi, thanks. Good morning. So we've talked a lot about just the overall industry capacity outlook, but I want to try and get a little bit of Delta color, right? So your capacity was up 8% in the second quarter, you're saying 5% to 6% in the third quarter. I guess, any color you can share on your capacity plans entering 2025 just to help get the industry supply-demand more in balance? Do you anticipate getting to a GDP or sub-GDP type capacity growth? Or do you think as you plan for Delta specifically, do you think you stay above GDP? Glen Hauenstein : I think we are not going to give capacity growth for 2025 at this point. We've got a lot of runway left in this year. I\u2019d point out one thing that I think is really important that we ought to just note is that the difference between seats and ASMs. And many of you work your models on ASMs. Others work on seats. And I would think when you're looking within an entity, it's really the seat count that is most important because we don't sell ASMs, we sell seats. And when you think about our capacity growth although it was 8%, we only grew our seats at about 5% or less. So there is a stage length difference. And our stage length is actually a little bit longer than we had in the plan because we saw some opportunities on some of the longer-haul flying as people restructure through the year. So I'd call it back to, let's not talk about ASMs. Let's talk about seats within theater. So I think that's a much better representation of what the industry is facing and one we ought to all key in on as we move forward and trying to figure out where the industry is going. So too early for '25 in terms of capacity. That will be clearly over the back half of the year, we'll reveal more about that. But secondly, try to think about seats as our measure domestically is what we're trying to sell. Dan Janki : And the thing I'd add on to that Glen, is that 80% of that domestic capacity growth is going into our core hubs. And to Glen's point, important point on seats, as we get into the back half of this year and fourth quarter is the first time we'll have our core hubs, restored to levels that they were from a seat perspective versus 2019. Glen Hauenstein : Still versus '19, we are the least restored in terms of seats. Dan Janki : Yes. Scott Group : Okay. And then Dan, I just want to -- when I think about the guide, right, if I just take the midpoint of the Q3 guide and then the midpoint of the full year guide, it basically implies fourth quarter earnings, just absolute earnings, pretty similar with the third quarter, and that's pretty atypical, right? It's usually -- we usually see a step down. Any color on how to think about that dynamic this year might be different? Dan Janki : Yes. Well, fourth quarter last year was the only quarter we were down year-over-year. You also had very high fuel in the fourth quarter last year at $3. The current -- we'll have to see where that plays out, but the current forward of that is much lower so you get that benefit. And I think it's also with regards to the components that Glen's talked about is the inflection in unit revenue as you exit September moving positive and the elongated travel season and that strong international demand. Scott Group : Thank you guys. Appreciate the time. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Your line is live. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Good morning and thank you guys. Maybe just taking the last two questions and putting it together, your Q4 guide is a bit wide. And how do you think about the industry capacity issues? Does it get better? Does it get more rational or does it get worse in '25 if Boeing gets the delivery cadence back? Ed Bastian : Sheila, hi this is Ed. I just want to be clear, we haven't given explicit Q4 guide. So I appreciate your models driving us there. We still have our full year guide with a pretty wide range as you noted in there. You may recall last year at this time, when things were really starting to look promising, we upped our full year guide and we got punished a few months later as the fuel [guides] (ph) worked against us. So we're confident we'll end up in a good point within the full year range. But I don't really want to get into trying to figure out what Q4 is here. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Can you maybe comment on how you think about Boeing's delivery cadence improving next year and how that impacts the industry? Ed Bastian : Well, as I mentioned, we are confident in our Airbus delivery stream. We have no Boeing aircraft coming over the next handful of years I anticipate. I think it will take some time before Boeing gets their cadence back. I know they're slowly starting to improve and we'll see. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is live. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hi, thanks good morning. Just a follow-up on corporate travel into September and beyond. Can you remind us what the headwind was in the fourth quarter of last year from strikes in the auto and entertainment industries? Glen Hauenstein : So if you recall, yes we were heading into the writers' strike right about this time last year, and we were in the auto in the -- really in October time frame at its peak. So that was a -- I believe, we think that's about $100 million in terms of a headwind for us or a tailwind this year as we come into the fourth quarter. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thanks. And Glen, maybe just to stick with you. Can you talk a little bit about your outlook for transatlantic in 3Q overall, maybe overall and ex-Paris? Any bookings commentary you could point to post the Olympics? Appreciate you taking the questions. Glen Hauenstein : Yes. Well, ex Paris, we were positive. And so for those of you who follow my bet with -- and I lost my bet because Paris was a little bit bigger than we thought. So actually--. Duane Pfennigwerth : I didn't want to remind you of it on the call but I'm glad you brought it up. Glen Hauenstein : That was an expensive miss for me, so good for the employee care fund though. And so as we look at past the Olympics, we see a very robust fall demand for transatlantic. And we're too early to say that it's inflected to positive yet because we have -- but it could very well inflect to positive. I would be disappointed if it didn't, but that's a personal opinion, not an official guide. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is live. Brandon Oglenski : Hi, good morning everyone. And thanks for taking my question. Ed or Glen, if I can come back to Scott's first question, thinking about things you can control, especially as margins aren't at your target yet. Ed, I know you talked a lot about industry capacity coming down into the fourth quarter. But maybe beyond your own capacity in the seats discussion, what are other levers you guys are pulling behind the scenes here to help drive improvement? Ed Bastian : Well, I think there is quite a bit. Clearly, as the demand set that we see in our specific customer base continues to look healthy, we are going to continue investing there. We've got a pretty robust set of new offerings coming in, in the premium space. Wi-Fi is going to be free and fast and fully available -- and largely fully available on the transatlantic by the end of the summer, which is a big deal for us. On the cost side, we had really good cost performance in the first half of the year. I anticipate that we're going to continue to hold that. I realize the third quarter [guide's had] (ph) touch larger than what we saw in Q2, but we're going to work hard to get that back down. I think we've all talked about the opportunity this year on the cost front to continue to grow into our larger headcount. We are not there yet. We still have more growth opportunities to get there. So I think across the board, Brandon, we have opportunities. And we are certainly not sitting back waiting for the industry to fix itself. If that was the case, we wouldn't be delivering the outstanding level of profitability that we are. But we hope that, that's going to be another tailwind for Delta. Brandon Oglenski : I appreciate that response. And maybe, Dan as a follow-up, can you talk about headcount trends into next year and if you are seeing efficiencies as you restore your core hubs? Dan Janki : Yes, we are. And just this year alone, we will have headcount that will grow -- our resources will grow just under 2% while we are growing the network at mid-single digits. And I think -- and that's been the case even versus trailing 12 months, we're up only 3% on our resources versus the growth that we've demonstrated. And I think that -- and delivered. So I think that is kind of the leading edge of us, the step here, first few steps here of us growing back into those resources and those capabilities. And it is just not people, right? It's the aircraft and the utilization of the aircraft. It's growing into the airports and the investment that we made. Glen always reminds me, the most expensive day is the first day that you open it. So it's across the board. Ed Bastian : And one other thing, Brandon this is Ed again. Don't lose sight of the free cash we're throwing off. This year, we'll throw off between $3 billion and $4 billion. I'm confident in that guide which we gave at the start of the year. I expect at least as good next year again. The compounded effect of all that cash and we'll continue to delever the balance sheet is once again going to differentiate Delta within this industry. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you both. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live. Ravi Shanker : Thanks, good morning everyone. I just want to follow up -- a couple of follow-ups here. One is on the international commentary. You guys said a couple of times international is looking pretty strong through the fall. Is that just spillover, like from the air pocket for the Olympics kind of spreading to other periods? Are you seeing an acceleration there in any particular geographies? If you can unpack that, that would be great. Glen Hauenstein : I think generally, we see the season extending as a whole group of people, whether or not it's retirees, whether or not it's people with double incomes and without children, who don't have the school concerns. It is actually a better time to go to Europe in September and October than it is potentially in July and August when the weather is so hot and everything is so packed. So we are really seeing an extension into September and October and really into through November that European demand across the Board is remaining strong. So that's very exciting for us. The same thing is happening in the leisure markets in the Pacific. Interestingly enough, Japan has turned into a US point-of-sale leisure market with the Yen hitting at JPY160. So we have really record numbers of US tourists heading to Japan, which is such a great destination. And again, that has a very strong fall season. So really looking at US origin, high-end leisure extending the season through October and into November. Ravi Shanker : Understood. That's great color. And maybe a follow-up on the previous discussion on the premiumization of the industry. Kind of as the lower-cost carriers push towards premium, I just wanted to kind of clarify your comments. Are you saying that there is more opportunity for you guys to kind of push up kind of as the bottom comes up? And kind of do you have a sense of how high you can go? Or I mean, there is also some concern that as others premiumize, there is going to be more competition for a fixed set of premium demand. How do you see that playing out? Ed Bastian : Well, I think it's both. We have and we continue to have opportunities to grow premium. Premium's growing double digit for us and we don't see that slowing down. So Delta, on its own right, continues to grow there. And what will happen is, as others, if they do choose to continue to upgrade their products, it is going to force them to also upgrade their price points, which will help our Main Cabin revenues as well. Glen Hauenstein : That was the point, I think we should continue to reinforce is when you take away revenue streams, you have to replace them with other revenue streams. And so as the ULCCs look to make their product more value, they have to increase their base fares just to remain constant in terms of revenue. And I think that is maybe a missed point here is that's actually good for the industry. Ravi Shanker : Very helpful. Thank you. Julie Stewart : We'll now go to the final analyst Q&A. Operator : Thank you. Certainly. Your next question is coming from Andrew Didora from Bank of America. Your line is live. Andrew Didora : Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Maybe Dan, helpful commentary on the 2% fleet growth this year. And I know you aren't prepared to give the 2025 capacity growth now, but can you maybe help us think about the 2025 fleet or seat growth based on kind of where you see deliveries and expected retirements over the next 18 months? Dan Janki : Yes. I think you -- as we're taking about 40 deliveries this year, as I mentioned, give or take, one or two and how it falls out. On average, when you look forward into next year, it's around 50. We're right in that 40 to 50 range associated with that and you're going to continue to see a steady drumbeat of retirements, probably in the mid-20s as we go through 2025. We'll finalize that as we get through our final plan and tweak that regards to what it is, but it's older fleets, right, the 75s starting to see some of the 76s and the 320s. And as we've all talked about, those -- as we've been trying to grow, we haven't been able to retire it what we are used to. This is the first time we're actually meaningfully retiring aircraft over the last two years to three years. And that then benefits us, right, because that then is a material stream back into our tech-ops operation, maintenance operations that can use that material and improve efficiency, which they've been so good at through the years when you look at the last decade. Andrew Didora : Got it. That's actually very helpful. And just as my follow-up, Ed, I know you mentioned on the last call that you feel like you still have more debt than you're comfortable with. Is there any framework you can outline in terms of just give us a sense of how you think about the proper level of debt that gets you to a much more comfortable place? Thank you. Ed Bastian : Andrew, I think that's a perfect question for November. We'll answer that at that time. Andrew Didora : Great. Thank you. Julie Stewart : That will wrap up the analyst portion of the call. I'll now turn it over to Tim Mapes to start the media questions. Tim Mapes : Thank you, Julie. Matthew, if you don\u2019t mind, as we transition from the analysts to the members of the media, if you could please repeat just the instructions for getting into the call queue, please. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Leslie Josephs from CNBC. Your line is live. Leslie Josephs : Hi, good morning everybody. Just a couple of questions. For premium economy, are you seeing most travelers buy that at the onset or the outset of their booking or are they doing buy-ups after? And is that still the most profitable part of the cabin? And then on Wi-Fi, when do you expect the entire mainline fleet to have the fast and free Wi-Fi for SkyMiles members? Thanks. Ed Bastian : You want to take the first one? Glen Hauenstein : So the question was on Delta Premium Select? Leslie Josephs : Yes. Glen Hauenstein : Premium economy? We're just Premium Select. So that is mostly being bought like all of our products, at initial purchase. And as you know, we designed that to be flexible so people could do it post purchase. And they could do it with multiple forms of payment, including miles, as they upgrade for people whose companies might not allow them to buy those, that they could use their miles to upgrade into those. But still, over 80% come at initial booking. Leslie Josephs : And it's still the most profitable cabin? Glen Hauenstein : Delta Premium Select, I think in terms of profitability, it is the third most profitable, right? Our Delta One is the most profitable. It really goes down, domestic first and then Delta Premium Select. So really in terms of the hierarchy, the more premium the product, the higher the margin. Leslie Josephs : Okay. Delta One, first class domestic and then Delta Premium Select on all routes? Ed Bastian : And Leslie, on the Wi-Fi question, we are continuing to roll it out, making good progress. The focus right at the moment is getting our international fleet equipped. We'll have largely the transatlantic pretty well fully up and running by the end of the summer over the next couple of months. And our remaining focus after that is getting the regionals, as well as our any remaining domestic aircraft, which is principally the 717 fleet, up and running over the next 12 months to 18 months. So we are getting there. Certainly, on a passenger count level, we're well over 50% at the present time. Leslie Josephs : Perfect, thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question is coming from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News. Your line is live. Mary Schlangenstein : Hi, thank you. I, thaI wanted to see if you could just give us a little bit more detail on the Japan situation that you mentioned. Is that just primarily leisure? Or what is your business looking like between the US and Japan as well? Glen Hauenstein : The US and Japan business is quite strong. It has been since the end of the pandemic. And what we've seen is really a new Japan as a destination market. I think when the yen was JPY83, it was very difficult to be able to afford to go see Japan and all the great things that Japan has to offer. With the yen at JPY160, it's a very different world for US travelers, and they seem to be taking great advantage of that. Mary Schlangenstein : And what about on the business side? Glen Hauenstein : Business continues to remain strong. Mary Schlangenstein : Okay. And the other question I had was you all haven't talked for some time about the refinery and whether you're still in any sort of discussions to develop a partnership or sell the refinery. Can you give us an update on that? Dan Janki : We're not. The refinery has been running very well. The team is doing a great job. A key part of Delta. Mary Schlangenstein : Great, thank you. Dan Janki : Thank you, Mary. With that, Matthew, we're right at the hour. We'll conclude the call. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation today.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Delta Airlines September Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. My name is Matthew, and I will be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Julie Stewart : Thank you, Matthew, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our September quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining us from Atlanta today are our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Dan Janki. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta's performance and strategy. Glen will provide an update on the revenue environment, and Dan will discuss costs and our balance sheet. After the prepared remarks, we'll take analyst questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up so that we can get to as many of you as possible. After the analyst Q&A, we will move to media questions. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. Please note that Page 2 of the earnings release today outlines the impact of the CrowdStrike-caused outage on our Q3 profitability and unit metrics, consistent with our initial disclosure on August 8th. Now, I'll turn the call over to Ed. Ed Bastian : Thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Before we begin, I want to provide a quick update on Hurricane Milton. Safety of our people, customers and communities is always paramount. And to that end, we've issued a fee waiver and implemented fair caps for those who need to change their travel plans or fly out of the storm's path. We've also added additional flights and up gauged aircraft into Florida this week to accommodate those evacuating the state. Between yesterday and today, we have canceled approximately 600 flights in total, but we'll have a better sense of the impact as we learn of how our airports fared overnight. Our hearts are with all those in the Southeast who have been affected during the storm season. Now turning to our earnings report. Earlier this morning, we reported our September quarter results, consistent with our latest guidance. On an earnings per share basis, our results would have been at the high end of initial guidance, excluding the $0.45 impact from the CrowdStrike caused outage. Delta continues to lead the industry, operationally and financially, while delivering on our 2024 plan. Year-to-date, our on-time performance is best in the industry, and our completion factor leads the network carriers even when including the impact of the outage. Financially, we have delivered double-digit operating margins with nearly $3 billion of free cash flow year-to-date. And following the Fitch upgrade in July, our balance sheet now has two investment-grade ratings and our dividend yield is in line with the S&P 500. Delta's year-to-date profitability is expected to represent 50% of the industry's total profits with a double-digit return on invested capital that is more than twice the industry average, reflecting the durability of our business model. I'm incredibly proud of the Delta people for delivering these results. I want to thank them for their outstanding work during this busy summer period and their dedication to providing best-in-class service for our customers. Sharing our financial success with our people is a long-standing pillar of our culture. With this quarter's financial performance, we've accrued nearly $1 billion year-to-date towards next February's profit sharing. We expect this will be among our top profit sharing payments in Delta's history and more than the rest of the industry combined. The combination of our industry-leading reliability and best-in-class service from our people has firmly established Delta as the premium airline of choice empowers our brand momentum. The new Delta One Lounge in JFK has been an incredible success with very high customer satisfaction. Building on this momentum, this morning, we opened our new Delta One Lounge at LAX and we will be opening our third Delta One Lounge in Boston this December and a fourth in Seattle early next year. By year-end, Delta will have over 700,000 square feet across 55 Sky Clubs and three Delta One Lounges, a one-of-a-kind position across many of the largest airports in the country. On board, we are enhancing the customer experience with the rollout of our popular Delta Sync product to more than 330 aircraft, offering SkyMiles members a personalized experience that provides a smart TV on the seat back screen. More than 90% of our domestic mainline network now offers fast free Wi-Fi. And this summer, we began introducing fast-free Wi-Fi -- excuse me, fast-free in-flight Wi-Fi on long-haul international flights. Across the network, Delta's advantages continue to build. Core hubs are nearing full restoration as we close out the year, and we are harvesting the investments we've made in coastal gateways to improve margins and support profitable international growth. Around the world, we're continuing to develop our JV partnerships and leveraging our strengths. Our recently announced summer 2025 Transatlantic schedule will build on our strong performance and our largest and most profitable international region. As brand preference continues to grow, we are driving deeper levels of engagement and our SkyMiles membership is attracting a younger consumer. We have seen a significant evolution in our active member base post-COVID, with 3 million more active members under 40 years of age, more than doubling member engagement with non-air partnerships allowing us to earn a higher share of wallet. Deeper engagement with Delta drives higher customer satisfaction, reinforces loyalty and creates greater lifetime customer value. Turning to our outlook. Consumers are continuing to prioritize premium experiences, and our core customer base is in a healthy financial position with travel remaining a top spend category. Corporate travel continues to improve and Delta is well-positioned as the business carrier of choice. And importantly, domestic supply growth continues to rationalize. Across much of the industry, there has been an accelerated pace of change and we are encouraged by the actions the industry is taking to improve profitability and returns. In the December quarter, the improved revenue trends we saw in the month of September are continuing. And we expect to grow earnings 30% over last year, with pre-tax income of $1.4 billion, which would mark one of the best, if not the best, fourth quarters in our history. With this, our full year outlook for earnings is expected to be around the midpoint of our initial $6 to $7 EPS guidance from the start of the year, excluding the $0.45 impact from the CrowdStrike caused outage. As we approach the end of our three-year plan that we laid out in late 2021, we have delivered consistent financial performance, restoring our financial foundation while navigating ever changing macro in industry environments from a position of strength. Our performance is a testament to the durability we are creating at Delta, built on years of investing in our people and our product, while continuing to restore our balance sheet strength. Delta has built unmatched competitive advantages and structurally improved our business for the long-term. Next month, at our Investor Day, we will introduce an updated long-term financial framework that builds on our durability and reflects the opportunities that we see ahead to create sustainable long-term value for our owners. As we approach our 100-year anniversary next year, I've never been more excited about Delta's position and the opportunity that lies ahead. Thank you, again. And with that, let me hand it over to Glen for more details on our commercial performance. Glen Hauenstein : Thank you, Ed, and good morning. I want to start by thanking all of our employees for their hard work during this busy summer travel season. They are the Delta difference. Delta delivered September quarter revenue consistent with our latest guidance despite the impact from Hurricane Helene. During the quarter, unit revenue improved sequentially in all geographic entities reflecting the strength in travel demand and an improving industry backdrop. In the month of September, unit revenue inflected to positive in both domestic and transatlantic. Domestic industry seat growth moderated significantly from the peak in June, with the industry now growing seats in line with demand. Transatlantic benefited from ongoing strength in U.S. point of sale and a rebound in Paris demand as soon as the Olympics ended. Corporate travel sales were up 7% during the quarter, led by double-digit growth in coastal hubs with broad-based strength across sectors. Delta is the clear industry leader in offering premium experiences and more choices for our customers with significant investment across the travel experience over the last 15 years. Our new Delta One Lounges in New York and LA with dedicated check-in and private TSA security truly differentiate Delta's premium offering in the two largest revenue markets in the United States. We also introduced Delta Premium Select on TransCon flights between JFK and LA and we'll expand this offering to all daily frequencies next month. Similar to our international rollout, the initial customer reception to Delta Premium Select has far exceeded our expectations. Consistently delivering elevated experience that customers value is driving outperformance in premium products across geographies. During the quarter, premium revenue growth outperformed the main cabin by 9 points. At the same time, Delta is growing SkyMiles membership and deepening our customer engagement. The success of our strategy is best illustrated by our unit revenue premium relative to the industry, the growing loyalty of our brand and our increasingly diversified revenue base. Year-to-date, 57% of our revenue has been generated outside of selling main cabin seats, underpinning Delta's financial leadership and supporting durable performance that significantly outpaces the industry. Royalty revenue was up 6% versus last year, with growth in our SkyMiles membership and strengthen our American Express co-brand portfolio. American Express remuneration for the quarter was $1.8 billion, up 6% year-over-year, delivering solid performance and a backdrop of moderating inflation. Cargo revenue was 27% higher than last year with double-digit growth across all international regions. I am encouraged by the results and the opportunity to better leverage our increasingly cargo capable fleet. Looking forward, demand for travel on Delta remains healthy with continued preference for our premium offerings. Our recent corporate survey indicates a positive outlook for business demand with 85% of respondents indicating they expect their travel spend to grow in 2025. For the December quarter, we expect total revenue to increase 2% to 4% over prior year on a 3% to 4% higher capacity level. The improved unit revenue trends we saw in the month of September are continuing into the December quarter with healthy bookings for the holiday. As we've seen historically, domestic travel demand is impacted in the weeks surrounding the election, resulting in an expected 1 point impact to system unit revenue for the quarter. With favorable industry capacity dynamics and a strong demand set, we are well positioned as we close out the year and head into 2025. Our industry leadership and differentiation has never been greater creating the foundation for us to unlock the value of our trusted customer brand and further diversify our revenue base. In closing, I'm excited about our opportunities ahead, and I look forward to sharing more with you at our Investor Day next month. And with that, let me turn it over to Dan. Dan Janki : Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. Operationally, our teams delivered through a busy summer travel season. Year-to-date, Delta has achieved 60 days of zero cancellations, nearly twice all of last year. Today, we reported another quarter of strong financial performance with $1.3 billion of pretax income for the September quarter. On non-fuel unit costs, performance was in line with our expectations. Unit costs grew 5.7%, including a 3.2 point impact from the CrowdStrike caused outage and a 0.5 point impact from the decision to reward employees with travel passes for their hard work through the summer. Now fuel prices declined 9% over prior year, averaging $2.53 per gallon for the quarter, including a $0.03 loss from the refinery. Fuel efficiency improved approximately 1% year-over-year. During the quarter, we took delivery of nine next-gen Airbus aircraft and retired six aircraft. We continue to expect our fleet growth to be less than 2% this year with 20 net aircraft additions as half of our new deliveries are replacements. Operating cash flow year-to-date was $6.2 billion. After reinvesting $3.6 billion back into the business, we generated free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Strong cash generation has supported debt repayment of $2.4 billion year-to-date, including $900 million of early repayments. Gross leverage ended the quarter at 2.9 times. For the year, we expect to repay nearly $4 billion of debt, bringing our cumulative debt paydown to more than $12 billion over the last three years. As we retire secured debt, and pay cash for our aircraft, our unencumbered asset base is expected to grow to $30 billion by year end. Our financial foundation continues to strengthen. We achieved a meaningful milestone during the quarter with our balance sheet receiving an upgrade to investment grade from Fitch. Delta is now investment grade rated at Moody's and Fitch and one notch away at S&P with a positive outlook. Now moving to guidance. For the December quarter, we expect to deliver 2 points of margin, operating margin expansion and earnings growth of 30% compared to the prior year. Fuel prices are expected to be $2.20 to $2.40 per gallon, more than 20% lower year-over-year, including a few cent impact from a modest loss at the refinery. Unit costs are expected to be up 3% from last year as capacity growth moderates to 3% to 4%, keeping our full year outlook for non-fuel costs in line with our initial guidance of up low-single digit. With hiring and training normalizing, we are growing into our resources and gaining traction on efficiency and initiatives, helping fund continued investments in our people and brand. December quarter earnings are expected to be $1.60 to $1.85 per share on 11% to 13% operating margins. We are focused on finishing the year strong, delivering industry leading performance with a return to earnings growth and margin expansion, positioning us well as we head into 2025. Delta's differentiation has never been greater. Our brand and financial performance are transcending the industry, and we are generating a return on invested capital that is 5 points ahead of our cost of capital and better than half of the S&P 500. Looking forward, we remain focused on delivering durable earnings and cash generation that enable us to further strengthen our balance sheet and create long-term value for our shareholders. I look forward to sharing more details with you at our Investor Day next month. In closing, our performance is a result of the hard work of our employees. I want to thank the Delta people for continuing to go above and beyond for our customers and each other every day. Now with that, I'll turn it back to Julie for Q&A. Julie Stewart : Thanks, Dan. Matthew, can you please go to the first analyst question? Operator : Certainly, at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from David Vernon from Bernstein. Your line is live. David Vernon : So Glen, first question for you on the election. Can you just help us get comfortable with how you're separating out that impact from what you're seeing internally? And maybe talk to what gives you confidence that this isn't just a weakness in the consumer that's showing up in some of the forward revenue data? Thanks. Glen Hauenstein : Absolutely. I think it's -- if you were looking at our internal numbers, it's really obvious to see the trend lines where you have markets that are performing incredibly well with positive momentum in October. And then again, as soon as the week after the election is complete, and on into December and really all the way into January. So if you took a trend line, you would see these two weeks just being way off trend. And I think it's -- we said in the comments that it's domestic, but it's also short haul Latin. It's pretty much across the board that those two weeks are underperforming the trends before and after those weeks. David Vernon : Okay. And then maybe just, Ed, can you talk at a high level about how Delta is thinking about domestic capacity kind of going forward, lower cost airlines cutting capacity? Does that make you think about share any differently here? Ed Bastian : Well, David, that's a great prelude into next month's Investor Day, where we'll be giving you our perspective on that. We did, is file our summer schedule last week and Atlanta is one of the markets where we are finally at a position to be at, if not better, than pre-COVID levels in capacity. So very excited about that. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Your line is live. Jamie Baker : Thanks and good morning, everyone. A couple for Glen. So Glen, when I think about the phenomenon of tightening domestic capacity, my assumption has always been that the first routes that are culled provide the greatest uplift to RASM and from there RASM benefits still accrue over time, but at sort of a declining rate of improvement. Is that the right way to be thinking about it that the benefits are front end loaded or is the reality of something different? Glen Hauenstein : Well, Jamie, I'm trying to understand whose perspective you're looking at that from? Are you looking at it from the perspective of the people who are cutting the capacity or the people who are the beneficiary of those capacity cuts? Jamie Baker : The latter, the beneficiary, so Delta in this case. Glen Hauenstein : I would say, if you think about how it it was just normal course of business, and this is just hypothetical, that if you're cutting capacity, you're cutting your worse routes first, so the upside accrual from that to the remaining capacity is actually the least. And as you move through and go up to better and better capacity cuts that more and more accrues to the remaining capacity. Jamie Baker : Okay. All right. That's very helpful. And then second, on corporate demand, I'm curious what sort of recovery you're thinking about for 2025? But more importantly, does it influence how you think about the network? I mean, hypothetically, I'm not arguing that this would happen. But if we saw a full restoration to where corporate trends would be had COVID not occurred would you need to rebalance the network much or would it simply be an exercise of potentially allocating less capacity to lower fare buckets? Thanks. Glen Hauenstein : Yeah. I would suggest it's the latter. Jamie Baker : Okay. Glen Hauenstein : As we pointed out that premium products are really doing much better currently than coach. And as we move through the next couple of schedule changes and adjustments heading into the tail end of the year, we expect that momentum to pick up as the carriers that have primarily coach products begin rationalizing capacity. So I think we always have room for our business customers onboard our network. And clearly, if certain companies pick up business or start new factories, we're always talking to our clients to see where they might need additional capacity. But generally, I think we're in a very good spot. Jamie Baker : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is live. Savi Syth : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Glen, I was wondering, if you could give a little bit more color on how you're thinking about kind of the unit revenue projection in the fourth quarter by entities and just the kind of the trends beyond the elections? Glen Hauenstein : Yeah. I got -- something is wrong with your phone there. So you're asking about trends after the election by entity? Dan Janki : For unit revenue? Savi Syth : What your expectations are? Glen Hauenstein : Right. I think, we certainly said that domestic and transatlantic are leading the way, and I think that will continue as we head into the back half of the year. Actually, I'm most excited about this winter in the transatlantic where we've done some capacity adjustments and underperforming capacity last year, and we see really encouraging signs of where we've allocated that capacity, along with robust demand in the off-season. So really looking forward to the transatlantic results. Pacific, we had some more -- some additional capacity. And as we head out of this year, I think it's -- Japan looks strong, the South Pacific looks strong. China is looking stronger as we lapse the big increase in capacity last year. And we're seeing a little weakness in South Korea, but nothing major, and so we'll keep an eye on that. And then Latin is continuing its improvement as we move through the quarter. And hopefully, we can inflect that into positive as we move into January and beyond. So I think we're sitting in a pretty good spot with all entities as we head out of this year and into 2025 and very encouraged by the trends when you look beyond the election. Savi Syth : Very helpful. Thank you. And if I might, just on the -- follow-up on the Hurricane Helene impact. You called out, the impact of $0.03. I know it's really early days. I was just kind of curious if you have kind of the impact of Hurricane Milton in your guidance and how you're thinking about it? Ed Bastian : It's too early to give you that, Savi. We'll have to see what happens. If we're fortunate and it's moved out quickly, it will be modest, but we really have to see. Savi Syth : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live. Mike Linenberg : Yeah. Hey, Glen. I recall -- I want to say this was either the last conference call or maybe it was a conference where I think you were asked about where organic demand was relative to the fact that we were seeing demand up 7%, 8% in the summer. And I think you had indicated that actually a lot of it was promotional \u2013 driven by promotions and then our organic demand was maybe closer to about 4% domestically. When I heard you talk about in the comments in your script, you talked about domestic where it seems like supply and demand are now in sync. And if I look at where domestic supply is right now, it is about 1.5%, 2%. Are you sort of indicating that maybe domestic demand organically is around 2%? Are we running a little bit better than that? Can you just \u2013 some additional color on that? Glen Hauenstein : Yeah. I think we haven't gotten there yet. So it's really impossible for me to say. But I would -- I think we are still in that kind of 4%-ish. So we'll see, if capacity is up 1.5% or 2% as we get through these next few months. And we see continued positive momentum in yield that will tell. And I think that's what we're encouraged about. And that's what we're excited about as we head to the end of this year as we think this balance has been -- has not been as good in quite some time. Mike Linenberg : Great. And then just my second question, I think, on the distribution front, it does look like you've -- I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, you may have recently sort of renewed your agreements with all of the GDSs. And I know that you've been moving more into sort of the -- on the NDC side with respect to distribution. How should we think about that, your cost of distribution. Is that going to be maybe a potential tailwind as we head into 2025? Thanks for taking my question. Glen Hauenstein : I think our strategy is really one, we want to meet customers where they want to be and if they're going to use -- if they want to use OTAs, if they want to use GDS, we want to have the best suite of products in each one of those. And over time, I think you've seen a decrease in distribution costs and will that continue? I don't know, that's what consumers want to do. And I think our job is to make sure that we have best-in-class products on the shelves at all of our distributors. Mike Linenberg : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Your line is live. Conor Cunningham : Hi, everyone. Thank you. Really outside of you guys and United, the industry continues to try to reinvent itself through product and network changes. When you think about the opportunity that presents to you, just how aggressive do you like pretend -- like thinking -- or thinking about being just given the turmoil and others, like, you\u2019re already deepening your moat like in real time. I\u2019m just trying to understand how deep it is or how deep you can get it from here? Thanks. Glen Hauenstein : First, I think we'll have much more to talk about that at Investor Day because that really goes to the strategy in the next three years. But I think our strategy is consistent to develop free cash flow, pay down our debt and that to be a great moat in the long-term. So maybe I'll turn it over to Dan to talk about that. Dan Janki : I think as you -- Conor, as you -- we want to build off of our success that we had. And if you look at it even over the last decade, but even over the last 18 months, that durability of earnings to be double-digit when the industry has been down and to deliver double-digit margins over that period of time, I think, continue to speak to the durability of the franchise and the ability to create the profitability but generate the cash. And Glen picked up on a word there, which is consistency. You're just going to consistently see us do it, whether it's how we execute commercially, where we put our aircraft, the amount of aircraft that we're taking, the investment back in the business, we're just -- that consistency of executing the strategy has always been core to Delta and will continue to be core. Conor Cunningham : Okay. That's helpful. And then we're starting to hear a little bit more or see the products that the domestic leisure carriers are offering. And when you look at Delta Comfort+ in that offering and compare it to what the industry is announcing, you talked a little bit about Delta Sync, but what else is there to kind of to widen that gap to the new products that are already out there or that are being announced, I should say? Thank you. Glen Hauenstein : I hope you're available in November to come to our Investor Day because I think we'll have a lot of exciting things for you to take a look at. Dan Janki : Coming out theme today. Ed Bastian : Hey, Conor. This is Ed. And Glen is right. We'll be spending a lot of time talking about that next month. But this is a platform we've been on for 15 years, right? So I understand how others are now looking to adapt. It's really hard to change course and to try to catch what is a train that's moving at a pretty good speed. I should say, a plane really moving at a pretty good speed or whether it's the investment in the lounges that you're seeing and the Delta One experience, the free Wi-Fi, and I know everybody wants to do free Wi-Fi now. And we\u2019ve been out on this for years. And so we\u2019ll continue on the pace we\u2019re on. We\u2019re not going to change course. If anything, we\u2019re just going to continue to accelerate. Conor Cunningham : See you in a month. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is live. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just on seasonality, obviously, there's a lot of or a bit of noise right now in the baseline with hurricane impacts and with holiday shifts here in October. But as we look at volume growth for the industry, it looks like trends are following much more 2019 baseline than they are really last year. And so I wanted to ask you, do you see seasonality changing on the leisure side or on the corporate travel side, and was there anything about this time last year that was an anomaly? Glen Hauenstein : Well, you mentioned one, it was the shift of the Jewish holidays into October for September, of course, the hurricanes. But I think if you take a broader longer-term vision, we have seen really, August, in particular, but to a slightly lesser extent, July become less peaky, particularly in long-haul international and that September and October are becoming prime travel months. And I think that's something that will continue as schools continue to go back earlier in a lot of the country. And the weather in Europe in August is really hot and that people who have choices when they can take their vacations, are moving into, let's call it, more temperate months. Corporate, we haven't seen much change year-over-year, but I think it's continuing to shift travel to Europe, in particular, from July and August peak to a September and October peak. Duane Pfennigwerth : That's helpful. And then just -- thanks, Glen. Just for my follow-up, as you think about more modest fleet growth, less training investment, less maintenance investment, maybe there should be a question mark at the end of that one, going forward. What inning are we in for productivity recovery at Delta and what metrics should we be watching on that front? Thank you. Dan Janki : We are -- thanks, Duane. Yes. We're still in the early innings of where we -- and we're pleased with the progress, if you look at how we ended last year in the last six months and you look at this year up, low-single digits. We expect to be 2% for the year on non-fuel cost. You're starting to see that. I think one of the proxies that we've always talked about is that we put the workforce in ahead of the operation and growth and that you'd see efficiency come off of that. So if I point you to something, look at third quarter workforce year-over-year, it's up 1.5% and the network is up over 5%, right? So you're starting to grow into those resources and drive that efficiency across your work groups. But as I talked about, different parts of our operation are a different journey and we're just starting. As you know this year, we made an incremental investment in maintenance that we talked about, the $350 million, that's having the impact that we wanted, maintenance cancels are down 75% year-to-date year-over-year. And so -- but that part of the productivity will start as we get into next year and the year beyond and the year beyond, as we make progress against that. The same with our crews. And so you're seeing it in operations that have already started, airport operations, our customer care operations, making good progress on efficiency and more will kick in as we go through next year. And we'll get the benefit of the full year of having our core hubs restored, which are a low-cost -- that will be the full impact next year, and we're going to continue to get utilization out of the fleet and better utilization out of the regional aircraft will be by next summer, 100% restored on those and continue to get better wide-body utilization as we get this extended flying season and counter seasonal flying. So all those are -- the things that you saw started today are things that you're going to hear us talk about at our Investor Day, and you're going to hear us through '25 and '26 just be components that we can build on. Ed Bastian : And Duane, technology also plays a big role in that continued productivity opportunity as we now have our team fully up to speed and the development, the experience set where we want it to be, we'll be able to leverage those tools a little better going forward. Duane Pfennigwerth : Great. Appreciate the thoughts. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Your line is live. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning. So I know, Glen, you don't typically talk much about like monthly trends, but just directionally, just so we understand, can you maybe give some color, like, is October in your view of December, right, if we eliminate the November and the elections, are October and December positive on unit revenue? Glen Hauenstein : Yeah. We're not going to give that level of detail, but I would say that October and December are significantly better than November. Scott Group : Okay. Fair enough. And then, Dan, can you just maybe talk about some of the puts and takes to be thinking about for CASM next year? I know we'll get probably more of a guide at the Analyst Day, but just directionally just puts and takes to be thinking about? Dan Janki : Yeah. I\u2019d say building off of \u2013 thanks, Scott. Building off the previous question, and we will share more at Investor Day. But the context is, again, consistency, right? Things that you saw this year, we\u2019re going to continue to invest back into our workforce, continue to invest back into our brand. You\u2019re going to see those consistently. But at the same time, you\u2019re going to have the benefits of efficiency growing into that workforce. You\u2019ve got the elements that I talked about with maintenance. We know \u2013 we put the incremental investment in, we\u2019ll start to get those elements back the crew, the other components associated with that. And then as Ed mentioned, longer term, technology, you start to get it next year, but that will come for years to come, the industry is built for it and we\u2019re built for it. Scott Group : All right. Thank you, guys. Glen Hauenstein : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is live. Brandon Oglenski : Hey. Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. So Ed or Glen, you guys did volunteer, so maybe I'll try to provide a little bit of a preview of Investor Day out of here. But you did talk about Atlanta being up in the summer schedule next year. I think you even have a news article saying flights could be up high-single digit levels. Can you maybe specifically speak to that aspect of the strategy as you look forward without maybe giving too much away? Glen Hauenstein : Sure. We have really wanted, as we've said earlier in the -- coming out of COVID to solidify our positions in the coastal cities. And I think as you look at where we are today, clearly the leader in Boston, we assert ourselves as the leader in New York, made incremental improvements in Seattle and widened our lead in Los Angeles. So I put a checkmark on those. At -- to the detriment of the core hubs because we just didn't have enough assets to do it all at once. And so we're really focused, and we'll talk much more about this next week. Next year is really about some incremental adds, of course, that are key to continuing our journey in the coastal gateways. But a vast majority of that going back into our core hubs as the regional jets come back to full utilization as we can push utilization up. And I think if you take a long-term view of Atlanta over the -- not just last year or the year before, but where we've come, it's really about driving efficiency through our core hub, which represents about 30% to 35% of our total unit revenues that flow through here and really driving efficiency through that with larger gauge with actually fewer frequencies still than we had in '19, but seats that will be above that level. So another push through gauge through Atlanta as well as then taking those smaller airplanes and building our feed network back in Detroit and Minneapolis. So we're really excited about where we're going to go next year. We're going to have much more details about that all next month, but we're pumped about where we're headed for '25. Brandon Oglenski : Really appreciate that, Glen. And then, Dan, maybe just as a quick follow-up on that. I mean does this have broader implications for your airport costs because those seem to be part of the inflationary pressures here on the industry at whole. Going back to your core hubs, does that have a positive impact looking ahead? Dan Janki : Yeah. When you look at that airport line, you see it in the SEC filings, right, for the quarter and year-to-date, it's up over 20%. And a third of that is these investments we made that we're making in these generational assets. And as Glen always reminds me, they're always the most expensive on day one and you grow into them over time. So the opportunity in front of us is to grow in and get better utilization out of those assets that we've invested in over this period of time. And you see it throughout the network. It's all the places that Glen talked about in regards to the New York markets with both LaGuardia, JFK, LA, Salt Lake City, but also the investment we consistently make year-in and year-out through Atlanta and continue to make that the flagship of Delta. So it will give us continued leverage. Ed Bastian : The thing I would add, Brandon, is that the bulk of those investments are behind us. And as we see what's going on in the industry, we know there's other airports, not necessarily Delta core hubs that still have work to go. So this is something that we're going to be able to leverage over the next few years, having made the investment and starting to drive better efficiency. And I think it will be a unique opportunity for us. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Tom Fitzgerald from TD Cowen. Your line is live. Tom Fitzgerald : Thanks very much for the time. This past summer, United launched an advertising network, depending on the success of that, is that something you'd look to be a fast-follower on? Ed Bastian : This is Ed. We'll have to see what it is. There's a lot of advertising and promotion being talked about. There's not a lot of doing on that front. We're very comfortable with where we sit in that space with the free Wi-Fi, Delta Sync and the continued investment in personalization. We're not looking to push ads or try to monetize our customers as much as provide greater value to them. And I think that's the sustainable strategy over time. Tom Fitzgerald : Thanks very much. And then just if I may, a quick modeling question. Does your fuel guide include a refinery -- or assume a refinery benefit or a refinery headwind? Thanks again for the time everyone. Dan Janki : Yes, Tom. It has a few cents loss so a headwind as it relates to the guide. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live. Ravi Shanker : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. You guys were pretty vocal on the 2Q call that the industry had to take out capacity in 3Q and 4Q. From where you sit right now, looking at 1Q capacity, how do you feel about that? And do you feel like it's in a good spot or maybe there's more to come out or kind of how does that evolve? Glen Hauenstein : I don't think we want to comment about any individual. But in aggregate, I think we're encouraged by where the industry is finishing this year and likely that the way things have been loading into the schedule availability tapes, that there's probably more to come out of the first quarter, but that's a hypothesis, not a fact. Ravi Shanker : Understood. And maybe just a follow-up for Dan. Congrats on the investment grade here. Obviously, kind of big change from the pandemic time. Where does that lead the balance sheet kind of going into '25 and how do you think about continued debt paydown versus cash return? Dan Janki : Yeah. That's another one we'll spend time within next month, so stay tuned on that. But again, back to consistency, we're going to be continuing to be focused on cash generation, consistent reinvestment back into the business and with a primary focus on debt and debt paydown, continue to strengthen the balance sheet, and effectively returning capital that way to investors through the accretion of the equity value of enterprise value. Ravi Shanker : Understood. Lots went back next month looking forward to it Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Your line is live. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Hi. Good morning, Ed, Glen, Dan. Maybe two questions on premium. So if you look at premium cabin, it's outperformed main cabin by 9 points over the past two quarters versus the previous trend of about 5 points. So first, I guess, can we talk about the spread? How long does that continue? Does main cabin catch up or does premium have more to go? Glen Hauenstein : I'll take a stab at it, and Dan, feel free to add your comments. I think it's a little bit of both. I think we've got main cabin underperforming, and that was really what drove capacity rationalization, I think, by the industry because if all you have is main cabin you need to fix supply so you can get your unit revenues moving in the right direction. So I think we've seen that occurring right now and through the end of the year is that those incremental cuts -- capacity cuts come into play. So I would assume that main cabin, as we exit this year, is starting to improve on the margin. But we also think there's more to go on the premium products. And I think not to keep harping in on saying, come next month and join us for our Investor Day. But I think we'll be able to unveil why and how we think those can continue to improve over the medium and long term. Dan Janki : Yes. I agree with both. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Maybe the second question on that same topic. How do we think about the margin implications of the benefit in the main cabin catch-up, which is clearly underperforming? Does it have a lesser impact on margins as we head into '25 or do you see premium and main continuing to grow at the same rate? Glen Hauenstein : I think, yeah, I think that's hard to say that we parse that out at this point in time. But I think what we're seeing is a much more constructive backdrop in both, whether or not it's the continued increase in business travel as well as better distribution of our products and services in the premium cabins or whether or not it's the better supply/demand balance and coach. But I think all of those are coming into play as we head towards the end of this year. Dan Janki : Yes. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Andrew Didora from Bank of America. Your line is live. Andrew Didora : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Most of my questions have already been asked. But I know I've kind of asked this on some past calls, but as we prepare for Investor Day next month, and we think about the long-term free cash flow generation potential at Delta. Dan, can you just give us a sense of kind of when you become a cash taxpayer? And I think when you were a cash taxpayer pre-pandemic, your cash tax rate was in the low to mid-teens. Does that still hold? Any color around that would be helpful. Thank you. Dan Janki : Certainly, I'm happy to talk about cash taxes. It's a pleasure to actually be in a position where in a plan and horizon, we will be a cash taxpayer. We expect to start paying some cash taxes next year as we burn through the deferred tax asset positions that we've had, and we'll step into that over the next three years. And as you think about that -- the stabilized cash tax rate, it really depends also on where tax policy goes, legislation goes, but think of it as it will progress to the high-teens, maybe the low 20s, but we still have many years in front of us related to that. Andrew Didora : Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just a second one for Glen. Just from transatlantic commentary seems very positive. It seems like competitive capacity there looks pretty constructive over -- from what we can see in schedules. How would you rank the potential for transatlantic revenue generation amongst all of your entities as we head into 2025? Thank you. Glen Hauenstein : Yeah. I think domestic is going to be quite strong given the capacity levels that we're exiting the year from, and I think transatlantic will follow right behind. We have a lot of lapsing in Pacific in terms of capacity that we've added up this year that I think will be better next year. So we have some uplift there. And then, there's been -- again, we haven't talked about it much on this call, but there's been a significant amount of capacity rationalization in the leisure markets in Latin America, which I think should serve us well. So hopefully, we're looking at all of them turning into positives sometime next year, but I'd say probably domestic and transatlantic being the strongest of the two. Andrew Didora : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Glen Hauenstein : [indiscernible] I'm sorry. Julie Stewart : Matthew, we will now go to our final analyst question. Operator : Certainly. Your next question is coming from Stephen Trent from Citi. Your line is live. Stephen Trent : Good morning, everyone and thanks very much for taking my question. Just wanted to dig in a little more. You mentioned your technology investments. I think I recall seeing Delta TechOps is using drones to help with -- in equipment inspections. And could you mention maybe sort of broadly thinking how you may deploy innovative solutions across your business? Thank you. Ed Bastian : Sure, Stephen. Again, we'll talk a little bit about this next month. But we have, I think, great opportunities with the technology foundation that we've built. We are in the very early stages of understanding the potential of AI for our business, and there's no question that there are some really interesting applications to drive better predictive modeling and opportunities, whether that's on the revenue front or on the efficiency and the cost front. And the thing with AI is that you need to -- especially as you scale it, you need to make sure that your foundation is clean and reliable. And that's what we've been working on doing. So big opportunities to come, and stay tuned. Stephen Trent : Super. Well, I'm looking forward to November and thank you very much for the time. Julie Stewart : That will wrap the analyst portion of the call. I'll now turn it over to Tim Mapes to start the media questions. Tim Mapes : Thank you, Julie. Matthew, if you don't mind, while we transition from the analysts to members of the media, if we could repeat the instructions and for the call queue, please. Operator : Certainly. At this time, we will be conducting a Q&A session for media questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Your first question is coming from Leslie Josephs from CNBC. Your line is live. Leslie Josephs : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Just curious on the shoulder season, you mentioned, Glen, I just wanted to clarify, you said that September and October are more like the previous July and August because of the weather changes. And then, I also wanted to ask about your premium product offerings. You've been investing a lot, obviously, the LA and New York Delta One Lounges and just lounges in general. What are you thinking about for hard products, specifically Delta One? And what are some of the features that customers are asking for that maybe you're not offering now or what are some of the areas that you'd like to improve there in the cabin? Thanks. Glen Hauenstein : Well, Leslie, I think what I said was, October and December are the better months in November is the one that's off trend because of the election. So I think that's what I said on the earlier call. Yeah, September 2. And October looked a lot like September. Leslie Josephs : Okay. I thought you mentioned talking about the heat in Europe. I wasn't sure if that's like a permanent shift. Glen Hauenstein : The transatlantic demand profile is switching from July and August being super peak to more of a -- not having as big a peak in July and August and moving that travel into September and October. So it's an interesting change. Leslie Josephs : Got it. It is hot. And then on the hard product, what's your thinking there, especially for the [Multiple Speakers]? Glen Hauenstein : I think you have the whole Investor Day next month that we want to talk about it. So I don't think we want to unveil it here on this call, but hopefully, you have time to join us, and we'll talk a lot about where we want to take premium products in the next four to five years at that meeting. Leslie Josephs : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Alison Sider from Wall Street Journal. Your line is live. Alison Sider : Thanks so much. Curious, I had an air traffic control airspace question. Curious, what you're seeing in New York, if the shift to Philadelphia is kind of how that's working out for your other New York operations, if you're seeing the hope for benefits or if you've had any problems there? Peter Carter : Hey, Ali. It's Peter Carter. So we were with the FAA about a week ago talking about all of this. And what I would say is that the N90s shift seems to have gone well, but we still have the same constraints in the New York aerospace that we've had for the last couple of years. So as we all know, there's a shortage of air traffic controllers. And I think the FAA is obviously engaged in trying to solve that, but it's going to take some time. Alison Sider : And is New York kind of still the major -- that airspace is kind of like the major bottleneck in the system? Like, how much does that ripple out to the rest of the country? Peter Carter : It's New York -- Florida, we're seeing some constraints as well. Alison Sider : Thank you. Tim Mapes : Thanks, Ali. Matthew, we have time for one final question, please. Operator : Certainly. Your next question is coming from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News. Your line is live. Mary Schlangenstein : Thank you. Earlier when you were talking about the rebuilding of the core hubs and you made a reference to getting all of your regional feedback up, can you give just sort of an overview of what happened with your regional feed since the pandemic and how that like maybe what level it dropped to and how it's rebuilt? Glen Hauenstein : Certainly, as you know, pilot constraints as the majors were hiring early in the recovery period put a lot of strain on availability of pilot crews for the regional carriers, all of them and we've been working very closely with them. And now that the industry growth are patterns are back to more normalized requirements or next year, we think the industry will generate about 5,000 new pilot jobs, which is about what it did in 2019. So returning to more normalized pilot hiring across the industry. The dearth of capacity in terms of pilots available for regionals is dissipating very quickly. And so, in the beginning, we probably had only 35% to 40% of our capacity available. Most recently, this past year, it\u2019s been more like 65% to 70%. And by next summer, we think that will be back to 100% of the capacity that we had available in 2019. Mary Schlangenstein : Thank you. Tim Mapes : Thank you, Mary. Matthew, that will wrap us up on the media questions, please. Operator : Certainly. Julie Stewart : Thank you for joining the call today, and we look forward to talking to you again in January. I think many of you next month at our Investor Day. Thank you very much. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation today.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Delta Air Lines December Quarter and Full Year 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. My name is Matthew, and I will be your coordinator. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Julie Stewart : Thank you, Matthew. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our December quarter and full year 2024 earnings call. Joining us from Atlanta today are our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Dan Janki. Ed will open the call with an overview of performance and strategy. Glen Hauenstein will provide an update on the revenue environment, and Dan Janki will discuss costs and our balance sheet. After the prepared remarks, we'll take analyst questions. We ask you please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up so we can get to as many of you as possible. And after the analyst Q&A, we'll move to our media questions. As a reminder, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta Air Lines, Inc.'s SEC filings. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ed. Ed Bastian : Well, thank you, Julie, and good morning. We appreciate everyone joining us today. Before we start, the hearts of the entire Delta Air Lines, Inc. family go out to all those who are being impacted by the devastating wildfires in Southern California. We're incredibly grateful to the heroic first responders who are working at great personal risk to keep our community safe. We announced yesterday that Delta Air Lines, Inc. will donate $1 million to the American Red Cross to aid the individuals, families, and communities in the region who have been affected. I also wanted to say a few words on the recent passing of President Carter. As a Georgia-based airline, his life and legacy have had a deep impact on Delta Air Lines, Inc.'s mission to connect the world. Among his many accomplishments, his administration led the deregulation of our industry, making air travel more accessible and affordable to all Americans. I had the privilege of knowing President Carter and traveled with him on multiple occasions. He always took the time to personally greet our staff and every single customer on each flight we were on. He was as gracious and genuine a leader as I've ever met, truly a great man. His life of service embodied our motto to always keep climbing, and on behalf of the entire Delta Air Lines, Inc. family, we honor his memory and celebrate the many achievements of President Carter's life. Earlier this morning, we reported December quarter and full-year results. The Delta Air Lines, Inc. team delivered a strong close to the year both operationally and financially. We reported a December quarter pre-tax profit of $1.6 billion with earnings per share of $1.85 at the top end of our guidance on record revenue and outstanding operational performance. This marks the largest December quarter profit in Delta Air Lines, Inc.'s history, improving more than $500 million over last year. Operationally, we achieved industry-leading performance with a number one system completion factor and on-time performance amongst our peer set throughout the December quarter. I want to thank all 100,000 members of our team for their outstanding efforts, particularly during a busy holiday travel season. For the full year 2024, our operational teams delivered 78 brand-perfect days. Last week, Delta Air Lines, Inc. was recognized for the fourth consecutive year with Syrium's Platinum Award for operational excellence and as the most on-time airline in North America. Financially, we expect our results will lead the industry across all key measures. We achieved a double-digit operating margin and $5.2 billion of pre-tax income, representing nearly 50% of the industry's profitability. Our return on invested capital of 13% is in the upper half of the S&P 500 and doubled the rest of the industry. This performance reflects Delta Air Lines, Inc.'s sustained differentiation and durability. Full-year earnings per share of $6.16 was above the midpoint of our initial $6 to $7 guidance from the start of the year when normalizing for the $0.45 impact of the CrowdStrike-caused outage in the September quarter. Free cash flow is expected to lead the industry at $3.4 billion, a nearly $1.5 billion improvement over 2023. Robust cash generation supported further debt reduction and a $50 million share repurchase. Recognizing the strength of our financial foundation, S&P upgraded Delta Air Lines, Inc. last month, returning our balance sheet to investment-grade level at all three major credit agencies. Now, these results would not be possible without the incredible work of the Delta Air Lines, Inc. people. Our employees are the best in the business, and we are proud to recognize their commitment to industry-leading performance with industry-leading rewards. In 2024, we provided our employees with a 5% pay increase, and I'm pleased to announce that we will celebrate them with $1.4 billion in well-earned profit sharing on Valentine's Day in February. This will represent one of the top three profit-sharing payouts in Delta Air Lines, Inc.'s history and is expected to be more than the rest of the industry combined. The Delta Air Lines, Inc. people are our number one competitive advantage, and our 2024 performance reflects their commitment to best-in-class operations and service for our customers. Turning to our outlook, 2025 is off to a great start, and we are on track to deliver the best financial year in our history with revenue growth and margin expansion driving record profitability. Across the industry, carriers are taking action to improve their financial health, creating an increasingly constructive backdrop. The US consumer is financially healthy and continues to prioritize spending on experiences. Closing out 2024, we saw an acceleration in air travel demand from corporates and consumers, and co-brand card spending growth accelerated. This momentum is continuing into the March quarter. We expect to grow the top line by 7% to 9%, expand margins by two points, and nearly double earnings over last year. For the full year, we expect earnings per share greater than $7.35, increasing more than 20% compared to 2024 as reported. When comparing to a normalized EPS, excluding the impact of CrowdStrike, this represents growth ahead of our long-term target of 10% average annual growth. Cash generation is an important differentiator for Delta Air Lines, Inc., and in 2025, we expect to generate over $4 billion in free cash flow, supporting further debt reduction and bringing our leverage ratio down to two times or less. As we shared at Investor Day in November, Delta Air Lines, Inc. has a clear, focused strategy that capitalizes on 15 years of investment in our brand, customer experience, and financial foundation. Entering our next century of flight, Delta Air Lines, Inc. has never been more prepared. As a consumer brand that serves 200 million customers annually, we leverage innovation and technology to empower our people and further elevate the travel experience. Tuesday night, I had the honor of giving the keynote address at CES 2025 in Las Vegas at Sphere. In that unique space, we honored Delta Air Lines, Inc.'s century of connecting the world, presented our vision for the next century of flight, and previewed how Delta Air Lines, Inc. is driving innovation to deliver more seamless journeys from home to your seat, including new personalized experiences that are arriving in the coming months. This includes the introduction of Delta Concierge, the evolution of Delta Sync, and exciting new partnerships that will enable us to better anticipate customers' needs and grow the value of SkyMiles membership. Delta Concierge is a new digital tool built into the Fly Delta app, which will support members as a virtual personal assistant powered by generative AI to make travel easier and less stressful. The next phase of Delta Sync starting later this year includes a new and exclusive partnership with YouTube, the world's largest video platform, to provide access to ad-free YouTube Premium and music streaming onboard via Delta Sync seatback screens and our fast, free WiFi for SkyMiles members. And we announced an exclusive new partnership with Uber. SkyMiles members will earn miles for eligible rides and deliveries in the US. This unique relationship creates new opportunities to integrate further and expands our partnerships with category leaders, broadening the Delta SkyMiles ecosystem and the range of benefits we provide to our members every day. Together, these products and partnerships reflect our continued commitment to investing in and providing our customers with a superior travel experience. They drive greater engagement with our SkyMiles members that extend well beyond air travel, improving customer satisfaction and deepening loyalty to Delta Air Lines, Inc. In closing, Delta Air Lines, Inc.'s people continue to differentiate what we deliver for our customers and our owners. With momentum entering our 100th year, we are positioned to deliver another year of industry-leading performance. And now, I'll turn it over to Glen. Glen Hauenstein : Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by thanking our employees for their hard work and dedication in delivering a great year. December quarter revenue was a record $14.4 billion, 5.7% higher than 2023 and above the top end of our guidance on industry-leading operational performance and strong close-in demand. Post-election, we reported four of the top ten revenue days in our history and saw a step-up in booking activity from both leisure and corporate travelers, driving double-digit growth in cash sales. Total unit revenue grew four-tenths of a point over the prior year, with sequential improvement in all geographies. Domestically, unit revenues picked up nicely following the election, and international unit revenues improved across all three geographies and performed ahead of our expectations. Corporate sales grew 10% year over year, improving three points sequentially. Strength built through the quarter driven by both volume and fare, with broad-based strength geographically and across all sectors. We also saw an acceleration in co-brand trends, with American Express remuneration of nearly $2 billion during the quarter, up 14% year over year on a broad-based acceleration in card spend and acquisition. For the full year, we delivered a record revenue of $57 billion, 4% above 2023's prior record, with diversified streams, including premium, loyalty, and cargo, leading and contributing 57% of total revenue. Premium revenue performance outpaced Main Cabin throughout the year, up 8% over the prior year with positive unit revenues in all four quarters of 2024. Total loyalty revenue was up 9% over 2023, with remuneration from American Express reaching approximately $7.4 billion for the year, driven by high single-digit growth in co-brand spend and over one million new card acquisitions. We are confident in another year of high single-digit growth in co-brand remuneration in 2025 as we progress towards our long-term goal of $10 billion. Cargo revenue grew 14% over 2023 with sequential improvement throughout the year. Turning to our outlook, Delta Air Lines, Inc. is capitalizing on demand strength and improving industry dynamics. We expect March quarter revenue to be up 7% to 9% higher than last year, ahead of our capacity growth as unit revenues improved several points sequentially with progression in all geographies. Domestic demand remains robust with considerable improvement in the supply backdrop over the last few months as unprofitable supply is removed across the industry. Delta Air Lines, Inc. is well-positioned in this environment as we focus on our core strengths and optimize our core hubs. Transatlantic unit revenue is expected to lead, up mid-single digits for the second quarter in a row. Demand across the Atlantic is benefiting from strong U.S. point of sale and an extension of the season with unprecedented off-peak results. We have good visibility into the spring and summer and expect another year of record profitability in our largest international entity. Latin unit revenue is expected to improve sequentially for the third consecutive quarter and inflect positive as capacity investments mature, particularly in long-haul South America where we have increased connectivity with our partner LATAM. The Pacific is leading in overall revenue growth. Unit revenues are expected to be modestly negative on mid-teens capacity increases. Trends are improving sequentially, and margins continue to be at record levels. We congratulate our partner Korean Air on closing their acquisition of Asiana. We look forward to expanding our joint venture and increasing our options for our joint venture customers along the Pacific following the integration. This merger will facilitate even better connectivity and opportunity to further expand our operations to Seoul over the coming years. Turning to our network plans for the full year, as we noted in Investor Day, we expect to increase capacity with more than 85% of incremental seats in premium cabins. Domestically, 80% of our growth will be in our most profitable core hubs, and internationally, growth is normalizing following our multi-year restoration and industrialization phase. We are confident in our ability to drive margin improvement in 2025 as we focus on efficient growth across high-margin premium cabins in our most profitable hubs. And we are well-positioned to capture upside in the main cabin margins as industry health improves. In closing, we had a great 2024, and I'm excited about Delta Air Lines, Inc.'s opportunity to make our centennial the best year in our history. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan to talk about the financials. Dan Janki : Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. I'm incredibly proud of the Delta Air Lines, Inc. team for their hard work in 2024. We closed out the year in a position of strength. In the December quarter, we delivered a record fourth-quarter revenue and profit, with earnings of $1.85 per share, at the top end of our guidance and more than 40% higher year over year. Operating margins of 12% were up two points over the prior year. For the full year, we reported a double-digit operating margin, earnings of $6.16 per share, and a return on invested capital of 13%. With strong operational performance through the year and a company-wide focus on efficiency, the teams delivered on our full-year target of low single-digit non-fuel unit cost growth. During the year, we invested in our people through pay and benefit increases, and in our customers with the ongoing rollout of our fast, free WiFi for SkyMiles members, the introduction of our free Delta One lounges, and the completion of generational airport upgrades. Delta Air Lines, Inc. is investing at levels unmatched in the industry while delivering better relative non-fuel cost performance. Operating cash flow for the full year was $8 billion, and after reinvesting $4.8 billion back into the business, we generated free cash flow of $3.4 billion. Strong cash generation supported debt repayment of $4 billion, including $1 billion of early repayments. We ended 2024 with gross leverage at 2.6 times and uncovered assets of $30 billion. In the December quarter, our balance sheet returned to investment grade at all three major credit rating agencies, differentiating Delta Air Lines, Inc. and reflecting our financial durability. Now turning to our outlook. As part of our ongoing effort to focus on the primary financial metrics that drive shareholder value, we are providing full-year guidance that aligns with the three to five-year financial framework, including EPS, cash flow, and leverage. On a quarterly basis, we'll be providing guidance for revenue growth, operating margins, and EPS, along with directional color on unit metrics. For the March quarter, we expect revenue growth of 7% to 9%, an operating margin of 6% to 8%, and earnings of $0.70 to $1 per share. This represents more than two points of margin expansion and a nearly doubling of earnings at the midpoint. Non-fuel unit cost growth in the March quarter is expected to be up low single digits year over year, with performance similar to the December quarter. As the year progresses, we should see improvement in non-fuel cost growth as we continue to drive efficiency. For the full year, we expect earnings per share ahead of our long-term average annual growth target of 10%, with earnings of greater than $7.35 per share, free cash flow of greater than $4 billion, and leverage of two times or less. This outlook incorporates margin expansion opportunities in our control, including improvements from revenue mix as we grow high-margin streams like premium and loyalty while driving efficiency across the business. As Ed and Glen noted, there is potential for additional margin upside from the main cabin. We expect non-fuel unit cost growth consistent with our performance in 2024 and our long-term target of low single digits, even as it is down two to three points from last year's growth, as we are better able to leverage our existing assets and maintenance expense begins to normalize. This will help fund ongoing investments in our people and our customer experience. In 2025, half our expected capacity growth is being funded by improved utilization of both our mainline and regional fleets, with incremental capacity deployed primarily into our high-margin core hubs. We are growing into our workforce and expect another year where headcount growth is below capacity as our people gain experience with opportunities across our operational groups. 2025 is the final year of our generational airport developments. With their completion, we are now well-positioned for the next several decades with a premium ground experience that is unique to Delta Air Lines, Inc. Given the long-term nature of these investments, cost per employment will improve over time as we grow into our assets. Strong cash flow remains an important differentiator for Delta Air Lines, Inc. Our outlook for more than $4 billion of free cash flow is 10% of our current market cap and more than a $500 million improvement over 2024. In terms of capital allocation, we expect to reinvest $5 billion of capital into the business, including approximately 40 aircraft deliveries and continued investment in technology and facilities, including Sky Clubs and Delta One lounges. Beyond investing in the business, debt paydown remains our priority. We plan to pay cash for $3 billion of our 2025 debt maturities this year and will opportunistically repay higher-cost debt to end the year with gross leverage of two times or less, progressing towards our long-term target of one times. In closing, Delta Air Lines, Inc. is executing against our long-term financial framework and creating significant value as we expand margins, deliver durable earnings and free cash flow, and further strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet. Returns remain industry-leading, and we expect to make progress towards our return on invested capital target of 15% this year. We are excited about our momentum as we enter a historic year for Delta Air Lines, Inc. I would like to thank our people for all they do every day. And with that, I'll turn it back to Julie. Julie Stewart : Thanks, Dan. Matthew, we will now open it up for analyst Q&A. Star star one on your phone at this time. We do ask that while posing your question, star one on your phone. Your first question is coming from Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs. Your line is live. Catherine O'Brien: Hi, everyone. Thanks so much for the time. It's good to be back on one of these things. So maybe just start. I don't want to be greedy after a fourth-quarter beat and fourth-quarter revenue guide that was much higher than I was expecting. But I'd love to dig in on the greater piece of your greater than $7.35 full-year guide, and Dan hinted at that a little bit in his prepared remarks. But, you know, if we can assume that your prior commentary around mid-single-digit revenue growth for the full year stands, and you're starting off with high single-digit growth, would it be fair to assume that the $7.35 has a pretty conservative back-half revenue outlook baked in there? And then outside of potential revenue upside, what else drives that upside from $7.35? Thanks so much. Dan Janki : Well, as we talked about at Investor Day, and you think about it with, as you talked about, with capacity growth in the low single digits, revenue growth of 5%, and when you think about margin expansion of about 50 basis points, that gives you about 10% earnings growth. So with this forecast, we're focused on things that we can control as it relates to our capacity, where we're putting it, the premium revenue growth, loyalty, those types of elements, along with driving efficiencies from a Delta Air Lines, Inc. perspective. And that provides us the confidence, and we have good visibility as we sit here today as it relates to the first quarter and really the first half of the year. Good about that. The second half will unfold as we progress, and we'll give you more coloring and context on that. And as I mentioned in the note, I think the industry construct and how it evolves through the year, and especially the back half as it relates to the main cabin that we've talked about, that could provide additional upside as it relates to margins as we progress through the year. Catherine O'Brien: That's great. Thanks. And then maybe one for Glen, a quick one. In the press release, you noted that all geographic entities came in stronger in the fourth quarter than you were initially expecting. Was there any one standout in terms of the magnitude of that improvement? And how do these trends inform your view on capacity allocation geographically over the course of 2025? Thanks so much for the time, everyone. Glen Hauenstein : Well, I would say the outstanding performance was in the transatlantic. As most everybody knows, the summer IOT season is the peak, and the winter is the off-peak. And usually, we're not able to generate significant returns in the off-peak, many months in the off-peak. And just really, really strong, not only advanced bookings but close-in business travel going into transatlantic has been incredibly strong. And you know, you asked what is driving that, and it's really US point of origin. Again, today, the dollar was up again. The euro is down to 1.02. Europe is an incredibly screaming buy as a tourist destination. And people are finding that particularly in southern Europe, the weather is actually pretty nice in the winter, and the streets aren't as crowded. So it's not a bad time to go. So I think, you know, we've got a confluence of a lot of things happening, but all of those are favorable. Catherine O'Brien: Thank you so much. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is live. Brandon Oglenski : Hi. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on the results. It's great to see the market taking notice. Ed, definitely exciting at CES this week, and I know you guys announced a lot of new partnerships, but maybe can you elaborate more for investors on how you plan to monetize SkyMiles going forward, especially with Sync and some of the new things you announced this week? Ed Bastian : Well, thanks, Brandon. It was good that you were out there to see it. It was an exciting week for Delta Air Lines, Inc. The question of monetization is interesting. We're not announcing these partnerships so that we could start taking and starting to try to capture revenue immediately out of it. This is all about creating a much longer-term relationship and experience-based platform for our customers. The monetization opportunities will unfold in due course. The more valuable item in my mind is how we're growing the value of a SkyMiles membership and wanting our customers to continue to demonstrate an even greater amount of loyalty to Delta Air Lines, Inc. as part of that, giving them more reason to be flying Delta Air Lines, Inc. than ever before in every step of the journey. The Uber relationship is unique, and it's exclusive, and it's new. It's something that as we think about Uber and the impact not just for Uber but Uber Eats as well, I think will have a big impact on them as well as with us. YouTube is going to be a huge enhancement for our in-flight entertainment product offerings, and it's going to drive more and more sign-ups to be part of the SkyMiles program. So we'll talk about monetization at some point in the journey, but that's not the initial focus. Brandon Oglenski : Definitely appreciate that, Ed. And then, Dan, can you give us some insight into some of the levers you're pulling this year on keeping CAS in low single digits? Maybe we underappreciate how much network restoration costs were in the last couple of years? Dan Janki : Yeah. I think consistent with many of the items that we talked about at Investor Day, it really comes down to the investments that we'll make in cost related to our people on the growth and seniority. We still have in 2025 the airports coming online and the full run rate of those developments along with the rate and inflationary elements that we're seeing in those will be somewhat consistent with what we saw in 2024. The continued investment in customer experience. But then, as you were alluding to on the efficiency side, it's really getting better utilization out of our assets and investments that we made. Part of it is the fleet and the network. It's about, you know, the growth is going into the higher margin. Glen alluded to it. The premium seats are driving the vast majority of the seats that we're adding. The capacity that we're adding is going into the low-cost, high-margin, core hub structures. Over 80% of the incremental capacity. Half of the growth of capacity is coming from the utilization of the fleet. Mainline and regionals, we expect the regionals to be back to full flying of our assets. We have that capability, so that inefficiency has been sitting as part of our financials in our run rate associated with it. You know, the workforce, the Delta Air Lines, Inc. teams and contractors, we put that capability in. Ed really pushed us and the team to put that capability and get that operational excellence as we restore the airline, and we're growing into that experience. So this year, you saw us grow the airline 6%, and on average, headcount was up 2%. We ended the year on a year-over-year basis flat. As we start to now step down into 3% to 4% growth. So you're starting to see that experience come through and getting that. And then we think in Delta Air Lines, Inc., we have a unique element as it relates to maintenance. John and the team at TechOps, we've had a high level of volume of activity that will start to normalize, and then you get the improvement in that whole maintenance supply chain. Turnaround times are still, as they talked about at Investor Day, well above historical levels. They were stable in 2024. But in 2025, we expect to start to make progress. The question will be, how much progress does the industry make? And we want to be part of leading that improvement and driving that efficiency. And that team there is gaining experience. So across all these, I wouldn't say they were network inefficiencies, I'd say, just across the company. We have the opportunity for broad-based efficiencies and grow into our airports. Those will move over with time, and then we also talked about this at Investor Day. I think we're just at the doorstep of what technology can unlock over the long term, and that big, big dollars associated with that in 2025, but that's multi-year for the next three to five years that we're quite excited about what that can do for the company. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you both for the answers. Julie Stewart : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Your line is live. Conor Cunningham : Hi, everyone. Thank you. Glen, obviously, a really, really solid start for 1Q. But there's a lot of moving parts this year from the calendar, and I think you benefited from the MAX grounding last year. So your comps are actually particularly difficult. So shouldn't we expect a somewhat strong sequential acceleration into the spring? Just trying to understand if, like, your actual core results are even stronger than what you're reporting here today, even though those are really good too as well. Just any thoughts, sir. Thank you. Glen Hauenstein : Well, I'd just say, you know, we're experiencing a very, very strong demand period as we see our sales in January. We usually don't post record sales. We've had two of our top record sales days since the beginning of the year. And so I think, you know, early signs are that this is going to be a very, very strong year for us. It's too early to call the second and third and fourth quarters. But what we can see in the first quarter and maybe into April is a really, really strong demand set across all entities. Conor Cunningham : Helpful. And then maybe I think a lot of the discussion is around the idea of, like, better supply in the US domestic market. But I think there's an argument to be made that there's an even better supply story on the international side. You know, wide bodies are hard to come by, you know, there's some engine issues there as well. Can you just talk about the international setup as you look from a supply standpoint and what that could mean for the Atlantic again this year? Thank you. Glen Hauenstein : Yeah. We're really, really excited about the way the spring and summer are shaping up in terms of competitive capacity in the transatlantic. And, you know, I think all the base points are in there for another record year in the transatlantic. Again, early in the booking, we had the real big transatlantic booking season coming up over the next month and a half as people firm up their plans for summer travel. But I expect that we're going to see a very, very robust return. And I'd also point out that last year, we had the Olympics in Paris, which was a very big negative for us as we passed through the summer quarter starting in late June and through the July and August peak. So I think not only do we have a great competitive dynamic, but we also have some things that are uniquely beneficial to Delta Air Lines, Inc. as you look at this summer's performance in the transatlantic for Slack server, knowing how big we are in Paris. Conor Cunningham : Awesome. Thank you. Julie Stewart : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Tom Fitzgerald from TD Cowen. Your line is live. Tom Fitzgerald : Hi, everyone. Thanks so much for the time. Could you mind maybe elaborating a little bit on what you're seeing across customer segments, business and leisure, as well as by age cohorts, so maybe boomers and Gen X versus some of the millennials? Glen Hauenstein : Sure. Well, I'm happy to report first on the second part of the question. If boomers are driving the premium, being a boomer myself, I'm proud of us driving our premium results, which is, I think, great for now, but also great for later because we know as people continue, as this cohort continues to age out and the new generation passes that threshold of wanting to buy more premium products and service, the newer generation is wealthier. And we have a bigger share of that generation. So excited not only for today, if the boomers are driving it, but excited for tomorrow as we pass it on to the next generations. So that's the question on and then across the spectrum. Consumer leisure, very strong. Demand across corporates is very strong. Unit revenues in the fourth quarter, as we point out, our sales in the fourth quarter were up 10% on corporate sales. Those trends are continuing into the first quarter, so continued very strong growth. Our survey is out. We survey the corporate traveler every year. The corporate travel managers, I think the number was 90% expected to exceed or meet last year's spend. So all the components that we see are driving really robust demand as we sit here in January. Tom Fitzgerald : That's really helpful. Thanks so much, Glen. And then just as a follow-up, I'd love to hear what you're seeing in some of your core hubs. You know, we've seen, obviously, Southwest pulling back in Atlanta and a lot of the low-cost and ultra-low-cost pulling back significantly out of places like Minneapolis. So curious just what you're seeing in bookings and yields there. Thanks again for the time, and congrats on the quarter. Glen Hauenstein : Alright. Well, we're not going to start giving hub-by-hub yield and traffic information. But I would say that, you know, we're very encouraged by the competitive dynamics that are going on in all of our hubs as we head into the spring and summer. With the possible exception of Boston, which is at an elevated capacity level, but I would say surprisingly resilient for us in the off-peak. You know, Boston is a very seasonal market, and we're in really the low season for Boston right now. And it's performing incredibly well despite the fact that it's got a significant amount of industry capacity. So I think we like where we're sitting. Of course, the wildfires in Los Angeles are not helping Los Angeles origin and destination. But, you know, there's always something going on. And I feel really, really good about where we sit today. Julie Stewart : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Your line is live. Jamie Baker : Good morning, everybody. So this is probably for Glen. Glen might have thoughts as well. The topic is fuel recapture. You know, at one point in the not-too-distant past, in my professional lifetime, it could take up to a year for the industry to recalibrate the higher input costs, higher fuel costs. But now, given the evolution we've been on, it now seems like higher fuel can be recaptured somewhere inside of two quarters. When we think about that past precedent, though, yield production was, I don't know, kind of modest. Whereas today, we're in a strong environment, at least in most markets. So that's my question. With yields already being pretty strong, do you think that that alters the calculus? Does it make it harder and longer to recapture higher fuel? Or do we still get to that 100% recapture mark inside of a couple of quarters? Glen Hauenstein : I believe that it's never been shorter. And that's a personal belief based on how the industry is responding and the fact that the bottom half of the industry is under intense pressure to continue to improve its results. So I think that backdrop is what you have to focus on in terms of fuel recapture. The industry needs to recapture that fuel faster than it has in the past. Dan Janki : Yeah, and not only fuel, but all that. I mean, margins are at very low levels, and they have to be captured. Non-fuel cost and fuel cost, improved margins overall. So I think that's the backdrop that Ed talked about in regards to the improving industrial industry backdrop that we're sitting in. Jamie Baker : Excellent. And then just a quick follow-up on corporate. You know, post-COVID, Delta Air Lines, Inc. and some of your competitors have talked about changes in how business travelers are flying, you know, that's had some impact on day-of-week demand, you know, somewhat elongated booking curve. There's my question. As corporate continues to rebound, is corporate behavior beginning to revert back to the way that it used to be, or are those behavioral trends that you're seeing today kind of consistent with the post-COVID world that we live in? Thanks in advance. Glen Hauenstein : I'd say on the margin, it's reverting. But it's still different. On the margin, closing has picked up because the booking curves had elongated during the COVID recovery. It has come in over the past year or so. And, yeah, Tuesday and Wednesday travel is picking up. So I would say it's not back to where it was, but on the margin, it's coming more towards what it was. Jamie Baker : Okay. Very interesting. Thanks so much. Julie Stewart : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is live. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey. Thanks. Just to maybe continue that theme. As we play back the fourth quarter, what was the revenue surprise really driven by? There were some stronger post-election trends, which obviously some of the hotels called out. But do you think the compressed period between Thanksgiving and peak holidays actually stimulated compression in corporate? And how would you mark that corporate recovery excluding some of the seasonal noise into 2025? Glen Hauenstein : I think, clearly, for the month of December, late Thanksgiving is helpful for the month, but when you put those two months together, I don't think it's that much different whether it compresses or adjusts the press next year. November, the return date for Thanksgiving will be in November, not December. Essentially one day. And I think we'll see similar results next year. I think the big surprise for us is, again, when we did earnings, it was right after the election, right before, right after the election. And we hadn't really seen that strength of sales leading into the election, and it was a definite uptick. You could see and you could feel post-election it goes out for 365 days. That people felt more confident, and they felt a little bit less confident before the election. And it was a big inflection point. Duane Pfennigwerth : That's helpful. And then just for a follow-up, Glen, in Latin, what inning are we in for the rebuild of that entity? Delta Air Lines, Inc. has been in investment mode there for a while. When would you expect to enter harvest mode? Glen Hauenstein : I think we're, as we indicated in the script, we're toning down our investment in LATAM. We've got most of the quarters in place that we need to beat each other, and we worked on that coming out of COVID. So I wouldn't say we're moving into harvest, but we're definitely moving into a more mature position in Deep South America. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thank you. Julie Stewart : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Shannon Doherty from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live. Shannon Doherty : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just one for Glen here. With premium revenue growth continuing to outpace the main cabin, could it be possible that the RASM gap actually stays the same between the two even as you're growing your premium seat mix just given, you know, higher yields and overall enhanced product offering? Glen Hauenstein : Right. Well, I think our plan for 2025 indicates or assumes that we will continue to keep the premium revenues on the trajectory that we're on. I think the upside surprise for us would be if the main cabin starts to accelerate as we move through the year, given the fact that capacity in the industry level has come down significantly in that pool. So that's how I would frame 2025 as continued trends that we're seeing in premium, and potential upside being in the main cabin improving significantly. Shannon Doherty : Thanks. And as my follow-up here, what are your thoughts on the calendar shift with a little later Easter this year? Could it be possible that, you know, if it wasn't positive in both the March and June quarters as travelers take two trips this year instead of one? You know, like, maybe to last year. Glen Hauenstein : Spring break in winter. That's the question? I can't really hear. Shannon Doherty : Thoughts on Easter shift. Glen Hauenstein : Oh, Easter shift? Could you see more travel? Usually, a late Easter is bad for March, so good for those airlines. So we'll see how that plays out this year, but, you know, as you say, the longer that travel peak period, the better the general returns are for the season, but then the months play out differently because you compress the PPP. Which is not a good thing, but the longer season offsets that. Shannon Doherty : Alright. Thank you. Glen Hauenstein : I mean, a new word PPP. PPP sounds good to say. Compress that PPP. Julie Stewart : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live. Ravi Shanker : Great. Thanks. Morning, and happy New Year, everyone. Glen, if I can revisit the topic of Europe, just this kind of unusual strength in 1Q, you elaborated on that a little bit. But are you confident that this is not pulling forward from later in the summer? Glen Hauenstein : I am very confident. I am very confident. This is another year of, and if you think about the baby boomers' travel, if you put all if you thread all these together, you say, who's driving premium revenue? It's the boomers. Who's driving why is that happening? The euro at 1.02, you know, go to a restaurant in New York and then go to a restaurant in Europe, you'll see a vast difference in your bill. And so this is a great time to travel to Europe. People are seeing that. US consumers are very smart. They figure these things out pretty quickly. And we're seeing robust demand in the off-peak, and I'm sure that the peak is going to be even better. Ravi Shanker : I think a vast difference in the quality of the food as well. Maybe as a follow-up, how do we think about the pricing algorithm between the main cabin, mid-cabin, and the front of the plane? Sort of as you talk about more momentum in main cabin RASM, like, do you adjust front-of-plane pricing kind of in real-time to adjust for that? Or how do you see that flow through the cabins? Glen Hauenstein : Right. I think one of the reasons we decided to really focus on premium back ten or fifteen years ago was we wanted to control our own destiny. So the fact that we've been able to get this premium revenue growth despite the fact that the main cabin has been under a lot of duress. I would expect us to be able to continue to optimize that, but we've tried to disconnect the main cabin from premium products in terms of our pricing abilities. I think that'll be our strategy. We don't want to price ourselves out. We want people to continue to grow and experience this because once they do, they tend not to go back. So as we continue to put more premium seats in, driving premium revenues is going to come from higher loads, not necessarily higher yield. Ravi Shanker : Understood. Thank you. Julie Stewart : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Andrew Didora from Bank of America. Your line is live. Andrew Didora : Hey. Good morning, everyone. I guess, Glen, maybe when we look out past the first quarter, I know it's early, but the domestic schedule is showing kind of high single-digit growth in 2Q. I guess, obviously, relatively high to the 3% to 4% full-year outlook. But when I look historically, this can come in, you know, anywhere from one to three points, you know, you think that's reasonable? And then any comments or color on how you think your capacity could trend throughout the year? Glen Hauenstein : Thank you for that question because I've been looking for the opportunity to give a little bit of context to the shape of the growth. In the first quarter, we're going to be probably somewhere between four and a half and five. I think we have four seven loaded right now. We'll see what completion is, but somewhere between four and a half and five, I would assume. Depending on how the completion factor plays out. In the second quarter, we have not really loaded our schedules yet. You'll start to see this weekend, I believe, April Oh, next is going in, which will be, you know, a couple of points reduction of what we have selling out there, and you'll see us continue to bring that back into line. I would expect that June, July, and August would be our low points for year-over-year growth. And the off-peak. With a little bit more growth than you all speak to try and get better utilization back to Dan's point of how do we work the trade between unit cost and unit revenues to ensure that we're optimizing our margins. Andrew Didora : That's great color. Thank you. And then maybe just, you know, sticking on the capacity front, you know, obviously, you know, you've spoken to we've seen the strong trends in the Atlantic. Clearly, the demand is there. How should we think about your growth across the Atlantic this year? Will it be system average above or below just thinking about how that could trend as we progress through the year? Thank you. Glen Hauenstein : I think for the transatlantic, our schedules are pretty well loaded. There may be some tweaks around the edges as we move through and with aircraft availability and crew availability, but I think largely we're in place. And it's slightly above the average, not too much. Andrew Didora : Great. Thank you, Glen. Julie Stewart : Thank you. Your next question is coming from David Vernon from Bernstein. Your line is live. David Vernon : Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. So, Glen, going back to corporate demand right now, the 10% growth, is there a way that you can help us understand kind of how much of that is sort of volume, how much of that is yield? And then, you know, obviously, last year was a pretty interesting year for corporate growth with American taking a step back, Southwest participating more in GDSs. Just trying to get a sense for, you know, maybe how shares are trending in corporate from your perspective. Glen Hauenstein : So we don't comment on other people's share. What we can say is our share is at or near record highs every month. And so we've seen no deterioration in our share in the past year in the forward sales. And then as it relates to these trends, it was primarily early in the year driven by traffic, and then as we headed towards the end of the year, it was driven by both a mix of traffic and yield. So now we have yields positive and traffic positive contributing to that number. David Vernon : Excellent. Thank you. And then as you think about the ASM growth that you shaped for us, that was really helpful. Can you help us understand kind of the balance between international and domestic as we progress through the year? Glen Hauenstein : Yeah. I think probably a little bit higher on international with Latin being the lowest growth rates as we move through the year. And continuing with the Pacific, the run rates, and when we get to the latter part of this year, the Pacific will come down significantly. But the Atlantic is going to be just slightly ahead of our system average. And domestic probably just slightly below. David Vernon : Alright. Thank you, guys. Thanks for the time. Julie Stewart : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is live. Savi Syth : Hey, good morning, everyone. If I might on the CapEx front and the aircraft deliveries, I'm guessing your CapEx is still, you know, thinking is around $5 billion. But you did have kind of 46 deliveries in, sorry, 38 versus kind of a 46 assumption. Curious what you're expecting in 2025 and if that, you know, $5 billion CapEx is still a good level. Dan Janki : Yeah. $5 billion is a good level. We had a few fewer deliveries in 2024 than we expected. We expect right around 40-ish here in 2025. Savi Syth : Got it. And, Dan, maybe if I can follow up on the non-OpEx side, any color that you can provide on how we should think about it for this year in terms of kind of interest side, but also kind of a non-interest side. Dan Janki : Yeah. I think it will be think of it as flattish where you have a benefit from the deleveraging that's probably just under a $100 million benefit. And then the real question will be where does all the other pieces fall out? Pension, finalizing it, here as we go through the month of January. It performed well. It should be flattish to maybe a slight improvement. We'll see where we finally lock that in here as we get through January. We have always the moving pieces with equity earnings from our partners. And whether they'll be up or down, and that progresses for the year. We benefited from that this past year as they were better than expected, and that drove some of the improvement. And we won't have the reoccurring gains that we had from some investments that we sold. So that'll be a headwind. So I'd plan it flattish right around that $800 million mark thereabouts. And, Julie and team can kind of work with you if there's any dynamic as it relates to quarterly splits. Savi Syth : Appreciate that. Thank you. Julie Stewart : Matthew, we'll now go to our final analyst question. Matthew: Certainly. Your final question is coming from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Your line is live. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you, and good morning. Great quarter, guys. Maybe just sticking on the fleet comments, if we could elaborate, I have two questions. On just setting up retirements here again in 2025. How do you think about the number of A350 deliveries this year and how that signals to the strong Atlantic demand that you're seeing? And wondering if you're seeing any changes around how you're thinking about 767 and 757 retirement. Dan Janki : I'll take the retirement a little bit. On the retirements, we retired just over 20 aircraft in 2024. We expect in 2025 for that to be a little bit higher, probably closer to 30. Thereabouts. Kind of see how this year progresses and how the fleet plan settles in for 2026. We'll be finalizing this late spring, early summer. Associated with that. But that's a good thing. It allows John and the team to have a material flow back into the TechOps team, and they're really good about having that back into the installed base and fleet and driving efficiency associated with that. As it relates to our deliveries, when about 40 plus, just about 12, 13 of those in 2025 will be wide bodies. It's a mix of the A330s and A350s. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you. And maybe, Dan, if I could ask a follow-up on just maintenance spend. How do we think about it for 2025? As it works towards normalized levels? Dan Janki : I think it's going to move towards normalized levels. We should see an improvement year over year. We start to see that we're going to invest a little bit more year over year in the first quarter. And then you'll see it start to step down. But the normalization of that doesn't occur in one year. It's over multiple years. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Understood. Thank you. Julie Stewart : Matthew will now move to the media portion of the Q&A session. Matthew: Certainly. At this time, we'll be conducting a Q&A session for media questions. If you have any questions or comments, please press star then one on your phone. Thank you. Your first question is coming from Leslie Josephs from CNBC. Your line is live. Leslie Josephs : Hi. Good morning, everybody. Just wanted to ask about Los Angeles flights. Can you talk about the level of cancellations or delays that you're seeing, just kind of given that even in areas that aren't affected, just kind of limited resources and difficulty getting around the city, and do you expect any material impact? And then second, on the incoming administration and tariffs, do you have the ability to take planes exclusively from Mobile, in the case of narrow bodies, and anything else that you're doing to prepare for potential tariffs? Thanks. Glen Hauenstein : On the Los Angeles wildfires, we monitor sales on a daily basis by geographic region, and we have seen a decline in sales, not a wholesale reduction or an uptick in cancellations, but a decline in sales during this period. So we'll see. I think as soon as the period ends, we can probably put a wrapper around how much we thought that cost us. But I don't think it's going to be significant to the quarter. Hopefully not. Peter Carter : Hey, Leslie. It's Peter Carter on tariffs. We do have some, I'll say, alternative ways to receive delivery of aircraft to mitigate the impact of tariffs, which is what we used in the last Trump administration. Our hope, of course, is that Airbus is not subject to tariffs because, as we know, a substantial portion of those aircraft are produced in the US and employ thousands of Americans. Leslie Josephs : Thank you. Matthew: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Alison Sider from Wall Street Journal. Your line is live. Alison Sider : Hi. Thanks so much. Just curious, in the current fare environment, are you seeing any indications or have any concerns that, you know, with higher fares, there might be some inflation fatigue among consumers, you know, especially, you know, in basic or main cabin? Glen Hauenstein : You know, I think the answer to that is clearly no. We see robust demand. We see record sales, and if you think about airline tickets while coming out of COVID, there was an acceleration that reflected the new economics of the airline. Last year, inflation for airline tickets was relatively benign. So it's really driving volumes and slightly higher fares, but not anything that we think is going to destroy value over the medium or long term. Alison Sider : Hi. Thanks. And, you know, we've just seen other companies and other industries rethinking sustainability pledges and DEI commitments, and I'm just curious if there's anything you could share, if there's anything Delta Air Lines, Inc. is kind of reevaluating in either of those spaces. Peter Carter : Again, good morning. It's Peter Carter. No. We are not. We are steadfast in our commitments because we think that they are actually critical to our business. Sustainability is about being more efficient in our operations, and really, DEI is about talent, and that's been our focus. And, of course, the key differentiator at Delta Air Lines, Inc. is our people. Alison Sider : Thank you. Julie Stewart : Thanks, Ali. Matthew, we have time for one call. One more if we get one in, please? Matthew: Certainly. Your last question is coming from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News. Your line is live. Mary Schlangenstein : Hi. Thank you. I wanted to go back to the impact of the LA fires. I'm just wondering if over time, after the fires themselves are largely put out, do you expect perhaps a drop in demand in that area because all these people who have lost everything they have and are likely to be much less inclined to travel for a certain period? Glen Hauenstein : I think, unfortunately, after a natural disaster, we actually see an uptick in demand as people go in to rebuild it, insurance adjustments come from all over the country. So I'd say until it's rebuilt, you actually, you know, you never want a natural disaster. It's a terrible thing and certainly something that our hearts go out to everybody in Los Angeles who's affected by this. But from a long-term airline perspective, we face hurricanes, we face flooding, we face all that, and usually, the impacts are in the beginning phases followed by a recovery phase. If you take Asheville, for example, we are actually having more traffic to Asheville than we did in the pre-pandemic or the pre-flooding experiences as people go in to rebuild their homes and businesses. So it's an unfortunate occurrence, but I think nothing that will long-term impact. Mary Schlangenstein : Thank you. Julie Stewart : That should conclude the call today, Matthew. Thank you very much. Matthew: Thank you. That concludes today's conference call. Thank you, everyone, for your participation.",
